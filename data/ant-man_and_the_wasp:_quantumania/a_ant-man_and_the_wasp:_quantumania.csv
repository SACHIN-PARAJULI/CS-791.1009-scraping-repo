"Apr 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"In my opinion I love this movie, I love kang as the villain, Paul Rudd and Kathryn Newton were great in this movie, The fact is the cgi we're not good."
"Apr 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's not the worst thing Marvel has to offer, it's entertaining but that's all. It does not transcend to forge the future of this franchise. Many questionable performances, especially Kathryn Newton, and other performances like Jonathan Majors's a highlight."
"Apr 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Despite the colorful world and little bits of fun moments, this movie really just isn't great. Certain bits of CGI stick out like a sore thumb, even when the world in concept and certain bits of execution is colorful and fun. The main plot and overall comedy in the movie is weak despite what it attempts to set up for the MCU, and things the movie advertised like Bill Murray's appearance and other big spectacles feels messy or underutilized to say the least. I really can't say much positive about the movie other than the bits of fun it can offer throughout with some rare laughs and in-concept other big spectacles executed rather messily. All things considered - it still isn't the worst movie I've ever seen."
"Apr 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The film has some nice settings but has horrible CGI which is especially noticeable on MODOK. The film tends to be quite boring and lays the foundation for the big bad of the multiverse saga whose danger is not perceived.
Characters like Hank, his wife and Wasp are super secondary to the film almost non-existent"
"Apr 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The mighty have fallen. The modern-day MCU movie is so unbelievable, pathetic, and unserious that it's genuinely sad. This movie will leave you dumbfounded by how stupid the story is. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a 2-hour CGI mess."
"Mar 31, 2024",NEUTRAL,"You made a movie titled Quantumania with almost no Quantumania. Not a bad film at all, but what leaves a bad taste in your mouth is the wasted potential of what this could have been."
"Mar 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,The CGI was terrible. Lois was not in itüò≠.
"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE,I mean the visuals in this movie are stunning. The color choices for the scenery and the characters mesh so well together that it's almost criminal. We get to see how everything has evolved for Scott (Paul Rudd) and Hope (Evangeline Lilly).
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Disappointing is the best way to put it. I really liked the first two Ant-Man movies, but this one just felt different, and lacked the charm of those two. I liked that Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer got a lot of screen time, but the overall story just seemed like a mess."
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Literally everything wrong with the modern Marvel machine in one movie. A movie so focused on furthering the story of the Marvel Universe it forgets the reasons why we liked Scott Lang and friends in the first place. Probably because this first time screenwriter didn't even bother to watch the previous movies to understand even the basics of Scott Lang's supporting cast. Hank Pym and Cassie Lang feel nothing like they did in the previous movies and Hope Van Dyne is barely a footnote in the movie because ""The Wasp"" in Ant-Man and the Wasp is clearly referring to Janet Van Dyne and not her. But don't worry, it's not just the previous movie's supporting cast that they Marvel forgets the fundamentals for, yet again, Marvel forgets why readers of the comics enjoyed these characters as well with the inclusion and butchering of Modok. But hey, at least Modok has an arc in this film, unlike any of our main protagonists! Also forget everything you knew about the Quantum Realm from the previous films, because it is entirely different in this film. Marvel has decided to turn it into a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" rejected planet instead, one with Bill Murray and a bunch of other characters that you will forget about by the time the credits roll. Oh, and I almost forgot the morale of the story! According to Scott Lang himself, the literal morale of the story is ""Don't worry about it, it doesn't matter!"" Well Scott, if that is the case, then why are you wasting our time with yet another poorly written, over the top to it's own detriment, rushed CGI infested, slop? Maybe Marvel should go back to the drawing board and rediscover what made Phase 1 through 3 great, instead of making more movies like this one. Yikes."
"Mar 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was an okay movie, but I wanted an Ant-Man movie, not a commercial for Kang's Dynasty."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Forget it. I want to forget about this movie. Reintroduce the Quantum Realm in another movie please. This movie had 0 entertainment level. The acting was good, but it cannot save a poor plot and poor resolution in act 3"
"Feb 28, 2024",NEUTRAL,I know the first couple Ant Man movies had humor too but I swear I feel like Guardians of the Galaxy is turning into a curse on the Marvel movies.  Too many of the movies bringing in big bright and cartoony characters and comedy that feels forced.  But I am an old guy that liked the more serious tone of the pre-Disneyfied days.
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,A very poor execution of the Multiverse Saga's Idea
"Feb 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Filme mediano! √â um filme importante para acompanhar a saga.
√â um filme que da pra assistir e se entreter."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,A disappointing outing for the MCU that fumbles the Kang character and doesn't do much for the wasp character. The movie is filled with humor that sometimes lands and most of the time doesn't. Paul Rudd is still great as ant man but other than him it also has some stunning visuals and decent enough action. But all in all this film doesn't land well for me.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I loved the design of the creatures and worlds in Quantumania, but that is where my love ends.  The comedy didn't hit for me, which is surprising since they brought in Bill Murray.  The action just wasn't that great.  

Lastly the villains were extremely lackluster.  This was supposed to build Kang into the next big bad and it fails quite miserably."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,This film could be shown to new physics students as a hazing torture ritual.
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,The scenes where Antman grows into a Giant were sooo cool !!!! I hope we get to see him fight Godzilla in a future movie üçø üîÆü•∞üí≠ !?
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The editing and visuals of this movie is majestic and i  bet they put 99% of their movies budget on it don't get me wrong but it doesn't cover the unfunny stuff and cringe this monstrosity and DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THAT HORRFIFYING THING CALLED MODOCK. In summary, the movie's CGI is out of the world and acting skills fine but its cringe and barely has plot. Just a bunch of cringe and weird stuff throughout"
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Just a mid MCU movie again.  The first Ant man movie is still the better one out of the 3.

There's way too much CGI in this movie, some scenes were just really badly edited and it looked very strange.  I did like the relationship between Scott and Cassie in the beginning, would be been better if we actually got to see more conflict between father and daughter.  

Janet withholding vital information from her family dragged on for waaaaay too long.  

I haven't really been a fan of the multiverse stuff since End game, still so many inconsistancies regarding multiverses, timelines etc.  Movie 6/10 for me."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing movie and even better breaker of imagination and space-time
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Mid, forgettable, disappointing. Kang is the only redeeming factor about this film and he is shown amazingly here. But the rest of the film is a silly mess"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"What the film lacks in originality, novelty, or depth is compensated for by fully immersing the viewer in a captivating new world."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"8 years since the first movie and 5 years since the second movie Marvel Studios presents their 31st installment in their roster continuing the adventures of the hero who can shrink After the events of ‚ÄòAvengers: Endgame‚Äô Scott Lang aka Ant-Man is enjoying his fame and success and couldn‚Äôt be happier being with his girlfriend, Hope He‚Äôs written a successful book but his daughter Cassie now fully grown up played by Kathryn Newton is acting rebellious since they both lost so much time between his heroing and being snapped for 5 years Cassie wants to contribute to mankind and has even made her own suit being Stinger and created a device to contact the Quantum Realm She, Scott, Hope, Hank Pym, and Janet all get sucked into a sub-atomic universe beneath their own filled with intelligent organisms and the one in charge is a man named Kang played by Jonathan Majors He promises Scott to give him the time he lost with his daughter if he can get Kang what he wants but Janet warns him not to trust Kang, she‚Äôs been holding a secret ever since she was trapped in the Quantum Realm for 30 years It's my favorite one out of the three Some of the zippiness is absent but it doesn't skimp on the action and the best reason to see the movie is Jonathan Majors as the villain Kang, he is killing it being the next big threat having a calm demeanor but sounding menacing too Plus given the character‚Äôs abilities in the comics he can shape existence and time to his own making The music is much more intense and it's visually stimulating even scenes involving a probability storm almost matching ‚ÄòDoctor Strange‚Äô Love Kathryn Newton as older Cassie and it's crazy what they did with the MODOK character tying back to the first film Bill Murray makes a funny cameo too as Krylar They had more of the budget this time around and got creative with the designs of the world and the creatures Sad that Evangeline Lily is in less of this but I‚Äôm glad Michelle Pfeiffer has more to do than the previous film This officially starts phase 5 of the MCU with more of the multiverse involved Plus I'm anxious to see what happens later with more properties down the line ‚ÄòQuantumania‚Äô is the bigger movie of the three but I think more massive stuff is on the way"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Im not a fan of Paul's humor. This movie feels like Marvel's failed attempt to make a star wars movie. The Quantum world is a brilliant idea but feels bland and empty despite countless soulless alien characters inhabiting it. Action is ok. Cgi can be beautiful but also laughable at times. Boring. The only times I was interested is when Kang was on scene.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,totaly different andy great concept story also wounderfull
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,An average at best MCU film that disappoints on a lot of levels.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,very funny with the ant but the atlantic first king just die so fast ._.
"Feb 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,Complete dog sh*t. Terrible.
"Feb 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,It's a lower point in the MCU to date but fun enough.
"Feb 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,The story line was terrible. The acting was okay but not great. Another M-She-U failure.
"Jan 30, 2024",NEUTRAL,Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania has revived Marvel ratings a bit more with the subatomic particles that we have been missing as we really needed more fresh molecules to new storylines.
"Jan 30, 2024",NEUTRAL,"There's been a lot of hate for this movie, but it's far from the worst of the Marvel movies. While it doesn't recapture the magic of the original Antman, Jonathan Majors does a good job bringing gravitas and threat to the character of Kang. The negatives: it is hard to believe Scott's teenager daughter is some super science genius that produces technology that outstrips anything Tony Stark could do after decades of making the world's most advanced weapons, and the plot in general is far from deep. It's not clear what Kang's powers are and he sometimes seems to forget he has telekenetic powers and instead tries to street fight. Besides that the acting is good, the jokes are mildly amusing, the visuals are good, and the landscapes and characters fairly creative. This won't make everyone's list of the top 10 Marvel movies, and if it was released ten years ago it would probably have been better received. But if you're a fan of Marvel movies, you will probably enjoy it. And then forget about it."
"Jan 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"At times, it feels like a Star Wars knock-off. At others, its attempts at lightheartedness land as just embarrassing. But still, some really solid super hero sequences that make it worth the watch."
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie was unfairly criticized.  I think people were expecting to much.  This is a solid Ant-Man movie.
"Jan 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"We thought that we were watching this movie, but we weren't. WE LIKED THE ANTS."
"Jan 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie is beautyful and there is no big problem with CGI. The real bad thing about this movie is the story itself and all the spectation around the villian. This movie was supposed to introduce Kang into the MCU movie scenario, but it failed as the character is really bad developed. All this ""Quantum World"" is worst executed than any ""Spy kids"" movie (which was pretty weird, by the way). Overall, the movie is fails to develop memorable characters and a well told story."
"Jan 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I had difficulties to stay focused when watching this film. The pacing of the film is off somehow, with very long, oddly placed dialogs. The fighting scenes were not that bad, but sometimes hard to follow.
Some characters were unnecessary, like Krylar, whose only purpose was Bill Murray appearing in the MCU. Kang was awful as a villain, he's just boring. He looks like a boring Rick coming off the citadel of Ricks. That's a huge weak point for the film. Darren was gross most of the time, although he had a few good lines. Besides that, I didn't like all the Star Wars inspired costumes, it didn't fit in the MCU. I think the quantum realm could have been so much more interesting if it was less like just another world similar to ours.
All that said, I did enjoy some parts of the film. Cassie's development and the evolution of the relationship with her dad was compelling. Some characters had interesting designs, like Veb or Xolum. That's also the case for the flying cell-shapes creatures or the living houses.
It's probably my least favorite film from the Multiverse Saga so far."

"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"SPOILER ALERT: üêú ...come on guys, seriously?!"
"Jan 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not worth it. I was excited to see this movie, but the entire movie seemed rushed and not at all exciting. There was no strong message conveyed, and the villain wasn't as big of an issue as he seemed to be. The movie itself was more about Ant Man fixing things with his daughter, but even that wasn't very interesting. The ending was even worse. Right when you think it's going to end on a cliffhanger with them stuck in the quantum realm, Cassie just opens up a portal and they leave happily ever after. While I was excited for the first time Kang would be a villain in the MCU, this movie did not contribute to greatly to it."
"Jan 13, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I liked the other Ant-Man movies a lot but this one was just okay.
The reason for it is Kang. After seeing Thanos as the ultimate supervillian, Kang looks like an excact copy which don't make me excited at all for the upcoming Marvel films.
To see Bill Murray was by the way such a good suprise honestly."
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Muy buena la pel√≠cula la recomiendo

"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,Excelente pel√≠cula me gusta la acci√≥n
"Jan 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Ummm‚Ä¶. Good-ish?? It's one of the most mediocre movies of the MCU which hurts because of how great it could've been. Kang is a great villain and Paul Rudd still steals the show as Ant-Man, But the writing, acting, and CGI all feel off for some reason with some decisions made feeling very wrong. Disappointing but good enough."
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Above all, 'Quantumania' lives for and for adventure, something that had been lost in previous films of the Marvel Universe, it is colorful, original, different and it corrects the mistakes that Marvel has made during these three years of experimentation. an excellent movie to enjoy with whoever you love most üëå‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was great, I recommend it."
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Es muy buena pel√≠cula de verdad la recomiendo tiene buena calidad siempre te mantiene atento a que va a pasar muy buenas grabaciones en realidad muy buena la verdad vayan a verla

"Jan 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I know this movie is recieving a lot of backlash, but uncoincidentally and unmistakably, this is my favorite ant-man movie out of the three."
"Jan 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The last scene was great, missed opportunity to not connect the microverse to the MCU more. The castaways in the microverse were not very entertaining and there didn't really seem to be anything at stake in the storyline, felt too campy."
"Jan 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. Unfortunately, this deeper dive into the MCU Multiverse Saga fell kinda flat. If I had to point any fingers I would say this primarily lands in the lap of the writers. Ultimately, it didn't feel like there was anything new here. Never once did I feel the stakes were great, especially considering the weight they had placed on the main villain Kang's shoulders. And aside from some fairly decent performances from Jonathan Majors (oof!) and Paul Rudd, the film was plagued with logical plot holes, character motivations and actions felt confused and at times forced. Likewise, the feeling of blandness also extended to the dialogue as well. If I were to describe the dialogue, I would say they played it safe. I found myself on several occasions being able to predict exactly what a character was about to say before they said it. Sadly, this felt like a missed opportunity."
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Una pel√≠cula muy interesante, muy entretenida,  tiene muy buenos efectos, una historia muy linda, de mucha aventura y que nos hacen sentir dentro de la historia."
"Jan 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,I did not enjoy this at all. Antman was not even the main character in his own movie and his daughter was insufferable. Jonathan Majors was the best part of this movie...
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"I'd avoided this one since I'd heard a lot of negative reviews, but after watching it, I found it fun. Not quite as good as Ant-Man 1  or 2, but still a good fun movie that hints at larger plans without only being setup."

"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was a big step down from the other Antman movies the real highlights were Veb and Kang. It felt rushed and not complete.
"Jan 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This film is a good time, even though the hype for this film ruins the spot to me. Seeing Scott, Hope, Janet, and Hank on another adventure is such a blast, great visuals, most of the humor works, Cassie is a great addition to the MCU, and Kang is a menace. Issues are that Kang is not as powerful as he should be, and the hype on how amazing this movie should be brings it down. But it is still a good film to watch and have a great time in the quantum realm"
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Lacking in plot, relatability, solid jokes, action sequences. Not sure this movie needed to be made."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,"La pel√≠cula me parece m√°s o menos siento que pudieron quitar algunas escenas y la pel√≠cula seguir√≠a igual, en algunas partes te aburres, pero hubo 2 cosas que me gustaron los villanos kang y modok, aunque lo pudieron aprovechar mejor a este √∫ltimo y la batalla contra el imperio de kang. Por esas razones le doy un 7.8 no la recomiendo tanto."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,This film had a great premise of going to the Quantum realm and exploring an undiscovered world.  It just didn't hit on all cylinders.  Also personally not a fan of King.
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Certainly not the best addition to the mcu or ant man, it answered a few questions like why orange slices but not much else. Probably won't watch again."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,I felt very embarrassed watching this film. Literally. Marvel what are you doing???
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a fan of the first two Ant-man movies, this was very disappointing for me. It was kind of shocking as I walked in assuming it would at least be as fun as the first two. I like how it began, and I love all the cast. For me, they stayed too long in one particular location too long, making it most of the movie instead of just one act of the movie, which, personally I felt it should‚Äôve been. The villain was well acted, but not presented to be the threat that supposedly is supposed to end up being."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Tudo nesse filme me fez ficar com um sono que s√≥ senhor Jesus na causa, nada me cativa, os personagens s√£o cansados e a hist√≥ria √© FRACA."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Probably one of, if not the WORST movies I've ever seen. The CGI is terrible, the jokes are corny, and the villain looks like the bad-guy from Shark Boy and Lava Girl"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This has to be one of the most overhated films of this year, it wasn't that bad, sure there are moments that aren't good, but still this was a great movie & I enjoyed the whole thing"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastical, imaginative, and funny!  There are those that are a bit down on this movie, which I really don't understand.
Give it a shot, I think you'll enjoy it!"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,An absurd and uncanny Marvel movie packed with poor CGI and a weak and nonsensical antagonist.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was just kind of okay until Johnathon Majors is brought into the fold. Everything about the set pieces in this movie feel very small (no pun intended) and nothing really feels real, like it's clear it's on a set, which I don't know is a problem of direction or the use of the volume. As far as performances go either most of the cast were phoning it in or Johnathon Majors is so good that he made everyone else look bad. The story itself I actually don't have too much issue with and overall I enjoyed the film, I think it's just a matter of wasted potential. Maybe if the film was longer they could've fleshed things out more? I'm not sure"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"üáÆüáπ Un film godibile che ha l'arduo‚Ä®compito di risollevare il Marvel Cinematic Universe dopo una Fase 4 leggermente sottotono. Esso riesce nel suo intento e lo fa attraverso un ritmo graduale, portandosi per√≤ dietro anche quella comicit√† alla Marvel ma forse pi√π ""spinta"", considerando che √® un film di Antman. La regia √® buona anche se devo sottolineare qualche sbavatura nella CGI che si conferma di medio livello ma che sicuramente poteva essere eseguita in maniera migliore ( in alcuni tratti insufficiente) anche se non influisce negativamente sulla pellicola. Note di merito a Jonathan Majors che interpreta alla perfezione il personaggio di Kang, comunicando la sua cattiveria in maniera perfetta (gli calza a pennello). Micheal Douglas sempre molto attento e bravo, cos√¨ come Paul Rudd che sa essere serio quando c'√® bisogno di essere serio ed insieme a tutto il cast riesce quindi a far trasparire la bellezza del film che attraverso un ritmo in crescendo arriva ad un gran finale che apre le porte alla Saga del Multiverso, facendola entrare nel vivo. Colonna sonora buona e godibile cos√¨ come la fotografia, montaggio da rivedere: sembra che alcuni pezzi del film importanti siano stati completamente scartati. Il personaggio di Modok √® realizzato in maniera ridicola ma comprendo la volont√† di casa Marvel della caratterizzazione che ha proprio quello scopo. Nel complesso un ottimo film che riaccende l'hype della saga.¬†‚Ä®
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-‚Ä®
üá¨üáß A enjoyable movie that has the arduous task of reviting the Marvel Cinematic Universe after a slightly subdued Phase 4. It succeeds in its intent and does it through a gradual pace, but also carrying with it that Marvel comedy but perhaps more ‚Äòpush', considering that it is an Antman film. The direction is good even if I must emphasize some deburring in the CGI that is confirmed of medium level but that certainly could be performed in a better way (in some traits insufficient) even if it does not negatively affect the film. Notes of merit to Jonathan Majors who perfectly plays Kang's character, communicating his wickedness in a perfect way (he perfectly fits him). Micheal Douglas always very attentive and good, as well as Paul Rudd who knows how to be serious when there is a need to be serious and together with the whole cast then manages to shine through the beauty of the film that through a growing rhythm arrives at a great ending that opens the doors to the Saga of the Multiverse, making it enter the live. Good and enjoyable soundtrack as well as editing and photography. The character of Modok is made in a ridiculous way but I understand the Marvel house will of characterization that has just that purpose. Overall a great movie that rekindles the hype of the saga."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"i had to pause every 10 minutes from how much my cringe organ was dying, but at least the plot was good"
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,was good man need more of it
"Dec 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Went in with pretty low expectations since I caught wind of the RT score upon release, but honestly it's not as bad as critics would like you to believe it to be.
I didn't love it, but I certainly didn't hate it either. I enjoyed it probably just a little less than Shang Chi and that somehow got a huge general approval because of I don't know, Asian representation and generational trauma.

The story would've been better if they drove home it's core themes of ""helping others, even when it's not your problem"" or Scott's personal narrative of ""where do you go from fighting Thanos and saving the universe?""

It felt like it touched on these ideas frequently but never let them resonate with any of the plot points as much as they could have.

Now talking about the elephant in the room, an apparent overuse of CGI. That I think would've been less jarring if many shots weren't downright amateurishly finalized by the SFX team. Like some of the early establishing shots looked like it was done by a filter on someone's smart phone!

Quantumania isn't bad but it's barely good. Relative to Marvel's massive established library I can understand everyone's disappointment. Still, if you want a fun big super hero block buster or are interested in the setup for the next Avengers villain I think this is worth the time.

PS. Darren is actually the best part of the film."
"Dec 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Underrated, better than Iron Man 2"
"Dec 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,It giving: nothing. Nothing at all
"Dec 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's not the best MARVEL movie, but it's good."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"The hate this film gets is not fair, major upgrade over the second film in the ant man saga and paints the picture for the future of the MCU. Good supporting characters and everyone got there chance to shine, but didn't take anything away from Scott. There are curse words throughout this movie though, which Disney has surprised me pleasantly there"
"Nov 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The Ant-Man films have always been a fun, easy going section of the MCU. When all the madness is ensuing in other corners, Ant-Man is still hanging around, having a zany adventure. Here, at the start of Phase 5, Ant-Man and the Wasp defend the MCU, through the Quantum Realm. Like the rest, this installation of Ant-Man does a great job of having fun, creating emotional familial bonds, and doing fun and creative things with size. Taking place almost completely in the Quantum Realm, we see a lot of incredible visual, but also some lackluster CGI as well. It's no secret that this movie was edited last minute to make changes to its climax and I believe that is where this suffers the most. Kang was a phenomenal and truly menacing villain, but it takes away from that when he loses completely and the heroes immediately go back to everyday life. I can't help but feel that a better version of this film sits on the cutting room floor and will never see the light of day. Unfortunately, that is par for the course of some modern comic book flicks as editing has become the most nefarious villain of all."
"Nov 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"ChatGTP could not have written such vomit, how did this script get approved? It's a crime against humanity that a cent was even spent on such a vile story as this. It has the worst lines in the history of humanity, and even worst plot."
"Nov 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring. When bro fanboys say they want an ""unwoke"" super hero movie this is what you get. Some random action scenes bound together with a little faux science dialogue. They literally go somewhere called Subatomica or something. I mean, come on."
"Nov 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Entertaining for sure, with Jonathan Major's Kang being its true highlight. The movie fits the Ant-man narrative tonally, but could have been even more tuned with the other two if it wasn't for the fact that it was chosen to introduce ""the next avangers-level manace""."
"Nov 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ever hear the saying throw some things at the wall and hope something sticks?  Well that's what this movie is except nothing sticks.  Just a mixed up bag of gobbledygook, the premise of which calls into question the point of any film in the MCU.  Bad concept and a bad idea to make this film.  I did like the Bill Murray cameo but that was about it.

Hands down for me the worst film in the MCU.  I haven't seen the Eternals or the Marvels though so keep that in mind :)"
"Nov 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not funny, not entertain, horrible characters"
"Nov 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the CGI and Paul Rudd, the surprise cameos were fun, and it moved the pieces along where they need to be for the rest of MCU Phase 5"
"Nov 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Here is the worst film produced by Marvel, if Ant-Man and the Wasp was bad, Quantumania was even worse, The film that should have presented a villain as good as Kang fails brutally, Kang is a bad villain and the film doesn't convince that the villain is really that threatening or intimidating, he talks and talks and does nothing, in addition to other super generic things played in the film, the wasp shouldn't even be in the title as it wouldn't make any difference, the cgi is a JOKE! Modok is easily Marvel's worst villain, This film doesn't seem to be from the same universe as Avengers: Infinity War, it deserves a 2/10. "
"Nov 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Paul Rudd does a fantastic job once again as Ant-Man, and the introduction of Kang the Conqueror is done fantastically. The ending of the movie leaves you wondering about the stability of the Marvel Universe as a whole and wanting to see more from Jonathan Majors as Kang."
"Nov 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,this movie is not good but it's not bad plus the plot is just all over the place ok I know Marvel movies have been mediocre these days just don't watch this movie 5/10
"Nov 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"One of Marvels best flicks with their best villain ever and the funniest lines in all of MCU. Paul Rudd is fantastic in this role and he doesn't disappoint. Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas are supreme and deliver on stage. The chemistry between Paul Rudd and his daughter is fantastic and you finally get to see them fight together. The villain is honestly Marvels best villain EVER. Jonathan Majors KILLS IT in this role as Kang the conqueror. Finally a villain with a motivation beyond ""I just want to kill 1/2 the people"" someone you can really sympathize with and Majors delivers. There are some weak points to the plot, but they do a good job of giving you little hints along the way to foreshadow the ending. If you're willing to pause disbelief, enough to believe people can become the size of ants, you should be able to pause disbelief enough to believe the plot in this movie. I personally loved every second and have seen it dozens of times now."
"Nov 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this movie, it was definitely unique and different but also a breath of fresh air. "
"Nov 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Sadly another sub-par MCU movie.  I like Paul Rudd & Ant-Man but he can't save this from the weak story, lacklustre characterization & poor villian, There was simply nothing to care about."
"Nov 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"poor acting, to much humor"
"Nov 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great performances and funny moments.
"Nov 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Cool concept, poor execution. Majors' performance was a definite highlight."
"Nov 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang was great but he got defeated by ants. There's to many joke that aren't even funny. Bad CGI and recasting Cassie was the stupidest decision ever made.
"Nov 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Tacky and disorienting CGI. Convoluted storyline.
Rudd is good.
Kang is awful!!! Also the actor playing him is like a cartoon and very hammy."
"Nov 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Was quite good. Plot was ok . Generally fine.
"Nov 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad movie, bad plot, bad writing..."
"Nov 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,Marvel just nerfed Kang‚Äôs exiled variant in this movie
"Nov 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad bad bad bad. Nothing else but jumbled plot, a teenager who is always right and a lead who is constantly dunked on."
"Nov 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ant man 1 & 2 dealt with earthly problems by shrinking and growing themselves and objects. Quantumania didn't really feel like an Ant-Man movie.
"Nov 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,O melhor filme da linha de her√≥is de 2023.
"Nov 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely not as bad as people say, but not the greatest marvel movie either."
"Nov 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The only good thing about this movie is seeing more of Kang.

To be honest, I feel like I wasted 2hr of my time."
"Nov 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie actually made me believe that Marvel hated me. Bad plot, bad character development, stupid ants. 
I would much rather have my fianc√©e cheat on me than have to sit through the pain that was this movie. 
Some good is I liked the characters and I apologize cuz the ants were probably the best part of the movie. I just feel like cute ants don't make up for the years of therapy I will need to get this horrific movie out of my head."
"Nov 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really fun with great character dynamics.  Loved the Kang & Janet scenes.  Hank, Scott & family also have some fantastic character building going on."
"Nov 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not nearly as horrible as people say.  It wasn't amazing either but definitely watchable
"Nov 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I hate myself for dissing a Marvel film - but jeepers this was poor. I feel like they should add the SPOTLIGHT disclaimer to this in post - and try again, especially with M.O.D.O.K who they ruined.

Ant-man deserved a way better film than this. 

If the film hadn't spent all its time in the CGI dungeon, and actually brought the fight back to the surface, unleashing KANG early in the story..... that would have been amazing."
"Nov 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,All I liked was Kang
"Nov 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good overall, not great. Wish it had been a little more impactful. Wish it had a bit more of the street level charms from the first Antman movies."
"Nov 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I hate this movie, everything about this is wrong"
"Nov 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was beyond disappointing. I loved the first film so much, I enjoyed the simple story it told and loved the fun tone. But they had to keep making the stakes higher and higher, and now here we are. Antman isn't doing heists with his crew of friends, he's fighting multiversal conquers in space! (Basically)

I miss the crew he had, I miss the fun of seeing Antman doing stuff in the real world. I miss when everything wasn't setting up for something later."
"Nov 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is a fine movie, there are some elements that failed though. the CGI for example, bad acting with Ant Man's daughter, the misuse of the script's convenience for certain aspects such as a good villain being defeated so easily by ants, unnecessary dialogue, ridiculing Modok and being able to take him out. more benefit. But in general it is an entertaining film, Majors plays a great role: the villain had space within the plot to develop and projected great potential. Within the CGI flaws, there are moments of good special effects and it does not feel like heavy material to digest."
"Nov 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thought it was a great way for the multiverse/kang/quantum realm and answered a few questions. 

Awesome to watch and easy to follow"
"Nov 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's not the best movie and it take a bit to do something interesting
"Nov 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is an excellent addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and does not deserves all the hate it has received.

A standout element of Ant Man and The Wasp: quantummania was the CGI. The special effects were truly impressive, and the action scenes were visually stunning. The use of shrinking and growing technology was cleverly executed, and it was amazing to see it brought to life on the big screen. And as a huge fan of m.o.d.o.k i am amazed of how quirky and badass he is in the film.

Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to any Marvel fan or anyone looking for an entertaining and action-packed film. With a great cast, decent CGI, and a heartwarming family theme, Ant Man and The Wasp: quantummania is a definite must-see!"
"Nov 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Best mcu movie of 2023
"Nov 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The third movie in the Ant-Man series isn't as good, 77-80%"
"Nov 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Kang is the best part about this movie. his present is just so menacing and you fear just watching him. the problem is, whenever it cuts to the silly character of MODOK, the fear is gone and turns into a joke. but can't wait to see more of Kang. 7.5/10"
"Nov 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I would like to review Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but there's no time! Don't you see? We just don't have the time to talk about this movie! I'll review it when I can, I swear! That's basically what Ant-Man 3 feels like. A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end. Paul Rudd is likeable, as usual, and the filmmakers are swinging for the fences with the visual effects, but the story just comes up short."
"Oct 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,the wig on michelle pfifers head was so dry lmao they should fix that in the sequel
"Oct 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania is a fall from greatness from marvel, uninteresting characters and poor storytelling leaves a lot to be desired. Great acting performances and chaotic CGI warfare is one good takeaway from the movie."
"Oct 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Surely not the best Marvel but fun to watch
"Oct 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Less good than the first 2, the worst MCU movie imo"
"Oct 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely stunning huzzah fest of a film! I love ants so this film was a must see for me! Every time those ants appeared I had a courageous little hurrah to myself, as I eagerly sat waiting for more ants to arrive on screen like a starving french peasant eagerly awaiting the next rich noble to fall at the hands of the guillotine. I was a little unsettled at the textured cheeks of the little angry forehead man that appeared on screen during the film, but then more ants were shown and I was astounded once more! ""Hip Hip, Hooray!"" I say, ""Bring more of these ants!"" And brought they were.  I must've counted at least three ants that were brought for my viewing pleasure, and pleasure I sure felt as the ants went flying across the screen! I was captivated by the ants in this movie, transfixed, even. Did I do a small jig to myself as a celebration of these marvelous ants of the film? I dare say I did! The last act of the film was a bit slow, with man turning big in order to fight the prison his daughter was held captive in, and I found myself slowly entangled by dreams as their night vines took hold of me. I almost fell right to dreamland as the wizard used his mind powers to punch man, but then Micheal Douglas appeared with ants! I was shocked and taken in by the wonderful sights I beheld before me: the ants have taken the wizard! HURRAH!! It was a sight too beautiful to behold, these amazing ants, these courageous beings of destiny, that I simply could not sit Idly by. I ejected from my seating area and immediately started praying, running up and down the stairs of the AMC, thanking the ants for all they have done to fulfill my purpose in life. I instantly felt my self gravitate upwards, my soul taken by enlightenment as the ant voices came to me and whispered sweet nothings into my ear. They grabbed ahold of my corporal form and brought it to meet them, bathing my body in golden light as they made their presence known. They told me that I had done well, and then told me the secrets of the universe. I could see Michael Douglass smiling down upon me as he opened his mouth, millions of ants being shot out at 250 mph as he showered me with ants, and in that moment I felt both true happiness, and sadness at knowing I could never experience this again. Lowering me back into that AMC, I waited for the marvel post credit scene and then walked out, feeling a sense of pride, and a sense of accomplishment at the actions of this movie, and the actions of ants everywhere. There is no true joy, there is no true love, there is only ant.
Rating: 4 and a half stars, overall pretty good!"
"Oct 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Completely uninspired.
"Oct 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Tbh people overthink things to much 100% great watch, marvellous acting funny it's ant man worthy Kang is an awesome villain! Whole family enjoyed it I mean it's not out of this world but it's great to pass the time any day of the week, it's heartwarming and comfy!!"
"Oct 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The quantum realm looks like they filmed a swampy puddle and then cgi‚Äôd paul rudd in it. this film has a budget of $200m; where did that go?
"Oct 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is terrible and not worth your time.
"Oct 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,No science was involved in this.So much potential to tell the story with the quantum realm.The story of itself was rubbish.
"Oct 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"OMG, how terrible was that... And why oh why have they cast Jonathan Majors in the MCU. He is so incredibly annoying. His performance made me cringe. 

It felt as if the supposed attempt at humour was forced. 
The storyline is predictable. The GFX however is stunning.

My advice, spend your precious time on something else."
"Oct 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie deserves way more credit than its getting. Great cast, great storyline, pretty much practically perfect in every way!"
"Oct 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie. Kang was awesome and Rudd for me hardly ever disappoints. It's fun with lots of brill action and visuals of the quantum realm. Nice introduction to how dangerous Kang variants will be. One Kang was very powerful. A multiversal amount! No idea how that will go. Looking forward to more. I've watched it 3 times already as I personally love the movie
"Oct 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Sooooo we just stopped trying????  A plot that revolves around smart people being dumb and nobody communicating.  Lets not mention that there is an entire civilization in the quantum realm.  The toughest battles and insurmountable odds can be overcome by socialism via deus ex Machina.
"Oct 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,I expected more. Marvel slipped
"Oct 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolute garbage. Writers smoking DYUCK
"Oct 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's very difficult to set up a Thanos-level antagonist by setting him against Ant-Man. The first two Ant-man movies were not bad. They were fun, low-stakes hero movies featuring a loveable protagonist in Scott Lang (Paul Rudd).  This movie attempts to do too much, especially with this character. In Infinity war, the movie sets up Thanos as a larger than life antagonist by showing how easily he can beat the hulk one on one. For this new antagonist to go against Ant-man and even have the battle be close kind of just diminishes his threat level.  Apart from that, the plot makes little sense without several contrivances. Also, almost all of the movie has unrealistic green-screen backgrounds to the point where it just doesn't even feel like there's anything tangible to ground the story. Overall, the movie just doesn't hit the mark for what it was trying to do."
"Oct 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marking the beginning of Marvel Studios' Phase V, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania aims to end the Ant-Man trilogy on a high note while formally introducing us to new Avengers antagonist Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors.

This is, without a doubt, one of Marvel's most ambitious projects to date as most of it is set not in a parallel dimension or even in space but in the equally vast Quantum Realm: a very tiny universe where pretty much anything could exist or happen. And a lot of it does here. The creativity involved in bringing this fantasy world to life is genuinely impressive as it delivers the right amount of flashy, surreal visuals and bizarre characters. Director Peyton Reed understood that this Quantum Realm had to feel like nothing else in the MCU and his mission is somewhat accomplished.

Unfortunately, this universe has the bad luck of feeling rather similar to the ""space between universes"" we saw recently in Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness, especially since it also involves a bunch of confused actors running on treadmills in front of green screens, which appears to be the norm now over at Marvel headquarters. They throw a bit of wind in there, to make it feel like something, but these are hollow, textureless places you never believe for one second.

This third Ant-Man movie is a perfect example of everything that's charming yet also disappointing about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For all the inventive stuff you see in this film, there's just as many things that take you out of the experience entirely. The cast, for one, mostly seems lost in this wild and wacky story. Framing the film in a tongue-in-cheek way with Paul Rudd's hero flat-out claiming his life ""makes no sense"", thereby warning you about what's to come, was a good move as it assures us that the film is in on the joke. However, the tonal shifts throughout the film both underlines its comedic framing and clumsily bumps headfirst against it.

Paul Rudd, when he's given a chance to let loose and troll the film a little bit, looks like he's having a great time. But as Ant-Man he is criminally bland. Rudd ends up feeling miscast as a character that badly needed to be fleshed-out since his first film but wasn't. I want to like and ""get"" Scott Lang but he is such a void that all I end up seeing is a very uncomfortable Paul Rudd who wishes he was literally anywhere else but is doing his best regardless. In fact, everyone in this film does try very hard, I'll give them credit. As Lang's daughter Cassie, Kathryn Newton has a big role and, despite the often dire lines she's given to work with, she tries to deliver each of them with the earnestness and energy needed. Same goes for Jonathan Majors.

Majors clearly worked hard on trying to give this bad guy role a bit more weight and eccentricity - something to make Marvel's frankly odd investment in the character feel worthwhile. Yet even his genuine efforts can't make Kang interesting or intimidating in any way. The villain finds himself desperately clawing at every scene he's in in the hope of moving or shocking the audience in some way but he is completely overshadowed by the hilariously misguided yet captivating M.O.D.O.K. (a returning Corey Stoll) who makes his live-action debut here. Obviously, this was always going to be a tough character to make happen convincingly in a film like this but, even though his design is ugly as sin and nowhere near as creepy and repulsive as he could/should have been, he remains a lot of fun and the effect is impossible to look at without smiling. 

Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas seem tragically baffled in this movie as their main contribution involves a lot of exposition spouting and pretending to look around at their green screen surroundings like they're seeing something truly amazing or walking through an Alice In Wonderland-style forest. Everyone's reaction to M.O.D.O.K. is priceless, however, so they at least nailed this part! Oh, and the less said about Bill Murray's awkward cameo the better - though, admittedly, his exit from the movie is funny.

And, really, that's what saves Quantumania: it's funny. A lot of the time on purpose, a lot of the time accidentally. But, you know, sometimes funny is just... funny. And I'll take that over this movie's horrible attempts at conveying real emotions and tackling serious themes while there's a dude with a BROCCOLI HEAD just walking around saying stuff. There's that tone shift again! This is, to be completely honest, one of the most ludicrous films ever made and, for that reason, you gotta watch it. The visuals are a trip, the mess of it all is a beautiful trainwreck, yet it's also actually good sometimes: the ""drink the ooze"" sequence is worthy of a Rick & Morty episode, crossed with something Taika Waititi would come up with (which might annoy some viewers further, granted).

Like I said: you gotta watch this movie. It set out to be an unapologetically wild experience and it definitely is that. Part-Star Wars spoof, part-Fantastic Voyage, there's still heist stuff in there somehow, the Baskin Robbins guy is back, characters multiply like cells... it is relentlessly ridiculous, occasionally awful/brilliant and, though some will hate it with a passion, some will no doubt appreciate its refusal to make any sense at all for the sake of pure, brainless entertainment.

A really fun bit of weirdness."
"Oct 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Um‚Ä¶ I'm confused. I loved the cute aliens and stuff, but why is Ant-Man running like he's equipped a Roblox animation pack? The effects‚Ä¶ I was disappointed to say the least. Kang was cool, and I loved the opening scene, but as the film progressed I got a bit bored if I'm honest."
"Oct 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst film in the Ant man series by miles. An utter disappointment. On top of that the new actress they picked to play Cassie is extremely annoying and irritating. I liked the first two movies and did not expect Quantumania would be this BAD.
"Oct 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Having re-watched the first two movies before this, it only made this all the more disappointing. Trying to hard with the Quantum Realm and the creatures within it, this just fails."
"Oct 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The overall movie was good, except, the CGI on Modoc was bad. I didn't like how kang was defeated by ants. But overall, I still liked the movie."
"Oct 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I enjoyed the movie. I also give Disney high marks for making the wokest movies like ever. The prolific use of black men is inspiring. George Floyd's passing did so much good for the 13% of this country by forcing every commercial enterprise to hire more black artists, actors‚Ä¶..to appease that angry population. The only drawback is the forcing of blacks into every movie, commercial, tv show, every everything‚Ä¶ Asians and Hispanics won't receive the same opportunities. Will Hispanics or Asians get their own marvel movie like the black panther and that spin off‚Ä¶called Rowanda or something. Heck no! Not until the hispanics and Asians loot, burn cities and perpetuate other violent murderous crimes will they get their own marvel movies and be included in every single commercial during NFL, NBA, MLb games. Just saying."
"Oct 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst MCUs. The film just seemed like a bunch of CGI segments stitched together. There was almost no plot, no story line, no character development. The acting was extremely poor, highlighted by Michael Douglas doing his Wall Street personality. Kang is a low-rent Thanos. 

If it wasn't for the saving grace of the funny character Darren (Cory Stoll) and an end scene with ants, it would have been 1 star."
"Oct 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kept me bored in theater, gets better when you watch it a second time. Good movie, I just feel it lost some of the Ant-Man charm from the other movies. Pretty good performances."
"Oct 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,Sin duda Marvel tiene un problema para llevar el multiverso y a kang. Aunque la pel√≠cula es entretenida y con buenas actuaciones ( Jonathan mayors carrilea xd y) si modok no estuviera me ayudar√≠a a dormir mejor.
"Oct 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""This film was by far one of the weakest in the MCU. The performances were bland and tired. The story was repetitive and the effects didn't look very good.  A true dud."""
"Oct 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Very underrated. I don't understand any of the hate. I thought this was an amazing way to start off phase 5! Kang killed it!
"Oct 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought Jonathan Majors was the real star of the movie.
while the CGI wasn't that good the story was pretty good and I found myself enjoying Kang a lot.
I like to see this movie more as Kangs introduction and his story for the rest of the MCU and the continuation for the Multiverse Saga"
"Oct 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst Marvel movie by far. Waste of money watching it in theatres..
"Oct 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually pleasing and the story isn't COMPLETELY bad but everything about this movie is forgettable.  Over used humor that takes away from moments but some passable attempts.  Very little rhyme or reason to events other than to move the plot, forced humor, and pretty thin plot overall make this movie watchable but nothing to write home about."
"Sep 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I will start off by saying this movie is not as bad as the ""critics"" are making it seem. But I do see where their criticisms are coming from. The entire first act I was not on board with but the build up to Kang was beautiful. Overall this movie is fine"
"Sep 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Only good part is kang.
"Sep 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"absolute flop! Flipping hated this movie. even Bill Murray was wasted. the villian was laughing incompetent, and the character all made so many stupid decisions it was hard to watch. just another sign of Marvels fallen kingdom

oh and how could i forget modoc? worst abomination put to screen"
"Sep 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie... is absolute dogtrash. They throw so many things at you and just expect you to understand. Modok is my favorite Marvel Villans and he was done so dirty in this film... I would give it one star, but the CGI is pretty solid and better than most MCU films nowadays."
"Sep 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania had the chance for marvel to do something right but it fell on its face. The acting (outside of Majors) sucks and I don't have hope for the MCU going forward
"Sep 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Greatest Marvel movie ever 

Jonathan mayors
Paul rudd"
"Sep 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie provides an artist's dream, with the VFX artists having a field day to build the expansive world that is the quantum realm. That, however, is pretty much the only good thing about this film."
"Sep 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was okay... Standard Marvel Movie...
"Sep 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The opening feels completely detached from the 2nd movie's cliffhanger ending. My mom compared it to Avatar, Star Wars, & Close Encounters. The tone of the movie is condescending & childish like it is mad at grade schoolers."
"Sep 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,First of all: I love marvel but this was a shitshow. The only funny thing was the alien Veb.
"Sep 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a thrill ride with cool visiuals and a chilling villain
"Sep 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The Bad: CGI isn't great, acting can be off, they ruined the formula of a Hero losing something in their 3rd movie and no high Stakes and some jokes didn't land plus Evangeline Lily's Wasp and Michael Douglas' Hank Van Pym had No Purpose 

The Good: Very Fun, Jonathan Majors' Performance was outstanding, I'm a MODOK defender, Kathryn Newton was a Better Recast for Cassie Lang and its a good Setup for Phase 5 and Loki Season 2 and Avengers: The Kang Dynasty"
"Sep 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,How do people like this movie. The visuals were just meh (which is great by modern marvel movie standards) and the story seemed haphazardly put together. The only good thing about this was Kang and the way he was defeated was just goofy and out of place. The writing made me laugh at it not with it and it was just so forgettable.
"Sep 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,this movie is kinda trash the grandma girl was so stupid and nasty! i kinda wish i had not watched  this because my life would be ten times better. the one thing i could say i like is the after  credits scene with loki but that was just advertising season 2 of his show. i wish his dumb daughter wasnt dumb the guy who had holes was suppose to be funny i think but he was kinda dumb too. ant man and the wasp quantamania would be better if it was sonic mania.
"Sep 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,It feels like the whole movie was generated in ChatGPT and it's rough‚Ä¶
"Sep 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked that it was a family adventure (something the MCU hadn't tried yet). I liked the participation of Cassie and the other protagonists; except Hank Pym, who did little. The Quantum Realm looked desperately like a Star Wars planet. Despite being exaggerated, the look was interesting. What I thought made the film boring was the villain. Unlike Thanos, Kang has no charisma or a controversial cause, which makes him just an annoying guy that no one wants to see in another film."
"Sep 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sometimes I think critics are trying to make a point rather than really rate a movie.  critics are fed up with the MCU and are saying it is old, stale, etc.  

Well I thought it was one of the best MCU movies.  It was fast, interesting, with some humor, heroes acting as heroes, an interesting villain. and very good action."
"Sep 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,This one was a messy one.  Poor plot CGI overdone and lots of poor acting.  Don't waste your time.
"Sep 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"its the worst movie i have seen, ever"
"Sep 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,Antman Quantumania is an enjoyable movie with some clunky plot points. The highlight is Jonathan Majors as Kang. With a honorable mention for is Kathryn Newton as the new Cassie.
"Sep 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No. Wrong setting and too much CGI. Kang is annoying , hope they don't bring him back. Acting mostly ok. Storyline is weak."
"Sep 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this movie is great and really underrated. Not only does it include a great main villain, but it also includes the ultimate weapon!!"
"Sep 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Disappointing, green-screened to an inch of its life mess. Really missed Michael Pena + David Daschmalsian."
"Sep 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You could tell they had a much better script. They left the remains of some of it throughout the film. Such a dishonour to the previous Ant man films. There were little to no stakes for the ant family, and tell me why it took a whole hour for Kang to appear. Kang kept talking about how Scott could have had ""more time with his daughter"" as if this was a completely different plot deleted recklessly. 
Kang's motivations made no sense, cause he could have let the ant family leave and then left himself. Instead he got beat by the ant family. How is this the same film from the official trailer?"
"Sep 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Although visually stunning it was definitely one of the worst marvel movies. I love the actors and think they did a good job but the movie played too much into the weird aspect and didn't feel like a genuine marvel movie. It dumbs down the characters, promotes people into buying a book that doesn't have to exist beyond screens, and feels like a huge cash grab."
"Sep 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Nothing that will surprise you at this point, but a very adequate piece of entertainment.  Major is a presence."
"Sep 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"i do understand why people didn't like this movie, but i've seen worse! i mean the plot was flaky, some characters were useless and it was overall weird, but at the same time it stablished some important points regarding the future of the mcu. starting with the positives: we explore more about the quantum realm, realizing that there's a whole civilization down there and they're actually at war; we also learn about janet's time there and the connections she made; kang is a main character and key part of the storyline, ilustrating more deeply his purpose and story from what we saw on loki season one; we get some fun and action-packed moments from the film in general, as well as father-daughter bonding from scott and cassie! now the negatives (hold on): the special effects were not that cool as previous marvel work; that man with the big face was weird; HOPE WAS FUCKING USELESS!!!; we get introduced to cassie as the next generation, but it's not in a direct or stablished way aka not as good as other new character introductions (america chavez); the people down there literally don't have another purpose apart from rebellion, which is fair, but dull; the whole interactions between the pym/van dyne family was weird AF and, as i said, the whole movie moved at a slow pace and, although epic at times, it felt oh so plain. definitely the worst of the ant-man franchise. it promised a lot and didn't deliver as expected, so i think that's another factor that influenced my opinion of it all. i really wish there is more of these characters, specially hope, because she needs a redemption. at the end of the day the ants saved them all and that was cool, not going to lie. i'm eager to see where and what kang does next, as the main villain of the multiverse saga, and how he disrupts peace in the multiverse. scott always was and will probably always be an entertaining and amazing main character to watch, so in my opinion, he saved the movie in his own way. going to end reminding myself that even though it wasn't what i expected, in the negative way, i had a great time watching it and after all it's a marvel movie so the formula was clear from the start. really hope this characters have a better future in general. and i guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens with the future of the multiverse ;)"
"Sep 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man is great at humor, the weight is on his back, Kang is the support of the film. Average film to open phase five of the Marvel universe"
"Sep 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,For how bad some people say it is it‚Äôs not that bad it might be my favorite ant man movie 
"Sep 2, 2023",POSITIVE,No entiendo porque a la gente no le gusta esta pel√≠cula (le dar√≠a 4 estrellas pero se merece 5)
"Sep 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun movie with MUCH better (and cooler) action than Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3. Sadly, Kang was a bit of a flop compared to how hyped up he was. He's a decent villain in the movie, but his short fight scenes/brief final little fight...it doesn't match his own talk in the movie about killing countless Avengers in other timelines, lol. The literal seconds of footage of him killing/blowing things up in the flashbacks of him conquering worlds just wasn't enough. They should've spent more time showing him dominating planets/armies to give the audience a real sense of how powerful he was. Oh well. Besides that issue and how annoying the daughter Cassie was, it was a very entertaining movie."
"Sep 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Has Marvel succeeded in anything since Endgame? Nah, but this one was okay."
"Sep 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The third entry in the Ant-Man trilogy gave me an experience which I never felt before and I need to share it.
 
This film was just awful in every way possible. I was so disappointed by this film. The writing is so poor and the first act was terrible. Ant-Man films are enjoyable and funny but this film was boring and unfunny. This film had some interesting ideas but it felt like screenwriter Jeff Loveness didn't know what to do with it.

 The performances were so dull in this film. Michele Pfeiper had something to do in this film finally but that wasn't interesting either, I don't know what Evangalene Lilly and Michael Douglas did. The actress who played Cassie felt monotonous  but worst of all even Paul Rudd didn't offer anything worthwhile which was so disheartening to witness because he is the reason I watched this film and I hope they give these actors some better scenes in the future. The Bill Murray cameo made me want to just say ""why?""

This film has the same problems as every film in phase 4 had. It felt rushed, terrible first acts and being a long post credit scene instead of acting as a stand-alone film. Due to these problems marvel is leaving its fans disappointed and dissatisfied.it's high time that Marvel noticed these problems and worked on them. 

How do you get disappointed, I mean extremely disappointed by something despite having no expectations? This film is the answer to that."
"Sep 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,disney screwed up another franchise movie
"Aug 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good! One of my favourite Marvel Movies!
"Aug 30, 2023",POSITIVE,It is really good I didn't like how Hank wasn't showed on screen a lot and Hope's Haircut. But that's the only gripe Kang carries and Ant Man is funny yet awesome as usualüòÅ
"Aug 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In my opinion, this is better than The Flash, but it's still a bad movie."
"Aug 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not bad but definitely not close to other Marvel movies
"Aug 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania - 5.5/10. Okay, Marvel. Please stop making movies every 3 months. Its diluting your market, quality, and just the excitement for your movies. This is an unnecessary movie in my opinion. Is it horrible? No. But was it really needed? Outside of introducing Kang and showing the Quantum world, this was just not needed to be honest. Everyone is fine in their roles mind you, but yeah, I just didn't feel that entertained throughout the film. And surprisingly, there's a lot of suggestive humour here. Kevin Fiege, space your movies out and only make movies if you really need to!"
"Aug 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The humor is admittedly cheesier than previous Antman movies, but I found Quantumania to be a light hilarious experience. Kang is an imposing villian, and the only part of the story that can be taken seriously. And I'm weirdly okay with that."
"Aug 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked the concept fir this movie, I enjoyed most if it. Bill Murray was an unexpected pleasure. But I found my attention wandering.  It's a fun movie, just the same."
"Aug 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Di√°logos fracos, p√©ssimo roteiro onde fundamentos que j√° haviam sido estabelecidos s√£o subvertidos ao bel prazer da ocasi√£o. O humor que em outras produ√ß√µes da Marvel esteve presente em doses cavalares, aqui, temos s√≥ uma pitadinha, com piadas repetitivas e sem tempo. Encerrando devo dizer que a experi√™ncia em assisti-lo deixou-me um retro gosto amargo desta trama rasa com um personagem interessante em participa√ß√µes em outras obras, mas que n√£o merecia estar em seu terceiro filme."
"Aug 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel at its absolute worst. A poorly written plot with forced and out of place  political quips. The villain is the movie's sole saving grace. But unfortunately not enough to make this worth watching.
"Aug 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring plot and terrible CGI saved by Jonathon Majors performance as Kang. The M.O.D.O.K subplot is ruined by weak character development. Very disappointed
"Aug 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Why do they keep wasting great villains in bad films. My god is the MCU hit or miss these days. It baffles me how bad Marvel Studios CGI is sometimes. Please give the VFX teams more time to work on these movies ffs. I used to get mad when people said these movies are made for kids, but now I see their point. Guess we dont have to worry about Kang if THAT was the most dangerous one. Congratulations on making the supposed next Thanos the least scary villain of all."
"Aug 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is my favorite Ant-man movie so far. It definitely took notes from Star Wars and created a fanatical world full of strange scenery and weird characters. This was an adventure movie in an unknown, creative world which is EXACTLY what movies SHOULD be. So of course, we finally get something good and people destroy it so we stop getting anything good in the future. 

I had fun with this movie and I am not a HUGE Marvel fan. I just like them enough to check them out. But this was one of the funnest ones I have seen so I do not get the critic hate for it. I guess hating new Marvel movies is just the new trendy thing to do and they would have hated it regardless of it's qualities. 

The only con for me, which is what critics loved the most, is Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang. He seemed to not know what caliber of movie he was in. It felt like he was trying to go for an Oscar inside of popcorn movie. He did odd facial movements trying to convey uniqueness when it just came off as bad-timing. He was thinking too hard and trying too hard. It felt forced and not natural. I really wish someone else was cast as Kang, especially seeing as he is the new ""Thanos"" in the upcoming Avengers movies."
"Aug 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,We felt like the writer couldn't decide between a comedy or a knockoff of Star Wars. It was drawn out and boring. Darren in the movie was just plain dumb. I can't believe the actors even agreed to being in this flop!
"Aug 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worth renting but not buying or paying for a theater ticket.
"Aug 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"La verdad, me parece una pelicula entre lo decente y lo mediocre, es algo aburrida y su CGI es malo en algunas escenas, pero pienso que pudo estar mejor"
"Aug 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst film I've ever seen
"Aug 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Everything happens so slow. Is 

boring and it has simple story."
"Aug 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"THE ENDING WAS SOMEWHAT PREDICTABLE, YET VERY ENTERTAINING. I THINK I WOULD'VE PREFERRED THE ORIGINAL CASSIE ACTRESS TO HAD DONE THAT ROLE THOUGH."
"Aug 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Completely ruined ant man
"Aug 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This makes makes you want to see what happens next in the multiverse
"Aug 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was pretty generic, but Kang was really cool."
"Aug 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was okay but got boring as there was zero storyline. Just a load of CGI and loud music. Another conveyor belt film from some studio.
"Aug 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie because I‚Äôm a huge fan of marvel studios movies in general 
"Aug 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Poor start and doesn't recover
"Aug 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"CGI of Modok could have been better, but overall was another good addition to the MCU"
"Aug 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I looked at other reviews it made me rank this project higher, this movie was one of the best installments of Marvel phase 4 in my opinion. This movie has been criticized even though It was a very pleasant experience watching this movie. This is not a fantastic movie comparing it to other Marvel media, but as a movie it is quite good."
"Aug 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This one was quite good actually. Marvel is quite a bit of hit and miss lately. It all depends on whether one of the woke retards has gotten their grubby hands on the script or not.

It was of course encouraging that the woke ""critics"" on the well known rubbish site Rotten Tomatoes declared it rotten while it got a 82% score from the actual audience. Always a good sign for a movie.

The movie is a pure adventure movie meant to entertain the audience. The script is decent and, as usual with a Marvel movie, serves mainly to create a reason for doing action sequences and lots and lots of special effects.

The adventure is mixed in with some humor but it is generally okay and not overdone.

The scenery in the quantum world is fantastic and the creatures are great ranging from terrifying to quite fun. Bringing in Bill Murray was a nice surprise even though he was a bit of a bad guy and quite short lived.

The one character I really didn't like was Paul Rudd as the Ant-Man. His anti-hero bullshit, reluctance to fight and generally being a douche until he was forced to actually do what was right was really grating on me.

Overall though this was some well spent two hours."
"Aug 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another disappointing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that had very promising performances and themes. Unfortunately, this visually bloated film was messy and unbalanced with its humour, dark tones and poorly executed writing."
"Aug 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filled to the brim with plot holes and unnatural, misplaced humour."
"Aug 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"√â bem ruim. Mesmo. Homem Formiga nunca foi bom, mas esse √© t√£o ruim quanto Thor Amor e Trov√£o. Tem nada s√©rio nisso, voc√™ n√£o consegue levar um √∫nico momento a s√©rio que j√° vem piada ruim. O Kang foi a melhor coisa do filme todo.

"Aug 11, 2023",POSITIVE,An exciting journey with loved characters
"Aug 9, 2023",POSITIVE,love the setting how antman and the wasp transform into insects
"Aug 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you follow all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and want to be in the know of where the franchise is going, then you'll get a tiny bit from Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. The final post-credits stingers at the end of the film have the biggest connections to Phase 5 and afterward, but everything else is shallow at best. Although the movie is not terrible, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is definitely not on the higher end of Marvel films you'll see."
"Aug 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I had a wonderful time watching this in theaters. The seats were filled and the laughter was surmountable and that feel-good excitement that Marvel/Disney know how to harness was in the air. My theater was very pleased with this movie experience. My only critique is that it tried much too hard with some of its jokes also not thrilled about 3 separate instances of recasting his daughter. Really takes away from the emotion I could have felt for her and their relationship.
"Aug 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"That was cheesy movie
Predicted in every second
And kang and the robot guy was awfull"
"Aug 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Michel Pfeifer put in her all and the CGI is quite good (for a Marvel film), but ""Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania"" struggles to keep up to the hype of the previous two films and fails on almost every level to entertain."
"Aug 7, 2023",POSITIVE,better then the 2nd ant-man and i loved the kang stuff all these variants i get it
"Aug 6, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie it's definitely over hated. The problems I have with it are small compared to the good time I had watching it.
"Aug 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was so disappointing. It had none of the charm of the first two Antmans and I had to turn it off after about 30 minutes because I couldn't stand how cheesy and boring it was.
"Aug 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A ""new"" quantum universe that was a sloppy, lazy version of Dune and Star Wars. What a disappointment! The storyline was really bad and seemed made by AI, characters were superficial (that ""Darren""-head was on a 6-year old pipi-pooh-level) and you don't feel for them not one second. Only the villain did a great job. Rotten!"
"Aug 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Good excellent movie
"Aug 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Whoof. Not even gonna talk about what kind of hell happened here.
"Aug 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,God! But it's no perfect.
"Aug 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I like Paul Rudd but this was pretty disappointing.

Way to much visual affects."
"Aug 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie. Jonathan Majors is a great actor. Don't believe on critic ratings. Watch the movie ones, you won't regret."
"Aug 5, 2023",POSITIVE,An fantastic Ant Man Movie! Kang was Fantastic! Loved exploring the quantum realm! Felt like watching a Star Wars Movie! An amazing final battle! The post credit scenes are insane! Fantastic start for Phase 5 of the MCU and the continuation for the Multiverse Saga!
"Aug 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was pure fun from start to finish.  Great humor, interesting powers, interesting people, and beautiful CGI.  We loved it.  I'm so disappointed to see reviewers being so wrong yet again.  This is a pure fun action movie.  Just have some fun!"
"Aug 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good movie, CGI could‚Äôve been better. MODOK was terrible."
"Aug 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had been putting this off bc I don't really care for Antman, but I knew I needed to see it to keep up with marvel timeline. It was actually the best marvel movie I've seen since.... Endgame? Very funny. Entertaining. Felt like the previous marvel movies. I'm unsure why it has a low score so I came to rate it."
"Aug 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,I really wanted this movie to be good but I just cant pretend the movie isnt dog poop some moments feel really stupid or annoying and the plot is just everywhere like a mess
"Aug 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang alone gives this film its only star.
"Aug 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, bland, predictable. A mess of CGI and wasted talent. Only good part was Kang."
"Aug 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,A bit mediocre to kill kang when he is meant to be the next main villain personally not a great start for his character
"Aug 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Paul Rudd was funny as always but the CGI was really very poor.  Story was alright
"Aug 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ant-Man and the Wasp:Quantumania not very good but also not very bad
"Aug 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Was rooting for Kahn. Only character with some soul. The rest were all douches
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice movie and must watch
"Aug 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania is just another Marvel movie that feels like it's just a big setup for a Marvel movie that I'll come along later, and doesn't focus enough on the actual story. But, overall it's a fun movie to watch with the whole family. Marvel made some choices with the MODOK character, and that might make or break this movie for you. Finally, the final battle better could feel a little underwhelming, and might leave you thinking ""really, this is how they're going to finish it off""."
"Aug 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Some good humor and action.  Nothing too special
"Aug 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was highly OK but if this is what starts the next wave of Marvel movies I got better things to do.
"Aug 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good Movie.  Good visuals.  The ending could have been better, but I enjoyed myself."
"Aug 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Slow decline of Marvel with these recent movie releases.
"Aug 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow, this is bad. Well, maybe little kids will like it. The cast, the acting, the story, all of it is just terrible. This is among the worst of the Marvel movies in my opinion. I think its worse than Dr, Strange Multiverse , Thor: Love and Thunder, Eternals, and Black Widow."
"Jul 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another ""meh, it's fine"". Not as funny as other Ant-Man entries, but Kang is the first GENUINELY good villain we've seen in this franchise so that's something at least"
"Jul 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films and the film medium. In general, film criticism can be divided into two categories: journalistic criticism that appears regularly in newspapers"
"Jul 31, 2023",POSITIVE,it's kinda mid but at least kathryn newton is cute
"Jul 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I seen the trailers (I usually don't watch trailers anymore) I was shocked by how it looked, It looked like a CGI mess of a movie, and I didn't really wanna watch it, luckily I did because it was actually a good movie especially since Marvel hasn't been doing so well for the past 2 years, I was really impressed with the colorful space atmosphere and the beautiful design of the Quantum realm it really fit the vibe of the movie and worked so well! The jokes were actually funny in this movie and I laughed quite a few times. The cons about watching this movie is that it feels like the more recent star wars movies and feels HEAVILY inspired by it. It also feels slightly more dramatic than it should be about Kang, besides that I think this is a great build up for the new phase and I Love what they did with it. The Ant-Man Trilogy was been done swell."
"Jul 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Paul rudd can't be beat
"Jul 29, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the few Marvel post snap projects worth watching.
"Jul 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"what the hell has marvel been doing for the past few years... the decline in quality has been ridiculous, marvel is becoming a joke"
"Jul 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"its horrible. ive never seen anithing like that, just simple."
"Jul 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The MODOK was very bad.
And the plot doesn't make any sense."
"Jul 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The actress who plays the mother of the wasp is the best thing about this movie. She manages to show the danger that the kang is, but the screenwriter shows the opposite when the feared kang loses to ants... sometimes I catch myself thinking how someone at marvel approved a script like that and thought it would be great..."
"Jul 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Incre√≠ble, me qued√© dormido en mitad de pel√≠cula, mucho humo ü•±"
"Jul 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania no llega a alcanzar por ning√∫n segundo a sus predecesores (adem√°s de ser la √∫nica plana de la trilog√≠a), pero la decente emoci√≥n que carga es la que la deja estable."
"Jul 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this was a great family film, just as the two previous Ant-Man movies were. Although I did miss Luis and his classic 'recaps', the story itself did not lend itself to having him involved on this one.

In particular, I enjoyed seeing some of what Janet had gone through during her time in the quantum-realm, and encountering another version of Kang who had been 'imprisoned' there by his fellow Kangs. And while some complained he was not nearly as powerful or terrifying as he was supposed to be, I simply thought that if someone is going to be put in a 'prison' you aren't going to let them keep ALL their usual equipment and resources. He was allowed to keep his ship because it was needed to send him to the prison in the first place. Yet Kang still proved to be quite formidable since he was almost starting from scratch and had to build a new army with things he could find there, which was quite an impressive feat. And defeating him, was not simple. Scott needed help and it took more than just him to stop Kang, who is probably still out there somewhere.

As for MODOK, I went back to the first Ant-Man and when we last saw Darren, he was being distorted and wound up with a large head and tiny limbs just before vanishing, so his becoming a version of MODOK worked. In fact, I felt this was good continuity through the movies.

Very enjoyable! I definitely recommend it!"
"Jul 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,The other two ant man movies were really good but for ant man and the wasp quantumania was ok but it's still not as good as the other two movies.
"Jul 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The green screen and effects really shine through here, in a bad way. You get the feeling this whole movie was shot in a warehouse with everybody in green jumpsuits. Nothing feels real, not the sets, not the clothes, not even some of the characters. I am admittedly not a fan of the ensemble of characters that surround Ant-Man, but I was even less thrilled than usual by their ant-ics. This movie should have poised Kang triumphantly at the debut of the Marvel scene, but instead he limps by as easily the best part of an otherwise joyless film."
"Jul 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love Paul Rudd, but yikes"
"Jul 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not the greatest Marvel film, but not the worst either. Smart, funny, entertaining movie, but the stakes felt lower than they should have. Definitely a good set up for better films moving forward. Exciting mid- and post-credit scenes."
"Jul 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A fairly entertaining installment, which may not be at the level of the infinity saga, but it fulfills its objective. Ant-Man is a character who has not lost his essence and makes a lot of laughs. [spoiler] We got to know Kang the Conqueror and his relationship with the multiverse. I love that they keep going deeper and deeper into the clashes of the multiverse and that at some point it will all culminate in one big multiverse war.[/spoiler]"
"Jul 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania has a little trouble balancing the comedic and dramatic tones of the movie but for the most part does great at making the audience grow to like this new setting and environment. For a movie called, Ant-Man AND the Wasp. There's definitely much more time developing the characters of Scott and Cassie than there is with Janet, Hank, and Hope who feel a bit sidetracked in this movie. Kang conquers this movie as the villain. Jonathan Majors is a pretty chilling in this movie and you really feel how much of a threat he really is. I think the addition of MODOK was great as well but I think the character would've grown on me a bit more if he was less the punchline of a joke and was taken more seriously. Just a small nitpick but I do wish we got more time with the characters from the Quantum Realm but hopefully this won't be the last time seeing them. I also thought some of Kathryn's acting in the movie could have been better, some dialogue feels a tiny bit exaggerated or too dramatic. Overall, Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania is entertaining, has a great story with some lack of character development, but overall just a fun time in a whole shrunked down world. A-"
"Jul 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Prove that Marvel failed again with public praise and box office.
"Jul 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Disappointing, jokes were forced and dumbed down, the Kang character felt spoilt. I fear this the cracks in the future of Marvel films are starting to show."
"Jul 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is the setup for phase 5. Marvel may not be as fire as it used to, but AATW: Quantumania was overall good. It served its purpose to project Kang's narcissism."
"Jul 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pretty bad but better than the video boggos twin
"Jul 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,started out promising enough but descended into idiocy in the last half. It is almost like the movie had two different writers. The final 30 minutes were so bad that it undid some of the better moments at the beginning
"Jul 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie had some great action sequences and Jonathan Majors is fantastic as Kang, but other than that, it really wasn't that good. It was a little too goofy for my taste and was not super emotional. Also, Kang just does not seem as threatening as Thanos..."
"Jul 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Like Jonathan major's couldn't save this film
"Jul 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's a line by line ripoff of Star Wars. The Quantum Realm looks and feels like Tattoine. There's an evil emperor Kang , his killer henchman Modok/Vader who was left for dead by the Jedi/Ant-Man and got resurrected in grotesque form by the emperor. The score sounds exactly like John Williams. There's a cantina at the beginning of the adventure full of aliens. You've got a young Jedi/Ant-Man mentored by an old man Jedi/Ant-Man. You've got a warrior princess Lea/Cassie who is directly related to the young Jedi.

They copied Star Wars. If I were George Lucas, I'd sue."
"Jul 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Far, far better than the critics would have you think. I was off watching it until recently due to the negativity. While this isn't a groundbreaking movie, and you know what you are getting before you watch it, it is family friendly, fun and imaginative. We enjoyed it a lot."
"Jul 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Me personally kang carried the whole movie I don't really like Ant-Man as a character or hero since all he can do is shrink and enlarge stuff but this movie I liked not really good but I like it for Kang and the multiverse saga just not how it closed up his trilogy
"Jul 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Paul really tried his best.
"Jul 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"zu quietsch bunt, lahme Story, lahme verpatzte Slapsticks und wieso hei√üt das im Deutschen nicht Khan sondern K√Ñ√ÑNG, finde zurecht in der Kritik verissen. Irgendwie ist Marvel mit Endgame gestorben"
"Jul 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors was the bright star in the film.
"Jul 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's a waste of time, money, energy.
Don't bother watching."
"Jul 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The villain was good bill Murray was in it for a little which is always nice that's about all I can say was positive. The cgi bad, acting meh, story bad kind of painful to sit through in my opinion."
"Jul 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel has really fallen and can't get up. This is the third Legacy character they've absolutely wasted. In fact, for Doctor Strange, Thor and Ant-Man, they not only wasted great established characters, but excellent casts as well. In this way, they were so upset that they turned Kang, the main villain, into an idiot and it looks like Marvel has no plans to move forward. Not Kiang the Conqueror, but Kang the Idiot.

Ultimately, this movie adds to the uneasiness of the poorly written deceptions that have permeated the MCU since Endgame. With one of the worst third acts of any film in recent history. The use of MODOK and the ""stick"" turn might be the dumbest thing I've ever seen and that's not even a spoiler. He also ended the film as if the budget had run out. What an absolute waste.

Portugu√™s/Brasil:
A Marvel realmente caiu e n√£o consegue se levantar. Este √© o terceiro personagem legado que eles absolutamente desperdi√ßaram. De fato, para Doutor Estranho, Thor e Homem-Formiga, eles n√£o apenas desperdi√ßaram grandes personagens consagrados, mas tamb√©m elencos excelentes. Dessa maneira, foram t√£o alvora√ßados que eles transformaram Kang, o vil√£o principal, em um idiota e parece que a Marvel n√£o tem planos de seguir em frente. N√£o Kiang, o conquistador, mas Kang, o idiota.

Por fim, esse filme aumenta o mal-estar das decep√ß√µes mal escritas que permeiam o MCU desde Endgame. Com um dos piores terceiros atos de qualquer filme da hist√≥ria recente. O uso de MODOK e a virada de ""pau"" podem ser a coisa mais idiota que eu j√° vi e isso nem √© spoiler. Ele tamb√©m encerrou o filme como se o or√ßamento tivesse acabado. Que desperd√≠cio absoluto."
"Jul 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,It‚Äôs alright. The cgi is bad. Some moment in the film were really cringe.
"Jul 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Personally, i quite enjoyed this movie, i've always liked Ant-Man as a character, and the whole idea behind the quantum world. I find the science behind the suits power really interesting as well, and i like the jokes that Ant-Man delivered through-out the movie, made me laugh a few times."
"Jul 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,There's more plot holes in a Swich cheese. The characters are unbelievable stupid.
"Jul 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst Marvel Movie in a weird phase of Marvel
"Jul 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible writing, lame graphics."
"Jul 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was ok. The Modok thing was weird.
"Jul 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,What an absolute mess. The script is uninspired. The acting is mediocre at best and the special effects look childish. It's a bad combination of Avatar meets Jurassic Park meets Star Wars meets the MCU. I'd you think that combo sounds great‚Äîthink again
"Jul 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is not bottom of the barrel Mcu, but it isn't a masterpiece by any means! Jonathan is a great kang, but a good villain can't hold up a messy plot and unfinished cgi. The reshoots for the movie is badly noticed and the main character Ant-man is sidelined for other more boring characters. Overall a decent movie, but not a masterpiece! Miles better than the dumpsterfire that She-Hulk was"
"Jul 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've never wanted or even thought about leaving a movie theater during a movie before I saw this one. 

They brought in new characters that live in the Quantum realm for us to care about and when they killed them they probably expected us to care about them. Instead of killing many characters that we don't know, maybe kill one character that the viewers actually cares about to thicken the plot for the next movie."
"Jul 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it, Not as bad as the critics and toxic fanboys made it out to be."
"Jul 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not the best Marvel movie, not the worst Marvel movie."
"Jul 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good start, but I don't think you should watch a film only for it's post credits scenes."
"Jul 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie, my favorite of the series. I love how it showcases quantum science in a fun way, while having a perfect balance between seriousness and hilarity."
"Jul 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boringgggggg !!!! The Wrost of Marvel
"Jul 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"what happened , ant man , perfect for small capers , why blow him up to word saving .( puns !)"
"Jul 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The creators of ""Quantumania"" caught the far too contagious VFX flu. The world they've created is so colorful and magnificent, like an exaggerated marshmallow dessert.. two bites and you're good. There is little else to see beside Jonathan Majors as Kang and the plot is, well, ok. But the VFX, oh the VFX, so bad. I wish we could go back to the Marvel prior to Guardians of the Galaxy part 2, when the flu reared its ugly head.  

TL;DR Marvel yet again made an all VFX movie with little soul."
"Jul 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Even Bill Murray couldn't save this galactic trash heap. That sounds harsh, but we should expect more from the MCU, even post-Agengers. The writing is subpar and makes for a convoluted story. Despite liking the main trip of characters, you don't feel connected to what is going on. The setting isn't exactly intriguing or interesting, despite being away from Earth. It's like they mashed together Marvel and Star Wars this time around. As great as it sounds, nothing works.

After enjoying the first two films in the series, I came away disappointed in the third outing. Ant-Man certainly deserves better."
"Jul 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Scott Lang is not only a Avenger, but also a successful author of a best selling book. Scott's daughter Cassie is now a teenager and a activists for human rights and a scientist.
    Unknown to Scott, with Hank's guidance, Cassie has created a device that can send signals to the Quantum Realm. As Cassie demonstrates to everyone how it works. Janet panics and tries to shut It off but it's too late. Contact has been made and a portal suddenly opens. Hank, Janet, Cassie, Hope, and Scott are all sucked into the Quantum Realm.
   So, to their surprise there are cities and worlds and there are beings in the Quantum Realm!  Apparently Janet Van Dyne did not tell anyone what really happened for those 30 years she was in the Quantum Realm....  There is also Kang, a exiled traveler. Kang's ship was disabled and Janet had helped rebuild his ship. But when she realized he's actually a villain, a destroyer of worlds, she disabled his ship and left him stranded in the Quantum Realm.
   Kang has now captured Ant-Man and Cassie and he wants his ship back. He makes a deal with Ant-Man. Ant-Man must retrieve the ship's power core in return for Cassie.
    I really like the first two Ant-Man films but this third film is total nonsense. The Quantum beings look like rejects from a Looney Tunes cartoon. Oh and there is also a silly giant floating head.                                       
      The whole movie is just totally beyond ridiculous ....just one big CGI mess
 Cast Paul Rudd - Evangeline Lilly - Jonathan Majors - Michael Douglas - Michelle Pfeiffer"
"Jul 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman Quantumania, is a film that explores another interesting realm in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Jul 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't liked the third Ant Man Movie very much. I think it does not really fit to the character story wise like. Paul Rudd was great as usual and I also think that Kang is a good enemy, but not for an Ant Man movie in my opinion. And I also found the humor not very much appealing this time!"
"Jul 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I loved the first two antman movies but this somewhat didnt quite drag me in the same.

The storyline wasnt great i hope the next antman will be better written.

Overall its worth watching if your a MCU fan its still decent 6/10 seems fair"
"Jul 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Antman supposed to fight and defend anyone who is fighting for their freedom, yet, this movie he is more concern about saving his daughter than help fight the evil ruler. He is not a hero but a selfish man. Give someone else the suit maybe his daughter since she wants to help but antman refuse. Very disappointed. I would not recommend this movie. It is nothing like the other Antman movies."
"Jul 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania was the MCU at its best. With a scene stealing Paul Rudd and amazing villains in Johnathan Majors, Corey Stoll, and especially Bill Murray, the film was just wonderful. The film still had the comedy of the first two and with the stakes high, Quantumania succeeded in two things- Making a great third adventure for Ant Man & co. and preparing the MCU for what's to come with Kang."
"Jul 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Script has so many flaws, acting is ok but the screenwriter/director was 100% high. It started with mystery scene, then peace and then more conflict (this cycle repeats over and over through the entire movie) and at the end the script lead us to the same 1st peaceful scene on the movie.
(Screenplay was like: Mystery -> Peace -> Conflicts -> Peace -> Conflicts -> ... -> ... -> dumb ending scene | Not to mention that Luis never happen to exists on this movie, 100% nonsense)

It's a roller-coaster movie with no conclusions, overcomes or even solutions to the plot -Cassie's was so annoying on this one-. Producers of this film be like: ""Hey, let's make a movie about ant-man that has nothing about ant-man?! Oh my yes!!!"". This movie should've be called ""Kang: Through The Quantumania"" and not Ant-man: Quantumania; They only used this character to introduce Kang and not to tell us another great Ant-man adventure movie."
"Jul 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,what the hell is happening in this movie
"Jul 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Um dos piores filmes da marvel de todos os tempos.
"Jul 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Kang should of dominated everyone in the movie given that he was the ""banished"" one out of all the other kangs and was supposed to be the most evil an ruthless it was silly that ant man stopped him you'd need an infinity gauntlet an even tha wouldnt help against comic accurate Kang they should of made a sole villain movie for Kang instead of a hero movie and introduce the F4 as the reverse antagonists and then have a end credit scene with the skulls introducing secret invasion and all together it just didn't have the same humour as the previous ones I was gutted when it was announced he will be facing kang as I thought they had set the ground work for ant man to be it's own comedy franchise like the guardians shame it became a serious movie as there isn't much comedy in marvel all action an some drama an the odd one liners across all the movies"
"Jul 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Di√°logo infantis e fracos, personagens que n√£o empolgam e a marvel se perdendo entre uma a√ß√£o que poderia ser bem constru√≠da e as piadas que tiram totalmente o peso dos conflitos gerados."
"Jul 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Idk how to even explain how much I hated this
"Jul 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania unfortunately fell a bit flat, which I find falls into the category of Marvel movies that had great actors and potential yet came undone sometime during the writing and production process. I thought the film had quite a few fun concepts, and enjoyed the introduction of the new world. Additionally, I thoroughly enjoyed Jonathan Major's performance, although I feel that the marketing for Quantumania played his role a disservice. 

My biggest qualm is the plot. The movie looks beautiful, but I don't believe the audience and genuinely immerse themselves into the world and its characters if the story doesn't pass the bar. I watched an advanced screening of the movie, and without lying, I can tell you that at parts within the movie a good portion of the audience laughed at plot points that were intended to be tense and dramatic because of how absurd they felt. 

Honestly, like Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness (which I liked, but the plot was also sour), it felt like a movie that was ""eh"" but fans were obligated to watch due to their plot relevance in the multiverse. Overall, I would recommend to watch it, but it wasn't worth the theatre experience."
"Jul 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jonathan Majors performance as Kang carried the entire film.
"Jul 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Best one of the trilogy kang is awesome
"Jul 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While this movie wasn't horrible, it was pretty bad. Would not recommend watching as you're probably better off not wasting your time on this movie."
"Jul 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually? Looks okay.
Story wise? Basically just a warning that Kang is dangerous."
"Jul 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible. The turned one of my favourite characters into a goofy protagonist who doesn't have much screen time or character development. Graphics were great - storyline was chaotic.
"Jul 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman 1 and 2 were my favorite MCU movies if we're not counting the Avengers films. The comedy + heist worked incredibly well in the first two films. This film did feel like it was a mere setup for future big budget films with Kang as the main villain. The recasting of Cassie's character and the lack of Luis were noticeable downfalls of this 3rd Antman film. The storytelling by Luis was sorely missed here. Cassie's character was rather stiff, far away from the funny kid that contributed to the magic of the first 2 movies. Also, the emotional stakes were meant to be high but ultimately, the stakes were low. Other than that, Antman himself was great and Kang was given a solid introduction. If you liked the first two films, it's worth it to see this one, as you learn more about the quantum realm and see Antman's character develop further."
"Jul 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Went away from what Ant-Man does best. Questionable introduction for Kang. More CGI than imaginable. Still funny and would recommend if youre into this sort of thing.
"Jul 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ant-Man 3 was a huge let-down after the first 2 movies were enjoyable and funny. It feels as if it was just a vehicle to introduce Kang again. I am glad that I missed this one in theatres and just caught it on Disney+
"Jul 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Stopped watching after an hour.
"Jul 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"It has its flaws, but this movie is still an amazing new ride to begin a new phase of MCU with its new big bad"
"Jul 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Ant-Man movie so far! The world is great, the characters are fun and interesting, and the story is very exciting to watch!"
"Jul 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is genuinely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Massive waste of time that cannot be regained. I'm not even sure why I continue to give Disney chances with marvel. Their movies and shows are garbage now and actively insult people who have spent time with the brand in the comics.
Hard pass. 
Fire your writers and all leads on marvel. Get people that actually care about the characters and source material."
"Jul 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The truth is that the film is not surprising, very simple ideas and a rather boring villain who keeps many secrets and mysteries; Pretty boring characters and very bad CGI, but good and simple story"
"Jul 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it. It's another super hero movie. Don't expect a huge plot, but it is super entertaining and I loved how they explored the quantum realm. Majors as Kang incredible as I expected, and the rest of the cast did I great job as well."
"Jul 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,It has its moments but it ends up feeling more like a cheap Star Wars movie than anything.
"Jul 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I finally got around to seeing this latest installment of the Ant-man franchise, I went in with low expectations. Why? Bad Reviews, and word of mouth, there was very little buzz (pun intended) around the film. I checked it out, and safe to say, I enjoyed it. All the main players do a fantastic job, and thank you Disney (or whoever), for giving Pfeiffer some much needed screen time. The (discarded) mystery behind Janet's absence was finally revisited, and were given a substantial backstory that makes sense (in this universe at least). Not sure what will happen going forward, but I for one highly recommend this one over even the last installment."
"Jul 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"totally forgettable, some lines are so bad"
"Jul 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Really disappointing, boring, and juvenile movie. Terrible introduction to Kang as well. Marvel is dead."
"Jul 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"In general, this movie is somewhat enjoyable. Kang in my opinion is a very dull villain in this movie and possibly the MCU's future projects."
"Jul 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Knowing all it had to do for the MCU storyline this is a great entry even if it's not perfect. It holds on to Ant Man's original qualities while putting his story on a higher scale with greater stakes. Don't understand the critical hate.
"Jul 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is the best Ant-man movie, Ant-mans annoying friends aren't in this one so that's a plus. The cgi was okay, story was somewhat easy to follow but I personally think Ant-man should've died in the movie."
"Jul 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is mind-blowing; I enjoyed it a lot mainly because of its amazing CGI. But, the acting is stunning and the script is hilarious. This film definitely held my attention from start to end.

The storyline follows a man/superhero named Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), whose daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) creates a device that can send messages to the Quantum Realm. After a signal is sent a portal appears, and they all get sucked in -- Scott and Cassie along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglass), Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). They explore the Quantum Realm and try to find a way out.


I really enjoyed this film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is really amazing, particularly since I am a huge MCU / Marvel fan. One thing that caught my attention is the CGI which is very realistic. The sets, the aliens, and even the Quantum ships all look so real. Another thing that really pops out is the acting, which is amazing. For instance, when one of them gets hurt it looks real, because the actors bring that to life. When someone uses their powers that also looks very realistic. For example, when Kang does his energy blast it looks so real. Also, when Scott and Cassie transform and change sizes throughout the movie that is excellent. The humorous dialogue really is one of the best parts. I particularly enjoyed the part when Scott doesn't know what the Quantum people are saying; his reaction is hilarious. I laughed almost throughout the whole film. Another thing I really like is the cinematography. I just love how when something explodes the camera shakes along with it; that made me feel as if I was there in the scene. 

The film's lesson is an inspiring reminder that, just because something isn't happening to you, it doesn't mean it's not happening. I relate to this because I find that people will ignore your problems, but when the same thing happens to them they start to understand how you felt. Be aware that it does contain some gore, weaponry and foul language.

I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 5 out of 5 stars and I recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. By Gavin S., KIDS FIRST!"
"Jul 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm in between the critics and the audience, I'll give it a 70%. 3 stars for the special effects, 0 stars for everything else. The acting and dialog are corny, the story is nothing new. It's worth watching, but not very memorable."
"Jul 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very lack luster Kang was the only bright spot in the movie the scenes that Kang wasn't in dragged this movie had a big problem with too many characters in a lead role position which left a lot of characters just there with nothing to do slim to none funny moments but a couple good laughs rate 5.5/10
"Jul 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,The acting in this film was so bad and the story was just boring and wasn't creative.
"Jul 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"WARNING REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!

This is some quantumid.

I was looking foward to this film so much. One of my most anticipated movies of the year. It was going to set up ""Avengers: The Kang Dynasty"" and ""Avengers: Secret Wars"". Instead what I got was a mediocre film that doesn't know what the fuck it wants to be. Is it a comedy? A drama? a Multiverse movie? Who the fuck knows because it feels like bits of those ideas were trying to squeeze in but those genre's couldn't mix. And the ending, Jesus fucking Christ what a co pout. The original ending was really good with Hank and Janet being stuck in the Quantum Realm, trying to rebuilt what Kang destroyed, which I already didn't like that Kang dies in the end. But that could be excused for a dramatic cliffhanger ending. BUT THEN THEY CHANGED IT FOR SOME FUCKING REASON! To be a happy-go-lucky ending where it feels like the ending of a fucking Illumination movie. To be honest, the ending is what made me so bitter through this review. But there are redeeming factors. It's a Marvel film at the end of the day so you do get an entertaining third act which was easily the best part of the movie. But the CGI man, just stop overworking them because M.O.D.O.K. looked like Mr. Electric from Sharkboy and Lavagirl. M.O.D.O.K.'s baby ass cheeks will haunt me forever.

FINAL GRADE: C+"
"Jul 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was actually much better than I expected. Pure eye candy. I like my Marvel movies very silly and cool to look at. The end.  Some of the jokes here were a little flat, but definitely more than a few chuckles and a few lols. I wouldn't watch it twice but the one time I watched it I had a great time."
"Jul 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was pretty good but too much Jonathan Majors' Kang, it ended badly on multiple levels. More attention to other characters and little less cheese would have been nice. Disney and Kevin F'up are killing the Marvel franchise."
"Jul 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel's take on Shark Boy and Lava Girl. Minus the camp.
"Jul 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Direct to video disaster.  Putting Paul Rudd in this movie is like using the Hope Diamond as a door-stop.  Sure it works, but what a waste."
"Jul 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You know that feeling when you don't wipe your booty properly after a dump and it's kinda itchy, that's this movie"
"Jul 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The plot was jumbled and some decisions for the film were questionable, but Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was an okay time and left me wanting more of Kang even with the possibility of Jonathan Majors getting recasted."
"Jul 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolute mess this film. I don't truly understand the plot of this film. Other than disastrous writing, Quantumania has problem in putting camera for some scene. it shows by how on some of the scenes the characters and the background doesn't blend well. Also Kathryn Newton's performance was horrible, I can't see her act in this film."
"Jul 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Disjointed plot, clunky CGI moments, and excessive run time make this the worst installment in the Antman series. Dad humor and an interesting new villain make this film passable."
"Jul 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Gotta love Paul Rudd, and one scene appearance of Bill Murray."
"Jul 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A very bad movie with terrible special effects, direction, and screenplay. The only good thing about it is Jonatan Majors' performance."
"Jul 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall fun, but graphics could have been much better. I wish Ant-man would have had more to do in the movie. The daughter was annoying. Mordok was also a bit ridiculous and not good either visually or as a character. Generally good for a one-time view."
"Jul 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Estremamente esquec√≠vel, o Kang n√£o nos passa medo em momento algum porque voc√™ sabe que nada ir√° acontecer aos personagens. O filme em si tamb√©m parece muito rushado, tudo acontece muito r√°pido e sem profundidade, pelo menos √© divertido para passar o tempo, o filme poderia ter 1h30m que j√° seria o bastante.
O ator do Kang ajudou o vil√£o a parecer mais forte, tem um grande carisma, mas ele n√£o parece uma amea√ßa t√£o grande quanto o Thanos, at√© porque, como caralhos o HOMEM FORMIGA SOZINHO ""derrotou"" o pr√≥ximo grande vil√£o da Marvel? N√£o faz sentido, mas enfim filme esquec√≠vel e bem furado."
"Jun 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,I enjoy this movie more than most people but still good
"Jun 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this film. Kang is a fantastic villain, and I can't wait to see more of him. I think the sense of actual danger and urgency is a great change for the Ant Man trilogy, and the characters all rose to the challenges and became better versions of themselves. I think this was a great start to phase 5."
"Jun 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Lazy marvel movie, waste jonathan majors good acting."
"Jun 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"this movie was probably written by an 8 year old with a childish plot, it literally ruins the plot for the whole MCU because Kang is supposed to win in order to because the ruler of the multiverse, not lose. it is also not really an ""ant man"". overall the plot was just childish and it just wouldve been better if it followed what the directors did the first time"
"Jun 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,I watched this on a long flight and helped pass the time. Paul Rudd excellent and Jonathan majors was great but it just wasn't anywhere near as good as the first two films. It served as setting up Kang ‚Ä¶ so worth watching for the post credits scene if anything.
"Jun 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I read the critics reviews before watching so decided not to go in expecting too much.

I was pleasantly surprised. Didn't take itself too seriously, the effects are epic and we also managed to get a further glimpse of Marvels next big bad in Kang.

Best of the bunch since Endgame!"
"Jun 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Kinda a mess but it passed the time. Original was better and really Kang was boring and kinda silly. That said, growing up I also saw Kang as really kinda silly and the time trips not very creatively done. Especially with the slicing and dicing of time lines and multiverses we have now that are much more interesting then ones done back in the day. 
Rudd, was great. Lilly was just stupid as usual. Other characters were okay. Again, worth watching on Disney+ as long as you don't expect much with it being kinda like a sci-fi drama in a fishbowl."
"Jun 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie üçø better than the last one. A must see
"Jun 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jonathan Majors' portrayal of Kang was captivating, but unfortunately, the screenplay writers made a foolish decision by hastily killing him off in the wrong way. It's an absolute insult to Kang, who is far superior to Thanos. Kang had so many other intriguing goals, but he was introduced poorly, like a worthless character, and there was a grave mistake in replacing Emma Fuhrmann with the new actress for Cassie Lang, who delivered a stiff and lifeless performance.

I'm disappointed with the MCU for hiring scriptwriters like this who seem to treat everything as a joke and disregard the comics and canon of Phase 4. Perhaps the fault lies in having overly high expectations."
"Jun 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great watchable film I liked it, but the only bad thing is too much screen time for the character of the daughter, which should be used instead on Ant-Man. Overall, the film is great to get invested in as its sets up future films ."
"Jun 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very disappointed not funny enough disgraceful to modok overall a horrible film none of the fun characters were hear either but kang was good but that's it
"Jun 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie had potential but it's just a CGI mess. There is lots of fun elements with a great villain, some very funny jokes and a pretty epic soundtrack. But sadly this movie is mostly just look at this CGI OK now time for some good stuff and then more CGI and some good stuff after and it's just dumb because there is a lot of good stuff i. there like some of the MCU comedy out there, and one of my favorite MCU villains and a great soundtrack but the movie is mostly this stupid MCU showing off they have money crap and while there was a lot of enjoyable stuff here I still can't give it a good rating but I'm still gonna be nice to it because there was a lot of good stuff too like the soundtrack and villains and jokes but sadly it still can't get a great score. C+."
"Jun 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Movie is just all around wack. From acting to Cinematography , everything just felt off."
"Jun 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I found it good there were some disappointments. I wasn't upset as much, but the humor wasn't that funny I found it cringed but I loved the film It's a go watch with friends."
"Jun 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,too much information to take in - but very fun to watch.
"Jun 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Needs more Cassie action
"Jun 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ill start by saying: The visual effects were pretty cool!
But thats where the good ends pretty much...
The stury was pretty boring with all of the common situation... it was too much predictable. 
There was also too many moments where it didnt make sense, almost as if some moments or actions were missing. 
The music was ok.
I hope this was helpful!"
"Jun 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The new AntMan movie has good main characters, interesting antagonist, and boring ass side characters. Although at the end with the ants was awesome. Plot is decent but it drags out for 2 hours when it only needed about 1 and a half. The comedy is good. Now what do we call the daughter? The dragonfly?"
"Jun 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Pretty good. Not a lot to say.
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite making me think of a Star Wars movie, this film is my favorite of the Ant-Man trilogy. Scott is so funny without making it sound stupid and forced. Very good story. Just wish there was a little showing what has happened in Cassie‚Äôs life following the Snap. Can‚Äôt wait for more Kang!"
"Jun 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's not so bad.
There are some plot holes the green screen is bad and they got wrong the setting.
The only thing that save this movie is it's amazing diversity in the quantum realm"
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. Don't listen to the negative reviews, if you still love Marvel, you'll love it."
"Jun 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not the MCU's best outing but still plenty of fun to be had.
"Jun 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a notable movie that had its holes, but it did show a good showing. By the way, this could have been prevented if people had common sense."
"Jun 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst movie I have ever seen
"Jun 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,They overdid it this time
"Jun 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Yikes. I wanted to like it, but the story was all over the place and the movie was a mess."
"Jun 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's tremendously exciting and I couldn't help but be wowed many times. The tension between the protagonist and antagonist is also tremendous, due to great acting. I also applaud the coloring, music and special effects.
It does seem likely that a full-circle line is fueled by testosterone."
"Jun 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Without question the worst movie I've ever seen. Just ridiculous in every way.
"Jun 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I dont expect much from marvel movies, but this wasnt even close hitting the marvel benchmark. Real yikes."
"Jun 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Verily, this movie embarked upon its journey with resounding strength and promise. Its initial moments captivated my senses and filled me with anticipation. However, alas, as the tale unfolded, a sense of disarray emerged, as if no guiding hand steered its course. The once-clear direction became muddled, leaving me adrift in a sea of confusion. It seemed as though no one held the helm, directing this story towards its intended destination. Thus, despite its strong beginning, this movie suffered from a lack of cohesive direction, leaving me longing for a guiding presence to navigate its narrative waters."
"Jun 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know how people don't like a movie because, to be honest, the movie is so amazing"
"Jun 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Why would there be people who are not people? Why would quantum realm look like  Pandora from Wish? Why would someone call Bill Murray in the movie for no reason dinner? Can someone just delete this from existence???
"Jun 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Way too kiddish for anyone older than 12. It's no wonder the studio didn't break even with this one. Marvel can do a lot better. Especially with a 200 million budget!
"Jun 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Worth seeing to really get to the beginning of this new and long Marvel story. Kan is just amazing.
"Jun 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Taking into account that this film has to be judged within a general framework of the MCU, I really liked it and the setting is truly incredible."
"Jun 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Es una pel√≠cula gen√©rica solo para pasar el rato. Pienso que pudo ser mejor para lo que se ven√≠a abriendo en esta nueva fase. No fue mala pel√≠cula solo fue una m√°s de Ant-man y a pesar de que los dem√°s actores salen sobrando Scott Lang y el villano hacen la diferencia y entretienen el momento. Desafortunadamente hay exageraci√≥n del CGI y en ocasiones te pierdes en los planos. Fuera de ello es pasable y disfrutable para una tarde en el sof√°.
"Jun 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great start to phase 5! I can't wait to see how this intriguing story continues.
"Jun 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a slow start to Phase 5, It needs better CGI and writing, hopefully they improve Ant-Man movies in the future. 

Enjoyment: 5/10
Overall: 6/10"
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not Afraid To Take Big Swings Despite Losing Some of The Core Ingredients That Made This Part of The Heroverse Unique, Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania is A Fun Addition To The MCU That Rockily Sets The Stage For What Is To Come."
"Jun 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I feel like this movie is a bit over hated. Sure there's some parts where you could possibly tell there's a green screen behind and some cheesy dialogue, but it's a fun movie especially the parts with Kang are fantastic. I think he's my new favorite marvel villain."
"Jun 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don't like Ant-Man anymore.
"Jun 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film made me almost give up on marvel. This film is insanely bad, how did they get from 2 great films to 1 insanely bad film. The only reason I did not give up on marvel because I liked some parts. So please, don't watch."
"Jun 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,I realy liked the MCU a lot and watched every movey and series. What happened to them can't they make good movies anymore for real why must there be a giant head. Who pitched this idea to the producer. The movie made me create a account on the site just to write an bad review!
"Jun 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,I expected something much better for being a movie that showed Kang as the villain of this saga.
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is so God damn bad, worse than the second one, that I came here and made an account just to say how God damn horrible it is."
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wow - didn't think it would be THIS bad!  Literally unwatchable.  It's too bad Disney Marvel makes such bad movies now when only a few years ago they made good ones.
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie wasn't as good as the 1st 2 movies. It's watchable but I think it lacks a good climax and it's just not Marvel to evolve backwards. I would rather watch She-Hulk than this(not saying it's bad tho). I love Ant-Man but this is just not Ant-Man. What really angers me is... WHAT HAPPENED TO MODOK! They took one of Marvel's best Villains and killed them at the same movie... Whelp, I guess we're not getting a Gwenpool movie in the MCU."
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible Movie, bad movie. Sorry"
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was less about the titular characters, and more about everyone else. Kinda seems a little confusing if you expect to watch a movie about Ant-Man and the Wasp and get hardly any Ant-Man and barely any Wasp."
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie wasn't great, I had to turn it off after about 30 minutes.

The whole plot felt dumb and unbelievable. It's just another Marvel movie being churned out with no real care for quality or substance. Nothing enjoyable about it."
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it but didn‚Äôt need more Pfeiffer
"Jun 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was an average Marvel film. Not great, but not terrible. It could have been so much more, and that is probably where a lot of frustration/disappointment toward it is coming from. But it was just average"
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang very easy to defeat
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,The most boring movie I have seen this year so far.
"Jun 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Cursed by its own hype, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania veers too far from the close-to-the-ground heroes that made the first entries so enjoyable, but great performances across the board make it a worthwhile watch for those who can overlook under-built world building along the way."
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't let the critics fool you, Quantumania is a great movie. We hype every Marvel project up way too much these days, they're not all going to be GOTG 3 or Avengers Endgame. There were a few things I thought could've been done differently and/or better, but in the end, the movie works by itself and as part of the bigger picture."
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" delivers another dose of hilarious action and mind-bending adventures. The dynamic duo, Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, captivate with their chemistry, while the movie's quantum realm exploration keeps you on the edge of your seat. Marvel magic at its finest!"
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was just too much overkill! 
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A LSD trip for your eyes, (In the worst possible context) characters that either are overshadowed or just purposeless, and Ant-Man no longer being central interest, Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania is a rocky and unlevelled beginning to phase 5, with Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors) being an interesting and menacing villain, that aims to direct the MCU in a new and invigorating direction. (Even if Kang isn't the best villain ever made.)"
"Jun 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A lot of harsh reviews. I will try to be fair. The film isn't a 0, but it's not a 10 either. I think it's a fair 6.

I am a big fan of Ant-Man, and I like most of the MCU content generally. This here is a decent MCU film, a great new expansion of Ant-Man lore, and the introduction (or re-introduction) of an exciting new character.

That being said, I found some parts of the story to be more difficult to digest. Janet works hard to justify herself in how she never bothered to tell everyone about ""The Conqueror"". And the Conqueror himself sure explains a lot about his multiversal conflict. This is of course the MCU talking to us, the audience, through this film. But i find this sort of thing more and more obvious, and it makes the film feel less like an Ant-Man film, and more about a ""what you need to know about"" film. It's like the movie is retconning itself sometimes. This is nothing new for recent MCU content, they do that more and more. But for an Ant-Man film, it's a bit disappointing.

The movie is also set 95% in the Quantum Realm, where almost everything is CGI. To me it looked great, but I won't argue against someone with the opposite opinion. CGI landscapes can feel grand, just like they can feel empty. They can look fake, or beautiful. Sometimes it's both.

I am also a fan of Modok, generally speaking. I liked seeing this version of him in the film, and I enjoyed the explanation behind it. But I feel like it's a bit of a waste. The movie would be the same without him, basically.

I felt a bit confused at the end of the film however. Perhaps i was a bit tired, but near the end I felt like i had missed a scene and suddenly it was ending. I don't want to give too many spoilers, so I cannot say too much"
"Jun 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another forgettable Marvel entry. These movies are like Starbucks. There are much better options out there, but you know what you will get and at least it‚Äôs quick. "
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly this is easily my favorite out of the series. Still funny as normal but there's a lot more action and cool looking stuff in this movie. Really good movie.
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Paul Rudd was in this movie
"Jun 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Weird. That's a good word to describe it.
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Yeah, CGI was okey, plot kinda meh. Its not touching me. Kang on the begining was cool, powerfull antagonist, but on the end... Wasted potential."
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nothing more but an okay movie. Ant-Mans abilitys just don't really work in a world, where everyone is √ºber small. Plus some plot holes, like Kang needs him to ""steal"" the power core, to allude to Scotts past as a criminal. But then he doesn't steal, just shrink it. This is a Kang introduction, not an Ant-Man movie."
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was terrible! 
"Jun 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun! Good family pic!
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm kind of getting tired of the MCU's constant stream of quantity over quality and this film is just another example of that problem slowly getting worse and worse. It's probably the most visually interesting of the trilogy only because it has more colors than the first two films combined. He actual visuals and cinematography aren't great though. Everything here feels very unmotivated and bland. It doesn't feel like there is a purpose to any of the shots and they are just going through a checklist of basic shots to get for the scene without feeling creative or interesting. The visuals effects range from okay to just bad. Clearly they didn't spend enough time on them and it really shows here because almost every shot has a lot of visual effects work done on them. There is no sense of size or space in these shots especially towards the end where Cassie Lang is over 10 times the size of MODOK but you really couldn't tell if you just watched the clip and not the whole scene. The story is kind of interesting? They definitely had a really solid first draft that just needed a little more work done but instead of doing that, they just took that first draft and ran with it so a lot of ideas and concepts feel underdeveloped and uninteresting. This could have been solved with a rewrite or two but clearly Feige and them don't care about actually doing that work. Most of the performances are good. Paul Rudd is still doing a great job and Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas are good as well. Jonathan Majors did a great job as well but with everything that came out after this film came out, the less said the better. Shame that he screwed up his career just as he was taking off. Bill Murray was kind of awful though here but thankfully his scene is short. Kang as the villain was the best part of the film. He was fun and engaging and his plan was interesting but his final scene is awful. For an all powerful being, he goes out really poorly. The humor is all over the place. Sometimes it's funny and sometimes it's unbearably unfunny. There really isn't a whole lot here to like but it's mostly just boring and not bad like Thor 4 and Black Widow. You can honestly probably skip this one unless you really wanna see Kang."
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst marvel movie of all time.
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie turned away from the light hearted approach first two Ant Man- creating a very bad CGI world of actors clearly acting on a green screen- and some of them seemed not to care much either- some not even sure what to look at or how to stand.  Borrowed some elements and visuals from Guardians‚Ä¶ in a very bad way. Potentially the worst Marvel movie in the series.
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don't know what happened but I was bored the entire movie.
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie it's very very bad
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,I had high hopes for this film but it let me down. I thought it was the worst of the Ant Man Movies. Jonathan Majors is okay as Kang but not enough to drive this film over the finish line. I like my Ant Man films with Ant Man as the main protagonist but it didn't feel that way throughout. The Quantum world is astonishingly boring and none of it is explained well enough for me to care about it. Biggest disappointment of the year so far for me. Marvel do better.
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked this movie.
Kang was phenomenal, and I absolutely loved the crazy fantastical world and societies. The ending did leave a lot to be desired (I cannot believe they chose to have everyone get away Scott-free (no pun intended) and unscathed). I also think it was interesting that they had to bookend the movie with scenes that obviously were meant to prepare the audience since this is not a typical Ant-Man movie and was instead incredibly different.
Also, as much as I want to hate on MODOK, I feel like this was the perfect opportunity to have him. He's a crazy looking, giant head - he fit right in with the rest of the crazy fantastical creatures."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang did not impress very much to be the next big avengers threat. Weird and corny. Mcu hasn't been much since endgame
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Um coc√¥ de filme, s√≥ n√£o √© pior que thor amor e trov√£o. Hist√≥ria fraca, √© esse o vil√£o do MCU? Pat√©tico. Os di√°logos que colocaram para Cssie s√£o rid√≠culos, em especial a luta dela com modoc. Aparentemente desaprenderam a fazer um simples filme divertido do Homem formiga, como eram os anteriores"
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the third installment in Marvel's Ant-Man movie franchise. It's about Ant-Man, the Wasp, their daughter and parents accidentally being trapped inside the Quantum Realm. Almost the entire movie is spent inside the realm, and so you can expect a lot of computer-generated imagery. The realm itself looks quite alien and magical, and we are introduced to several new characters. Cinematography and set design are beautifully rendered. It's a wonderful blend of actors and CG characters in one big adventure. For me, this is like the End Game of the Ant-Man movie series because of their struggles and epic battles. I don't quite understand why some of the critics don't like it, because for me, it's the best Ant-Man movie among the three. It's action-packed, epic and witty. It also showcases all of the lead actors and gives all of them a time to shine, especially Michelle Pfeiffer, as the original Wasp. Also worth mentioning is Jonathan Majors' effectively sinister performance as Kang the Conqueror. His character is definitely worthy to be the MCU's next ""Big Bad"" villain."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not the best in the series. Movie was missing some key actors, and story was lame. It was watchable, but not like the last two."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Gave it a 6.4 out of 10
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,No est√° mal pero pod√≠a estar mejor la historia
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man 3 falls flat with a lackluster storyline. The so random, Rick & Morty Humor (to be expected as it was written by one of their writers) feels forced, and the jokes fell flat, leaving me cringing more than laughing (that MODOK what was Kevin Feige thinking). 

The action sequences lack creativity, yet was also a CGI mess. The 3rd act final set piece were so poorly thought out that I literally could not tell who was fighting who some of the time.

Strongly performances from most of the cast especially Majors as Kang the Conqueror could not save this forgettable addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a big fan of the first two movies, this movie really sucked big time. Easily the worst movie in the mcu and worst movie of 2023"
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jonathan Majors excelled as Kang but the rest of the movie felt like most of the recent MCU movies - lackluster and stale.
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,I dont understand why rotten tomatoes makes so many mistakes you guys cause so many problem in movie theaters. This movie is actually pretty good not the best marvel movie but definately not the worst..
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Lacking the charm of the original movie, and the comedic genius of the first two movies - Michael Pena. Paul Rudd is great in his role, but there is just too much going on to save this movie."
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It was decent but didn't like the wasp hairstyle. That was really the only thing I didn't care for.
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Watched it on Disney+ and I see why it didn't do well ... Kang is great, Antman is great, but that's it ... and I HATE that they recast his daughter. Hate it."
"Jun 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"solid marvel movie, and second best of the antman movies"
"Jun 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,First watch it was great... Let's say there's no rewatchabitilty... the antman movies are my favourite in the mcu but holy crap this was so boring on rewatch
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good fun! C'mon rotten tomatoes critics lighten up
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I very liked the new characters they introduced officially Kang. Actions/Funny scenes are very good & Great CGI or VFX and Graphics.
The movie is very underrated!"
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,One never really gets to fall for the characters. Kang definitely looks ominous but the story did not allow for too much development on that front. Felt very episodic and rushed.
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"i expected a bigger villian better than thanos, we got ricky and morty lvl vilian."
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie just felt like they were missing the mark.
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Esse filme pra mim mostra a decadncia que os filmes da marvel ficaram, tentaram criar um diferente mas no me cativou, me fez desistir do filme criaram um universo quntico muito genrico e nada empolgante, os efeitos especiais so horrveis (algumas partes at salvam o filme) e as atuaes so bem medianas, no gostei."
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Perhaps not as bad as depicted by initial reviews, the 3rd Ant-Man installment introduces a formidable new villain in Kang without sacrificing the series' familiar fun banter and solid acting performances, though Marvel's attempt to raise the stakes falls flat when you consider it all occurs in a distant and alternate realm - a common theme that continues to undermine the latest phase of MCU films."
"Jun 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I wasn't expecting very much from this Marvel movie, but other than Jonathan Majors, I thought it was entertaining. Paul Rudd always surprises me with his comedic side that is just short of being annoying. Quantumania was good, not great - either way, I'd rather watch a new Iron Man movie over an Ant Man movie."
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Hilarious from start to finish.
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An insult to cinema, with terrible CGI just like the overall film. It was supposed to be the cornerstone of the new phase of the MCU, but it proves to be yet another flop. After Endgame, nothing but emptiness remains"
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,the worst graphics of all the MCU movies
"Jun 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"62%
It's alright. Above average.  Certainly a fairly enjoyable movie to watch with the family"
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful, I don‚Äôt understand what marvel is doing. Trying to make every film Sci-fi and they have been sucking at it"
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"very bad
bad story , bad effect"
"Jun 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"its the best ant man movie, but its not top 15 mcu movies or shows, i think it is the perfect way to start phase 5, especially after wakanda forever which is the only mcu movie i dont like, tied worse than the incredible hulk"
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, not very exciting."
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very funny movie but the CGI is the worst I think it is one of the marvels worst movie sorry
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What was that? That was terrible. I did enjoy Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, though she wasn't really in the movie bc Scott Lang's annoying daughter took her spotlight. The story was messy and I don't even understand why the writers think we care about the quantum realm which is just another excuse to do lame creative things with CGI. I want so badly for Marvell to get better but this was poorly written and most there characters felt more like junior high kids wrote them in. To quote the ""new"" Captain America, ""you've got to do better"" Marvel."
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just not a strong movie. I love Paul Rudd but I think we've seen all that we need from this franchise. It was a great was to give the backstory on Kang and that's about it. Marvel has been struggling post End Game and this movie falls right inline with the struggle. A movie just to push the universe plot forward with it being a good overall movie in the moment.
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fell asleep in the XD theater. So boring and acting was meh. jonathan majors and paul rudd were the definitive highlights.
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" may contain a strong and threatening performance by Jonathan Majors but an overload of CGI, weak plot, and hit-or-miss comedy make this film a mediocre disappointment, yet it does reach into so-bad-its-good territory at times."
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang's good and visuals are creative as always with Marvel. But the story is meh.
"Jun 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,MID. But Kang is so good in this movie however idk what's happening with Jonathen Majors
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Simply amazing. A truly great movie. I am completely confused why the ""experts"" hated it so much. I thought the action, storyline and comic relief were all well proportioned. The cameo's were fun but not overdone. As to whether this story continues, get's scrapped, or changes direction does not take away from this being a great movie for what movies are meant for. Entertainment!!!!"
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm a Huge Fan of Marvel Movies, but I think this one fell short.  Way too much CGI, Ant-man felt weak and the storyline was weak... I nearly fell asleep watching this movie."
"Jun 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,I felt it had alot of great action and humor . I also thought it was a great introduction to Kang.
"Jun 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantamania didn't reach the expectations that people wanted, but it constructed fairly well, with the new Big Bad of the MCU."
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Some interesting bit, but overall a bit of a mess and nothing really new."
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't like the theme & the plot of this movie. I really like Ant-Man (2015) & Ant-Man & the Wasp (2018) because they keep the world in Earth mainly while shrinking down in Earth at the size of an ant. I love the videography when Ant-Man & the Wasp are switching from small to regular to large while fighting bad guys. I also like the plot of Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp better. For Ant-Man & the Wasp (2018), it was to recover Hope's mother who has been trapped in the Quantum Realm for so long but most of the film is in Earth. I also like the depiction of the Quantum Realm in the second movie because it looked very subatomic like particles, protons, neutrons, & there was so much pressure in the Quantum Realm in the second movie. I like that better than a universe in the Quantum Realm.

The third movie is pretty much Guardians of the Galaxy and I don't like that theme for Ant-Man. I like Ant-Man to remain in Earth & have a great plot with those cool video effects of switching from small to large while fighting bad guys with the help of ants. I also like the scenes when the ants help out to defeat the bad guys. This is pretty much Guardians of the Galaxy for me & I don't like that. I want it to stay Ant-Man like it always was."
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Story meh.
Acting bad, except for Pauly Rudd.
Kang was good
Modok, sooo stupid
Kassie annoying teenager who contributes nothing.
Cgi, trash.
These movies coming from Disney as of late just feel like filler.
I'm waiting in between scenes to get to the point.
Trying to be patient.
Rather than enjoying these movies getting whisked away."
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"The lovable characters we've come to love and appreciate are back for a crazy adventure. Ant-Man: Quantumania is a great start for the MCU's phase 5 slate. Great special effects and  and a colorful cast, this movie is sure to fill that void in your life of action and adventure."
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was so bad, I logged in rottentomatoes for the first time ever just to give it a bad review. That was terrible"
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"In a new direction of fanatical and carefree world building, it sets the tone of the future by defining a key asset and bringing about a key villain in the most Ant-Man way possible."
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang the Conquerer was so well written and portrayed. To see him a half strength really makes you worry for the future of the MCU. Great overall story and felt like a more serious Ant-Man film. Have seen multiple times already!
"Jun 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was all right, not as good as the other two movies"
"Jun 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"We love all of the characters in this movie!  We love all of the actors in this movie!  That is why we were so surprised it was so boring.  üò≠. The first three minutes and the last three minutes are definitely worth watching, but in between?  Not so much.  (My husband, who LOVES this stuff, fell asleep!)"
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was amazing! Probably the best Ant-Man movie. But that's my opinion
"Jun 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was alright. Not as good as the other Antman movies. I think the story arc was weaker and without Luis and the guys, it just wasn't what it could have been. Still, it was worth watching, if only to continue the MCU story arc alive. Could have been much better though."
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,it filled the time slot in the blandest way possible
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Truly and frenetically awful. Incoherent messy surrealist claptrap; unworkable world and plot with schmalzy credulous scripting. Embarrassed actors who's primary motivation would be looking at their bank balance - oh Michelle, what have you done üòçüôÑ?"
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dissapointing in any way.. where this is going ?
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,The film is a lot better than I expected based on reviews
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,que decepcion y no lo digo por la pelicula lo digo por la presentacion del billano realmente no falla la pelicula accion aceptable y otras cosas que no tanto pero el guion malo malo.
"Jun 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Homem-Formiga e a Vespa: Quantumania √© uma obra cinematogr√°fica que prometia levar os espectadores a novos patamares de explora√ß√£o e descoberta, mas, infelizmente, falha em cumprir essa promessa de forma insatisfat√≥ria. O filme apresenta uma premissa intrigante e um universo fascinante, por√©m, acaba se perdendo em uma narrativa confusa e inconsistente. O principal ponto positivo sobre esta produ√ß√£o √© Kang, o Conquistador que promete levar o Universo Cinematogr√°fico da Marvel a outro patamar e com certeza vai mudar o MCU."
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a scattered plot to make things work. Ants and lost years and Kang duplicating himself. Still a fun watch, but nothing great."
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Almost unwatchable cluttered mishmash of better films.
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It had its moments and I rather like Paul Rud. There were definitely dumb conveniences to move the plot along, not to mention hard to ignore tonal issues, and I'm just not going to be that forgiving on a movie that praises socialism, sorry antifa-man."
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Felt like I was watching a spy kids movie
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Felt boring from the start of the film. Except the characterisation of Kang the movie was worst.
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp find themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that pushes them beyond the limits of what they thought was possible.

Why does everything always have to be bigger, especially with the Ant-Man movies. The thing that everyone enjoys about the first one, was the fact that it was a simple heist movie, on a small scale, but with great family dynamics, something that this movie completely lost. I thought that the opening was solid, but once we entered the Quantum realm, the movie loses steam very very quickly. Marvel should really learn from this movie and some of the other movies in the last year, that a whole CGI background with nothing real on set, looks absolutely awful and that is not the fault of the VFX artists, it's the problem of the crew on set, that thinks that everything can be sorted out in post, because the backgrounds look so bad, while the full CG shots look alright in most cases, at least passable. Jonathan Majors was the best part of this movie, and honestly the only good performance, besides Paul Rudd's okay performance, but doesn't really add a lot to the movie. If it wasn't for the concept of time, this would have been the most not interesting movie in the MCU, because the rest of the story is weak and a bad 3rd act, that we have seen a thousand times by now. All the newly introduced characters, are poorly and lazy developed, I literally can't give you a single name, besides M.O.D.O.K (a character that had no reason of being in this movie), of the newly introduced characters, including Bill Murray? I thought that the world building was poor and as well lazy, they just threw all the ideas that they had into the movie, and thought it would be alright. For the standard moviegoer, this might be passable, but I thought that this once again, hurts the brand of Marvel a lot."
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just another useless Marvel movie they has no reason to exist.
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kang is nice, but characters that have nothing to do there, are there. Crucial information is held by one of the main characters, and while walking and walking and walking ""there is no time to talk"". 

The effects are nice, the rest is a mess"
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the new characters they introduced. the story just seemed like they were trying too hard for it to be funny
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first Marvel film of 2023, the first film of the fifth phase, the third Ant-Man film and the 31st Marvel Cinematic Universe entry. While that may seem like a lot, the film isn't. I've always liked Ant-Man because he's the most genuine and grounded Earth superhero among the highly-fictional ones. His first villain was a scientist-businessman who wanted to weaponize science. His second villain is a restaurant owner with a criminal record who wields only a gun. Here, his villain is the next Thanos. Does it make sense that a human with shrinking abilities can beat a dude clad in a green and purple suit and a god complex? No, I don't think so, but he does.

The film opens with Scott Lang's life post-Endgame as he finds fame after writing a memoir. Ten minutes later, he and everyone else shrinks to subatomic size and spends the rest of the film in the Quantum Realm. They beat the exiled dictatorial conqueror of that world and go home. Halfway through the movie, I got bored, and my interest shrunk and probably went into the Quantum Realm. I apologise for my loathing and dislike for this movie; I believe no superhero can make this movie work. The problem lies in its fixation on excessive world-building, CGI, and visual effects that are nowhere as good as James Cameron's Avatar. There are so many different worlds that it gets boring because it seems that visuals are all the film seems to offer. Imagine a science fair where all the booths look so impressive visually, but there's absolutely zero actual science stuff.

Nonetheless, there's one thing going for the film that elevates it: the antagonist. Kang is the next Thanos, or he will be at some point. Jonathan Majors is remarkable and doesn't disappoint at all. He's dope and cool as hell, engulfing the entire two hours with real pain, fear, and poignancy. Across the MCU as a whole, I don't know what's his deal, what Kang wants, or what Kang is even - many variants. But in this film, he's just a guy who wants to go home and seek revenge on those who trapped him in a place beyond space and time. It also kinda sucks that he isn't any different from Thanos. He's equally prudent, intelligent and formidable. He spends the entire movie asking for help to shrink his means of escape - just like the Avengers finding the Infinity Stones. Kang threatens to kill Cassie in front of Scott and make him relive her death forever, but we all know it won't happen. It's just too dark for a family movie. There's a specific limit as to how frightening Kang can be, and let me tell you, that bar is shallow.

I'm already bored writing this review. I think everyone is exhausted from this movie, including the actors. They look so lost. In a colourfully psychedelic world that's supposed to be awe-inspiring, the entire cast lacks any excitement or a sense of wonder that they should have. Even Jonathan Majors, the standout, walks around and gives a monologue justifying his need to destroy all other universes. If Kang destroys all other parallel universes, what the heck is he gonna rule or conquer? I guess you could say it's only HE WHO REMAINS. 

This film is supposed to start a grander and more ambitious future. Still, it seems to be another tired adventure after the countless ones we've been on. Yes, I wanted a third Ant-Man film, but I wanted it to be just like the other two: realistic and fun, not high-stakes and too severe. But, well, Marvel wanted more profits, so they prioritised quantity over quality, which shows all too well. I'm not too happy about that, but two films ago, Scott Lang was fired from Baskin-Robbins, and before that, he was in jail and is still happy. I guess you could say happiness, like size, is a matter of perspective."
"Jun 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ant-Man Quantummania lacks a good storyline to keep you watching the whole movie. A typical superhero movie where the good guys win in the end and nothing really special. I feel that i've seen this movie 5 times just with other movies. The best part was the credit scenes.
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I didn't really enjoy this film, would I say it's a bad film..... No. Ant-Man Quantumania is typical Disney/Marvel present day writing where a younger female is taking over the lead. This seems to be the recipe with all Disney/Marvel content and I feel it's not working. The issue is we've paid to see the lead not a new ""better"" version especially characters that have no arc no progression or real story."
"Jun 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Kang's performance and the character is great. People are unfair with the critic, this was an above average movie, maybe not the best of the best."
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I feel like I've paid to see the wind. It's the kind of film that sticks to the phrase ""don't worry, you don't have to watch this one to understand it""."
"Jun 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Some effects are off, but I don't care about that. I enjoyed the movie. I like humor, and this one, like Thor Love and Thunder, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, has plenty of humor (Doctor Strange also had horror).  I'm sure my opinion isn't very popular, but bring on the humor please! To heck with all that attempt at awards phooey!
Down with Man of Steel! Hurrah for The Suicide Squad 2021!"
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Estuvo genial!!! Esperamos mucho por verla, y vali√≥ la pena. Paul Rudd ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The mcu seems to be obsessed with wick meaningless jokes, and loosely tired together characters.  Ant man quantumamia is a prime example.  Lacks any sort of depth or storytelling,  rather just a serious of seemingly random encounters and characters that try their best to fill the time."
"Jun 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Solamente una pel√≠cula para pasar la tarde, un mal argumento, y entra en el top de pel√≠culas con cosas raras e innecesarias como lo que hicieron con MODOK."
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,They spent a decade preparing for Thanos. One movie and we get Kang. He is boringgggg. Not scary. Marvel is officially a snooze fest 
"Jun 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not bad but definitely not good. I think the best part was the very end when they set up a new big villain, so the idea of the next story was better than this story."
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The MCU formula eats itself in this xerox of a xerox of a xerox of a story.  This marks the beginning of the Kang saga?  Oh please let
it be the end of it."
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I usually don't like the ""If I could give zero stars"" spiel but like if I could, this would be the movie for it. I'm so glad I didn't see this in theatres, I might have gotten too upset at the obvious scam. The ONLY noticeable thing about this movie, only thing I can say didn't suck complete ass, was the background and some alien design. Aside that, every single thing was terrible. Paul Rudd, I know you're better than this so wtf was going on here? Was rent due or something??"
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,All the plot holes and contrivances really ruined this film.   Characters act according to what the plot wants and nothing feels natural.   There are not themes and conclusions.   The whole movie is just another mess that makes less and less sense the more you think about it.   It ends in the same way it always does... a giant thoughtless war that has been done so many other times in others movies... and it has been done better.   The world building does not feel well thought-out.... It contradicts other movies like do you need a helmet on when you shrink or not.   I have no idea why they keep trying to make Evangeline Lily uglyer & uglyer with every film... as a feminist choice?   MODOK was so poorly done and did not even need to be in the film at all.  The writing in the MCU has gotten so lazy that the drop in quality is very noticeable.
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film was not bad. I understand what is lacking, though. It is the MCU series that affects the impact of this story as a standalone. It's just that... there are no real stakes. There are never any real stakes. It's starting to take away from the overall enjoyment. They almost had me here. I thought for a second, oh, someone is going to get stuck in the quantum realm as a cliffhanger. But no. See! No real stakes here. Happy ending like it's supposed to be. And, yes, the evolving ants were a deus ex machina. It wasn't a bad film. To be honest, the movie would not have any cultural footprint without it belonging to the MCU, and that is the very thing dragging it down."
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Watchable but like ant man is just made into a really dumb character, hank pymm or wtv is just not smart?? the daughter is annoying, the romance is quite a sad attempt at anything and the side characters feel like they dont have any significance except being vessels to move the plot along. I guess the cgi is fine, in that it is really good at points and sucks at others. Despite some of these most of the people that i know that watched it felt it wasnt bad so id think itd be watchable if you're not too into mvovies"
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,I think it was okay not a crazy backstory just things thrown in to make a story.
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Feels like the gimmick of Ant-Man isn‚Äôt even there. They‚Äôre all so small that they might as well all be normal sized. Feels more like a set up than an actual Ant-Man movie 
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Did not even last five minutes into the movie. The excessive wokness was painful to endure.
"Jun 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is kind of what I was expecting based on the last Ant-Man and Wasp. I knew it would be a step up but not a big one, the movie still is worth seeing but don't get your hopes up."
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um filme t√£o bom...., Minha fam√≠lia amou o filme, at√© o meu irm√£o amou, mais o filme n√£o √© uma perfei√ß√£o, nota 7,0"
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Mehn screw critics this was a dope film. The only problem with it though was the daughter. I personally don't think she acted the role properly.
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Antman movie!!! The Quantum Realm is so impression!!!
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,I love the Antman and marvel but this movie for me was a disaster.. terrible screenplay..im sorry if u liked
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Foi um filme bom, n√£o foi um filme √≥timo eu esperava mais."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was the worst movie I've seen in a very long time *without* the plug for socialism. Anyone who plugs socialism either has never picked up a legitimate history book, or else really likes seeing 10s of millions of people die enmasse."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best Antman film so of course it has the lowest box office. Brings back Kang from the Loki series. Also brings back the Antman 1 villain and brings us a possible replacement for Scott Lang going forward if they choose to go that route.
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,There hasn't been a good ant man movie since the first one
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don‚Äôt understand all the bad reviews? Granted, the CGI could have been better, but overall very enjoyable."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The script is not so bad, I'm not saying it's good but it's not bad either, just mediocre, I really liked the ending, especially the one-on-one battle between Scott and Kang and Majors' performance is excellent even though Kang as such is not crazy (in this movie).
But the editing is terrible, Hope does NOTHING, at times the effects look bad and I couldn't enjoy the movie when you noticed that the actors were on green screen. His Star Wars with ants turned out fatally."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I personally loved it for what it was and think ant-man's trilogy is underrated in general
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wasn't really good or bad, but certainly one of the less strong engines of the superhero movie train.

Some of the performances were decent, but the reliance on green screen and poor script didn't really help things. Effects looked as rushed as the the actors are to finish the film."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Ant-Man‚Äôs character is fleshed out more while also building up his supporting cast. We‚Äôre also seeing more if Kang‚Äôs character and how he can potentially impact the MCU in future movies. I would watch again.
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible movie... 
Was all over the place and gave me headache"
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's ok, not the best. Not something I'd watch it again. I love the characters in Antman though - and I love the ants too! The big battle in the end saved it for me."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It kind of jumped around a bit, but paid off in the end. Cool cameos and character development for the villain. "
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Es entretenida, ninguna maravilla, pero buena para pasar el rato."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Felt this is the worst of the Ant Man, but still a fun move overall. Kang is great, nice to see a different world. Not as funny as the last two movies, but it's moves well."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know why everyone has been so negative with this movie.  There was never a dull moment, the pacing was great, and it had a ton of funny moments.  Take this movie for what it is; ENTERTAINMENT.  That what it did.  It entertained."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"They just should made an animation movie for how much CGI they used, looks horrible fake. Boring movie. They should have ended Ant-Man with his first movie. Ant-Mans story is boring, he is a boring superhero. They should just stop using him in movies."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,Didn't think I would enjoy it but it turned out to be very funny.
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nobody ever dies. Rinse and repeat. Yawn. I refused to see this in the theater and boy was that a good call. Watching it while multitasking was less painful.
When are people going to tire of all this going nowhere superhero stuff. Paul Rudd is likeable so be likeable in a better movie. And the villain was painful in a soft slow talk boring way.
Yuk!"
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Could be better with a big bad like kang
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Don't regret it not seeing it in the cinema. Good foundation foreseeing op the villain Kang and therefor a must see.
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not the worst MCU film post Endgame but not the best either, the film itself is pretty lackluster, but it does do a good job of setting up the MCU's future endeavors. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly again do a great job in their roles as Ant-Man and the Wasp, their on-screen chemistry is one of the best the MCU has. Jonathon Majors plays Kang with great intensity, but I think where Kang falls short as a villain for me is the writing of his character, there is little to no reason or motive as to why he wants to Conquer and do all these terrible things he has planned. A good villain isn't one that just has the plan to destroy the universe but is instead shaped by their past actions or experiences that have given them a reason to think or act the way that they do, and in my opinion, Kang is very shallow as a villain when it comes to that. Now that can certainly change as we might find out more and more about him as the MCU progresses and I think Jonathon Majors did do a wonderful job with this character for what he was given. The other problem with this film is it feels too big of scale to be an Ant-Man film, the previous two were low stakes but had their fun and importance to the MCU, this one completely is a change of course for the Ant-Man trilogy. I wish that the movie wasn't just entirely in the CGI world of the Quantum Realm especially when there were definitely a lot of sequences that could have looked better. The action sequences weren't anything special for an Ant-Man film, the humor was alright, and the MODAK twist was fine. It's a film that had the opportunity to be unique and awesome in its own way but was instead just a standard MCU formula film set in the quantum realm."
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,This was a fun movie that furthers many of the themes in the MCU right now.
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Let me preface that I loved the previous Ant-Man movies and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. This movie, however, just really lacks good writing, editing, and flow. It's as if the project got scrapped and restarted repeatedly and this finally wrapped up just to have something to put out. (Spoiler filled review ahead)

Ignoring that the SFX dare anyone to use this movie to discover they're epileptic, let's talk writing. The overall story was weak. First Kang is discovered to be an exiled monster, then he wants out because something ""worse"" is coming, but never plays up that redeeming greater good card whatsoever. If what's worse is only more terrible versions of himself, then does it really matter which Kang is left to terrorize everything?

Also, the comedic relief or shock factors were either very unfunny, cringe, or not entirely suspenseful. Bill Murray's betrayal, completely predictable. Modok... lame. The jokes, blah. This does not live up to MCU.

Lastly the flow between the 2 parallel storylines has very awkward jumps. Neither really builds suspense for the other, and the way it's divided early on reminds me of listening to an excited child with ADHD tell a story.

I do hope MCU can reclaim its glory. This is just continuing the post-endgame slump."
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie is confusing. It's so bad it's good. Kang never really was a threat. The acting is terrible outside of Paul Rud and Jonathon Majors. But the cgi is laughable and the screenplay is so bad it's good. You will have a good time watching the movie if you get pasts it's flaws. 3/5
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,The storyline and excessive CGI really put me to sleep. Character designs were a little over the top and ridiculous. Not to mention it resembling a family superheroes like a Pixar movie. I know what to expect from The Marvels.
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was honestly just boring. The daughter being a superhero just ruined everything .
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible. Nothing about this movie made me enjoy watching it. The characters, the story, the acting. Not worth the watch."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie with a good plot & potential.  Could have pulled off better with the fantastic cast . MODOK is completely wasted üòí
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Solid MCU film. Majors shined in the role of Kang, really saved the film for me."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"ÎªîÌïú Ïä§ÌÜ†Î¶¨, ÌóàÏàòÏïÑÎπÑ Ï°∏Î≥ë, Ïó¨ÏûêÏïÑÏù¥ ÎùÑÏõåÏ£ºÍ∏∞, Ï§ë2Î≥ëÏùÄ Ïä§ÌååÏù¥ÎçîÎß®ÏúºÎ°ú Ï∂©Î∂ÑÌï®, Ï∫âÏùò Ïó∞Í∏∞Îäî Ï¢ãÏïòÏßÄÎßå Ïù¥ ÏòÅÌôîÏóêÏÑú Î©îÏù∏ ÎπåÎü∞ÏúºÎ°úÏÑúÏùò ÏúÑÏóÑÏùÄ ÏóÜÏóàÏùå."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"CG is beautiful but the plot is hollow. The whole story was just trying to bring out two characters: Kang which despite the hollow plot, Jonathan Majors did very well in bringing complexity to the character, which salvage the plot a bit for the 2.5 stars I gave. On the other hand, the acting of Kathryn Newton adds to the hollowness of the story. She only have one facial expression for the whole movie, and her face always keep the ""perfect"" beautiful looks, never have more than two strands of hair flinging outside of her otherwise perfect hairdo, never break any sweat on her smooth perfect skin. I would watch the next movie where Kang played by Jonathan Majors would be featured, but not one with Kathryn if she keeps the same quality of act."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme fraquissmo, quase nada se salva. O vil√£o kang que prometia ser mais poderoso que o thanos, sendo que na verdade ele √© um vil√£o muito ruim e fraco, a unica coisa que eu gostei foi da ultima cena pos creditos"
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Meh.  Didn't love the quantum universe setting - too much CGI.  Casey was annoying but that was her function.  Kang was underwhelming as the next big bad guy.
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,not too bad. it has some good parts. kang is the highlight of this movie.
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie is lack of aventure, characters and definitely to much green screen for the special effects. It was like an avengers version of the movie Honey I shrunk the kids. The best of the movie was the acting of Paul Rudd and the scene with Bill Murray."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible and very disappointing. I feel bad for the actors, it's the fault of the script."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another blah entry in a blah canon. The only bright spot was Jonathan Majors. Also, whoever came up with and digitized MODOK should be fired and then lobotomized."
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best marvel movie since endgame üëç
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is better than 1 and 2. One of the best marvel movies! Jonathan majors had amazing acting same thing with Paul Rudd! Can‚Äôt wait for 4!
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Feels like a 2-hour-long trailer.
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was really good! Its funny and very cool visually! The story was good,although there are many weird stories to it so it is very weird.but it is still good and I recommend! 8/10"
"Jun 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a Passable Mess. The acting is ok and in theory should work just like the other 2, btu the jokes fall flat constantly and there is no charm to any of the performances. Majority of the time they just explain plot and what happened 30 years ago. The villain Kang is just ok and his henchmen is terrifying to look at in a laughably bad way. I'm also not sure why this is called Ant-Man & The Wasp because Hope doesn't do much in this. The cinematography isn't bad. There are lots of times there are tons of cool visuals to look at that pop and have epic scale. However each time those are offset by lifeless scenes that are too dark too see half the time and have nothing going on in the background. Combine that with the nothing special acting and you get some surprisingly really boring scenes in the middle especially. Also, there are times where despite the creativity there is a huge lack of practical sets that match the green screen visuals and you get a lot of scenes with oversaturation of CGI. There are cool fight scenes though that involve growing and shrinking that are the hallmark of this franchise. The music is boring, generic, and forgettable. The editing is ok and the pacing isn't bad. The problem is this is more interested in explaining the plot with no character development for any returning characters beyond making Kassie a unlikeable pretentious jerk. Also many times even though they are in the Quantum Realm they don't really ever experience it. The closest way to explain it is majority of the time we never get a ground level view and build lore we just see it from a drive by tourist bus. The ending fight is cool to look at and has some cool moments though and there are some cool moments like all the Ant-Mans together but this doesn't come anywhere close to the fun and uniqueness of the first two. I can't really recommend this to anyone except die hard Paul Rudd fans or die hard Ant-Man fans who are fans of the comic. Otherwise just watch a 5-10 minute YouTube summary of this to prepare for Kang in the next Avengers."
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantamania is a thrilling adventure set in the marvel cinematic universe. Visually the film is amazing. It looks like a Guardians of the galaxy adventure with ant-man. The villain in this film is the big point in this film. Kang is such a mysterious villain and is the best villain since Thanos. The soundtrack is epic in every way. While the naming of each song is odd choice it still is a ride just to listen to. The only bad thing about this is the fact it is too short. Only 2 hours. If it was longer it could have been a bigger of a ride but because of that it looses half a star. I highly recommend it though. It is a great start to Phase 5 of the MCU.
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is about the worst marvel movie. I've seen it with all over the place. I didn't want my attention. Was not worth going to see.
"Jun 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,meh just okay not as good as the hype
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the critics are not fans of comics. As a long time marvel fan I enjoyed the movie. It wasn't as funny as the first two, but still very did the job. I would see it again for sure."
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Special FX and CGI were fantastic. Literally the only thing recommendable about this movie. Horribly written characters. No one at all is likable except Ant-man (barely) and strangely the villain Kang. Maybe the hole obsessed alien monster guy? This movie just didn't have it. Won't watch again.
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Hopefully this was a true story and Kang kills us all before I watched this.
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania is not a good film.  The story is unfocused and has pacing issues.  The directing and writing is also not so good.  Most of the characters just stand around talking stuff that should be important, but is not.  I do see effort in here with the massive world that the film takes place in but the world  is poorly developed and by the end of the film I did not know how things worked in the world it sets up. And finally I'd like to give this film an award for the worst product placement I've seen all year!"
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was kinda boring, and where was Lu√≠z? The others are way better"
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it was an alright movie.  Felt more like it was a filler trying to set up the next parts of marvel villian then a stand alone movie.  But not a horrible film in any sense, it just felt like it was hindered by having to intruduce the next big baddie , and give a big visually bang at the end"
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Don't waste your time watching this
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a huge fan of Antman I really wanted to love this movie, but it was just OK. It wasn't terrible,  but it wasn't great. The ENTIRE movie is in the quantum realm (eith the exception of a few minutes in the neginning) so it's all CGI. I've found previous quantum realm scenes to be a bit like a ghost pepper. You can add some flavor by putting a tiny bit in a large pot of soup, but eating a whole one by itself is painful. Paul Rudd is good as always and Michelle Pfeiffer has a prominent role which really builds her character. On a side note Pfeiffer looks absolutely incredible for 65, I would have guessed she was 40 if I didn't know better. 

Overall it just feels like a lazy entry that was made just to make another Antman movie. It could have been so much better with less quantum world. Don't get me wrong, the CGI is exceptionally done, there's just way to much of it to the point it gets boring.

At the end I just felt like I was playing a video game I didn't want to play anymore."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Antman and the Wasp was one of the worst Marvel movies. Just disappointing over all don't know what to say. Only thing good about this film was the ""new next bad"" Kang. The biggining of the story was just so boring, although it had a good action scenes but boring overall. L for Marvel."
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,it had it upsides and downsides
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"OMG I hated this film so bad, how many terrible monologues can you squeeze into one film, this was so bad it was a she hulk contender for crappiest Marvel production.  Just another example of how Marvel cant produce a good villain in movies these days.  The best bit was the ending scene"
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Hard to find much I liked, maybe the ending? A CGI world of weird creatures basically, doesn't fit at all‚Ä¶not good, see for yourself."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Welcome to Quantum Mania where the main actor Rudd Paul takes a back seat and the female characters get more everything: lines, screen time and some plot-hole storyline.
It lacks the 'Bang' that most MCU movies have. The acting, the CGI, the villain, and the designs were mediocre. I wish I could have my money back. We need a whole anthem for Disney/Pixar named ""We want our money back"" for dissatisfaction and lack of creativity. 
I'd love to be an ant or a fly on their walls and see & hear what they are up to and walk in any time of day and change their concepts. Don't worry guys I'll take your ideas and write them on the board, send me your thoughts. Thanks! üòâ"
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A lot more fun and entertaining than some early reviews suggested. Some silly childish dialogue befitting Disney's somewhat tone deaf approach to movies that have mostly an adult audience (Thor Love & Thunder is an example of brutally poor writing and destruction of Asgardian lore). However it does set up an interesting plot device for Marvel going forward. Pace and effects are pretty good, they didn't really wrap up some loose story ends but for a super hero movie it's ok. Worth a watch and definitely enjoyable."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was felt like a cheap star-wars ripoff. At least it was some-what entertaining. 
Edit: I just saw a critic review and it was what I said."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was a disappointment. I don't know where to begin. It looked cheaply made with bad special effects and a too obvious green screen.  Michelle Pfeiffer wore too much makeup and her hair looked different in every scene.  Yes, she's gorgeous but this movie isn't about aging gracefully with hair and makeup. Her character wasn't believable. She looked too fake. The movie lacked humor. It was very boring. Why was Evangeline Lilly's character so minimal? I wanted to see more  of her. She's the Wasp, yet she had little dialogue.  Why? I felt sorry for her and Paul Rudd. They both are great actors but this movie did not showcase them enough. 
Jonathan Majors and Katy O'Brian were excellent."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Entertaining, bad jokes and a waste of plot"
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,these movies would NOT be what they are without Paul Rudd; i just love him. i really enjoyed it - quite comical & plenty of action.
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a great joy to watch. I enjoyed the characters and the story and the effects. The potential to expand from here may not get paid off in future films but it contributed to the MCU omniverse.
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A great villain that gets undercut by convenient plot holes and overly familiar dialogue that undermines what should be serious situations. Some terrific action and small doses of terrible CGI, that took me out of the story at times. I had a fun time, but wanted to like it more."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"To kick of the start of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Marvel Studios surprised me with this subpar movie. I enjoyed the past two Ant-Man movies in the trilogy, but this third one was disappointing to say the least. The writing for the story was lazy, and most plot points were predictable. The acting was also unfavorable, and I was especially surprised at Paul Rudd's poor performance as the lovable Scott Lang/Ant-Man. The introduction of the Multiverse and the Quantum Realm at the same time is a little fast-paced for the audience to digest; the only compliment I have for this film is Jonathon Major's portrayal as the villain, Kang the Conqueror, as he reprised his role from the Disney+ show, Loki."
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Probably the worst MCU movie made.  Worse than Thor II and Ironman III.  Rudd was ok.  Everything else was horrible.
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I must express my utter disappointment with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. It lacked the charm and humor that had previously made the franchise so enjoyable. The plot was convoluted, boring, and difficult to follow, while the action sequences were uninspired. The characters were underdeveloped and felt flat, making it impossible to invest in their fates. I was also disappointed that most of the sets were completely CGI. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this movie to ANYONE looking for a satisfying superhero adventure. more boring than studying for the math final. Waste of 2 hours."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,I actually not a fan of the previous ant man movies but this one came out more entertaining and much more fun than the predecessors.
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Every decision that went into this movie was approved by someone. That truly blows my mind.
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"La historia esta mal establecida, no ser logra empatizar mucho con los personajes y no tiene buenas bases. Pep s√≠ es a algo divertida, falto Luis."
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Over budget CGI crap is a thing of the past, guardians of the galaxy & the mandorlorian shows that filing on location & using practical effects get you to come out on top, the quantum realm did not feet real, no grounded, plus Kang is the the new Thanos & got his ass kicked by Antman & gang with no consequences or sacrifices, I will only rewatch thanks to Johnathan Majors, he delivered the Kang I needed same with He Who Remains in Loki, such a shame he had to be apart of this quantum mess"
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So boring I fell asleep. Kang seemed to have almost no character development. Most of the movie seemed to revolve around family drama, very little action. I was really disappointed."
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme sem sal, n√£o encanta nem uma crian√ßa"
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wanted to like just so slow.
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"We love all of the marvel movies and also Paul Rudd, Michelle Pfieffer and Jim Murray but oh my we didn't even get to the end so still have 20 mins to watch and haven't been bothered to watch it as yet, 2 weeks later, unprecedented for our family. This was so disappointing for us, so sorry but it didn't come close to the other movies in our view. Love the actors."
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was just ok. Nothing super great and feel short of what Marvel has done in the past.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"While the plot is a little weak, this is a very fun film with lots of comedic moments!"
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was not bad. While not amazing, it's pretty good. Visuals are okay, except for M.O.D.O.K."
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The previous Ant-Man movies were some of my favorites in the MCU, so I was excited to watch Quantumania. However, I was disappointed with how they portrayed Kang, the film's antagonist. Kang is supposed to be the franchise's super-villain after Thanos, but his story arc and development comes nowhere near that of Thanos. Thanos was a great antagonist because he presented a real threat; the full strength of the Avengers wasn't enough to stop him at first. However, Kang was defeated fairly easily by arguably the weakest Avenger. Thanos was eventually defeated too, but his plan to wipe out half of the life in the universe succeeded and even after the Avengers brought everyone back, the after effects of half the population dissapearing and reappearing after 5 years is significant. Kang failed in his mission completely and left no noticeable mark in the world, making him a disappointing villain for the audience. Furthermore, knowing that there are infinite versions of Kang across the multiverse and that he can come back any time cheapens any victory the heroes have against him. Marvel film writers have an uphill battle in saving the Kang villain arc.

Another disappointing part of the movie was how the writers tried to force comedy into every scene. The previous two Ant-Man movies were effortlessly funny and the jokes felt organic. The forced jokes in Quantumania made parts of the movie felt corny and difficult to watch."
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Just saw it on Disney+. Must say it's a lot better than the critics made it out to be. I think the paid critics are completely out of touch with the mainstream audience. I give the critics one star and this movie four stars.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Tuve la oportunidad de verlo en preestreno, es una buena pel√≠cula , efectos , ambiente, actores, etc . Pero el p√∫blico, se queja de que como unas hormigas le ganaron a Kang, bueno en mi perspectiva, yo si le veo sentido, ya que las hormigas pasaron miles de a√±os evolucionandose, tiene mejor tecnolog√≠a que Kang, ya que Kang (variante el conquistador) es solo un ser humano que solo tiene buena tecnolog√≠a para pelear y conquistar, pero es solo habr√° estudiado pocos a√±os pero es una mente brillante, pero las hormigas pasaron m√°s a√±os estudiando hay es el sentido de como le ganaron a Kang. Pero no gusto que lo  M.O.D.O.K (personaje que desde mi infancia lo conoc√≠ por primera vez), solo para q se muera 4/5"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Love it. 
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,My wife and I actually really enjoyed it. Definitely should trust the audience score more than the critic score. Beautiful and fun movie with some sprinkles of cheesy writing but overall we really enjoyed it more than we thought we would
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A bit of a mess.  I'll stop short of saying I hated it, but it was not good.  I knew it was a matter of time before Disney blurred the lines between Marvel and Star Wars, this movie is proof.  It could have been titled Ant Man in Mos Eisley.  Weird slimey booger type things that shoot lasers?  Really?  If you're totally bored give it a watch, but prepare to fall asleep.  Spoiler, they have M.O.D.O.K. in it....bigger spoiler, he looks terrible.  It reminds me of the CGI in She-Hulk.   I think the MCU has passed its peak and at this rate will fade away soon.  The magic just isn't there any more."
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was a let down from top to bottom. The CGI was comical at times and just wasn't able to engage in the story. Felt completely different than what I loved about this franchise. The villain didn't live up to expectations and the whole movie seemed to pass with little to no consequences for characters. No desire to watch again.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Completely enjoyed it
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ant Man 3 feels more like a Kang movie than an Ant Man movie. It's a fun time but the MCU quality's are more noticeable than ever.
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang's acting saved this movie. Ant man's dad's acting almost killed it. Story was really good!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually adhering to the established Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor escapism, the third Ant-Man episode is an entertaining movie for fans and newcomers. While it doesn't continue the down-to- earth frolics of the two previous films, it does expand on the MCU material and introduces new concepts and villains. The cast is great all around."
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was terrible!!! And ""Paul Rudd"" Is definitely not Superhero material. 2 hours of my life I will never get back!"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,This was entertaining and fun to watch. Definitely recommend it!
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely terrible my Dad is currently in the hospital and my mom is now serving life in prison.

Thanks Ant Manüòü"
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,(Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing) and he can neither aim nor kill when he's ordered to! He had ample opportunities to kill the daughter easily but just.... didn't. What a joke. Lazy writing and a God awefull way to bring inn a classic character into the MCU
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Esta peli esta tan culera que me sorprende que los de marvel no se dieran cuenta de lo mala que era
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible.  From beginning to end, just terrible.  No plot, no fun, unnecessary visual effects, awful script, bad acting.  Serious waste of time.  Had more fun power-washing my driveway."
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,bad acting. bad plot.
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Realmente decepcionante, esperaba realmente algo que sorprendiera, esta pel√≠cula estaba de m√°s hacerla."
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What to say? It's okay but boring the most of the time. Paul Rudd is as great as he always is but it doesn't save the movie. Visually the movie is interesting but sometimes things happen and you wonder why they did that. The end is also really anticlimactic.. 
Normally you have to watch everything to understand what's going on in the MCU but not this movie. Don't watch it unless you really want to."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"TO DMSS, SLC FILME TOP"
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Watchable, just like every Antman's movies"
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"WITNESS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW DYNASTY

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a 2023 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics.

"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. Lots of action and special effects.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,West Coast Avengers  Assemble!!
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,It is Star Wars in alotta ways and it pains me to say that. Enjoyable but Star Wars.
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, not the best but it was alright."
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring and got a weird Frankenstein vibe of the whole movie with too many weird stuff squeezing into 2 hours. Characters except Ant man are all not very likeable.
A disappointing way to introduce the next big villain of MCU. wasn't able to showcase how powerful and frightening Kang is, which is unfortunate."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It was entertaining but slow too
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"With sloppy writing, acting, and visual effects all over the place, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an OKAY comedic adventure with a great threat of a villain, but with some very prominent flaws. The standouts of the film are Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas and Jonathan Majors. I recommend watching this film if you want to keep up with Marvel but if you do not, probably stay away from the film. I think Kang is a great villain, but nearly defeated by ants? Ridiculous. It is fun, but extremely flawed, and one of the MCU's lesser movies in my opinion. Two and a half stars from me."
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang was horrible. Very very drawn out movie in parts. But I still give it 3 stars bc I love Antman.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Buen√≠sima me encant√≥ Michael pfieffer sin duda se roba la pel√≠cula tiene un giro muy bueno cuando se desvela quien es el verdadero villano y sus intenciones.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good.  Got a little weird on some spots. Funny in others.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pure fun, a great ride through the quantum realm. Thoroughly enjoyed it, despite the critical reviews"
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not that bad, but not that good either. Just meh, despite some heavy lifting from Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors."
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No es tan mala como la vendieron, pero es realmente muy llana y con pocas cosas resaltables. Podr√≠a haber sido un especial de menor tiempo y la historia funcionar√≠a de igual manera. Lo √∫nico relevante es Kang y lo importante que puede llegar a ser en el futuro del MCU."
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,most of the hate ive seen has been on the cgi but i didnt consider it that bad the other major clitisisim ive been seeing is the comedy but the complaints about it are very inconsistent half say theres too much and the other say too little in my opinon its just people hating on superhero movies id recomend a watch if your not against super hero movies
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Enough silly superhero movies. So redundant.
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Waste of time and money. Effects are good but the tone of the movie and the very bad dialogues ruin it. 
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"My goodness this movie was terrible. Just a bunch of meandering nonsense. An out of place cameo. Non-sequiters. The dialogue was clunky, like something written by a 5th grader. Disney should be embarrassed."
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolutely sh*t it's like a little kid wrote the movie also terrible cgi what's going on with marvel??
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As far as Marvel movies go - jiminy christmas this is a low blow. I love Paul Rudd. And I really wanted to love this movie. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfiefer couldn't even save this movie. 

The villain was great (great casting). But the ending was awful. The script was awful. And Evangeline Lilly was particularly awful. There is no chemistry between her and Paul Rudd. And there were a few plot holes that were too much to overcome. 

No thanks. Wouldn't watch it again for free."
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The greatest part of the film is Majors as Kang. The plot, the acting, the character developments, the side characters were all extremely half baked. If the MCU can't bring real weight to even the smallest stories, it'll be hard to remain invested."
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Unfairly vilified, Quantumania is a fun time that unfortunately favors brightly colored action over true human moments, leaving many of the moments that we should be cheering getting shrugs instead."
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,The ending ruined everything and it was a waste of money to produce. Not as bad as Thor love and thunder but that isn‚Äôt saying much it‚Äôs too campy and is just there to set up Kang.
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,it's not bad. but could have been better
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,The changed so much of the character backgrounds that the only thing left of Kang the Conqueror and MODOK from the comics was their names. This is the second worst marvel film since marvel started releasing live action films and I say that with all the love I have for other Marvel films. Complete and utter garbage film.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, funny,beatiful. I like it..."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme n√£o √© perfeito, tem suas falhas. O filme segue uma linha diferente dos dois primeiros, mas o filme √© bem divertido e com v√°rios momentos legais. Uma √≥tima introdu√ß√£o para Kang."
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not as good as the other, but still ok."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you've followed the Marvel movies for the last decade this is a good story continuation while introducing some new villains and planets.  

If you haven't followed them this might be tougher watch for a one off comic movie."
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I can't believe how Marvel has gone down on quality. In the scene where the dunking guy is in it, he literally looks like a cardboard cutout afterthought that the director just enters the poor VFX guy and says ""Wouldn't be funny if we do this right? NOW DO IT"". The plot doesn't make any sense. But I could get pass the part where they stop the plot for a few seconds to tell us how good socialism is!!! In a Marvel movie!!!"
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Antman movie. But if it weren't for Jonathan Majors as Kang and Paul Rudd's charm this would be lower on my MCU list.
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,I was glad when it was over
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a fun romp and brilliant eye candy.
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie could have been a great one but with lot of dents in the story and typically making the story just for the sake of doing another installment for Ant man doesn't make it enough.
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"i saw the edited version on Disney+ and i thought it was pretty good except for the actress that played the rebel leader= gross overacting-very cringe, but the rest of the characters were good. 
But, from the beginning in Loki series, the writers do not show Kang as he is in the comic books- we see that part of him only a few times in the movie- he is supposed to be like the Roman emperor Caligula and he acts tooo wimpy most of the time= not his fault- it is the writers"
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bruh Kang became very desperate to get out of the Quantum Realm.
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was a fun watch, but some characters didnt seem like they were written very good and the movie just seemed rushed."
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,It sucks like no other movie of Marvel ü§¢ü§Æ
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's probably because the film tries too hard to be funny that it ends up being not. Scott (Paul Rudd) and Hope (Evangeline Lilly) are a lovely couple but the script simply does not do them justice. Kathryn Newton's Cassie Lang is an annoying presence in the film as are Corey Stoll's Darren and Bill Murray's Krylar. And don't get me started on those quantum realm creatures (""I have holes!"" Huh?). It's a good thing the whole loud and humor-less shebang takes place in the quantum universe-- we regular people don't have to see any of it!"
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"When we talk about Marvel movies, it should be funny and exciting. However, this ant-man kind of drowning and confusing in the story and character. You may think ""Why it doesn't...."" or ""How come ...."" or ""Is it really..... "" etc about it while you watch this."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,What a great MCU movie! It was perfect to tie in the storylines. Goes right into the action and keeps you entertained. Not sure why it got bad feedback... I put off watching it initially and regret it. I've always been a Hank fan and loved the colony ants in the quantum realm!
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Way way, way too much going on in the oververy produced mess.  No bueno."
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow, this one really, really fell flat. Where's the joie-de-vivre? I watch MCU movies to have a mindless good time. This one only got half that equation right."
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pretty meh. confusing and it seemed like none of the characters mattered
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"First of all Kang is such a good villain and it's probably the only reason I'll keep on watching MCU movies. 
Most bad reviews I see talk about the bad CGI and that Cassie can do almost anything, personally I haven't noticed that much bad CGI other than when they fall into the Quantum realm and when there are multiple ant man. Yeah it's weird that Cassie has managed to create a GPS for the Quantum realm when she's just a teenager (I think, don't rly care what her age is), but other that she's smart she can't do anything else: she's bad at fighting, she needs her dad for anything.
Modok definitely could have been used much better, but I still wonder when he gets beaten up why does he cough white jist and not blood I mean I get it he probably does something to Kang if you feel me but come on man :).
My biggest wonder is why doesn't Kong give back Cassie to Scot I mean is he a pedophile or what?
Also what's up with the pacing in this movie every dialogue and fight(except for the last one) only lasts for a few seconds. Why do some ants defeat Kang?
The last thing thank you all mighty lord for at least putting Hank in this movie even though he only says one liners it's still Hank."
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst MCU movie to date. Feels like generated by AI. Any single funny joke. No tension, no real stake. Kang has it's good moments but overall it falls VERY flat as a begin of next phase."
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's an entertaining way to pass the time. I think Paul Rudd is spectacular in anything that he does, and this was no exception. If it wasn't for his comedic timing and the overall stellar cast the movie would have felt far more like a computer game. Cast and acting really saved the day, on a movie that is mostly CGI and special effects. It opens a really nice opportunity to expand the ""Antman/Wasp"" stories into a new generation, if Marvel chooses to do that. And I really hope they do!"
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was straight poopoo, I'm talking a fat stack of doo!
The cuts made me sick, the conflict didn't make any fuckin' sense who it was supposed to be... Well... At least it wasn't clear, until you get about four fifths into the goddamn thing! The humor was horrible! It was sooo out of place when these ""JOKES"" appeared from nowhere.. AND! NOT TO MENTION! Most of the ""jokes"" weren't even funny... I was devastated through and through... And it genuinely disappointed me. I thought it was Ant-Man! Not, ""Grab-A-Quick-Buck-Man"""
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was just a bad movie and the CGI was terrible, it looked like a cheap knock off Marvel movie."
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Poor acting, no character development, and a boring script."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant film! 
I do enjoy the Ant Man films."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"SO FUNNY AND CUTE, LOVE IT"
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,the only good thing about the movie is Jonathan Majors as Kang. the dialogue is very poor i dont even wanna talk about the scene between Cassie and Modok. The way they beat a villain of this level is fricking unbeliveable. Ant-Man 3 is a mixed bag of okay and bad to be honest
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"idc if ppl agree with me or not, but after NWH this is geniunely a nice MCU movie , had so many expectations from MoM but only it's visuals were great, not the story line but this movie had it all , comedy , seriousness ,  great visual effects and most importantly great villain with a nice plot and story line . love the movie so much !!"
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very disappointed not even a 1/4 through and can barley watch this bad cgi... im sorry marvel fans L in chat!
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie was nice ,but 3* because,how the hell Cassie built a thing that hank wasn't able to built ? Story is fkd up"
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"What did I just watch? The story is all over the place, it's like they tried to mix different plot lines to make the new MCU saga work and make sense. It does have some good moments that make this movie worth watching (specially if you're into superhero stuff). It's not a top-tier MCU movie, but it's not a bottom-tier movie either."
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Marvel needs to step up their game if they think this is passable. What a cgi mess this is. There were a few cool parts but boy it's movies like this that make me want to wait until they hit streaming before wasting money to see something like this is theaters. Glad I waited.
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A good marvel movies, there are a lot, but Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is so horrible, for me, the CGI is bad, the story is bad, If you wanna see it it's Ok, but I don't recommend."
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Could of been better but good movie
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Whilst it can sometimes start to crumble under its own weight, it's still manages to build an incredible new dimension to the MCU while putting a chilling antagonist at the centre of it all. Excited for what's to come."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Um bom vil√£o mas n√£o traz nada de novo de verdade, o mesmo visual que todos os Guardi√µes da Gal√°xia."
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,La peor de Marvel junto con The Eternals. El CGI mal√≠simo y di√°logos que hace que nos salgamos de la historia a cada poco. Un p√©simo broche a las pel√≠culas de un superh√©roe tan grande como Ant-man. La Avispa apenas tiene peso en la historia. Kang se perfila como buen villano pero hasta ahora no es ni de lejos tan aterrador como Thanos.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ant-Man went from a grounded superhero to Star wars
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania has it's flaws but is blown out of the water by Johnathan Majors performance as Kang The Conqueror and the spectacle of the quantum realm that draws influence from classics such as Dune and Mad Max
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a good movie but although Ant-Man is my favorite superhero to the third movie lacked.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,They obviously spent a lot of money on the visual effects but I couldn't wait for it to end which it never seemed to do. And then I realized I could have spent better time staring at the wall and thinking about my life
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me senti lendo os quadrinhos quando era crianca. Cheio de furos de roteiro, mas uma excelente diversao."
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Falto. Falt√≥ algo no me atrajo mucho...
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"We walked out after an hour. I watched Guardians 3 first, so maybe I was just so entertained by that one that this felt like such a train-wreck? I was just so bored."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,What a waste of time
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, some odd choices with the villains but still love the MCU"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the better recent Marvel movies.  Visually cool and a fun ride.  Some light humor, but not overdone.  Well worth the watch!  Better than the last Ant Man movie from my perspective."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A m√≠ s√≠ me gust√≥ la pel√≠cula, üòé"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,No es una mala pel√≠cula... Le falt√≥ algo de personalidad nada mas
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Comedic cgi on MODOK aside, it was a good movie, that wouldnt have happened had Janet just been a normal person and explained even one thing she experienced prior to Stature building the quantum radio."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,What is it with the critics reviews? This is a fantastic film! Critics know NOTHING! Loved it!
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Paul Rudd couldn‚Äôt save this film from awful writing. 
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was OK, not as bad as critics were saying."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Way better than She Hulk or Eternals. Way better than any of the old X-Men and Spiderman movies as well. Even my wife enjoyed it and watched the entire movie from beginning to end. I actually enjoyed it more than any of the new live action spiderman movies personally and would be interested in an extended directors cut. The only negative was I don't care for the Kang actor but I actually like the Kang character. Disney should just recast him and stick with their original idea of Kang being a new Thanos level character. Considering he is a multiverse character recasting him would actually take zero explanation in the story, just look at all the Loki variants"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"me gusta la pelicula, toda la historia se sintiera fresca sin se sintiera fuera de contexto, como manejaron el villano sin desacreditar su poder que siempre estuvo por encima de los protagonistas. ya el resto de cosas que pasan va mas al tema de un mundo cuantico, ahi cualquier cosa es posible donde las leyes de la fisica y la naturaleza que conocemos no son iguales alla. asi que el final de las hormigas super inteligentes es pasable"
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst marvel movies i have watched. Glad I didnt buy a movie ticket to watch this movie. 
Movie feels like a ""filler"" just to update the audience for some key details for later films. Almost unbearable to watch. Feels like a ""bollywood"" StarWars (no offence to bollywood)."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So, I watched this on Disney+ last Saturday night. It was okay. Not terrible and not great, but somewhere in the middle. It kept my interest so I'm not sure why the critics hated it. Definitely went overboard on special effects, but I guess there is no choice in a movie like this. Cheers."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Another addition to the Marvel Universe. Meeting all of the hallmark checkboxes of being a big box action movie. However in an infinite number of universes, can we get a little more creativity on other ""species"" nearly every last one is a bipedal humanoid...done 1,000 different ways. Mix it up already."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was so bad. Like, really really bad."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although the movie gets rid of some charactors from the other Ant Man Films, it is still a fun and action packed movie with a fantastic villian."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rid√≠culo, sem criatividade e vergonhoso.

Ol√°, meu nome √© Roberto Ramires e essa √© minha cr√≠tica ao filme:

Meu deus, a Marvel est√° mais perdida que nunca nesse t√≠tulo. Piadas idiotas, um vil√£o que n√£o causa medo; e agora a pior parte, qual o prop√≥sito desta hist√≥ria??? Eu n√£o sei e, aparentemente, a Marvel sabe menos ainda."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't really know what to say about this movie. There is a strange dull hum across the entire film. It reminds me a lot of my experience with Attack of the Clones in that it feels like an expensive film that wasn't actually directed. I don't feel any choices. We're in shots because someone is talking. The shots don't add anything to the storytelling. 

I wonder if the filming of this was really affected by COVID and people couldn't be in the same room? I'm not sure. But often if feels like the characters aren't actually talking to each other. 

In that, this (and Eternals) feels like a kind of Iron Man shot in the dark. Marvel had success with incomplete scripts before and this script felt like a really good 1st draft. Good ideas, covers the broad strokes of a story, but it doesn't work yet. 

This movie is baffling to me."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great humor, very thrilling, great atmosphere, great movie. 
The design of the Quantum world alone is one of the best things in Cinema History.

Absolute must see if your an Marvel fan"
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There's was reason why I didn't bother watching this movie and waited for it to be on Disney+. There's a good reason for this too, if you think that you will be getting the same, funny and likeable Antman from previous movie.. well you are wrong.

There were only a handful of comedy scenes in this movie that I laughed at while the rest were just predictable, slow and annoying to watch.

Why would Janet not tell her family about Kang in the Quantum Realm until the second half of the movie. God that felt like forever.

The amount of time Scott screamed out for Cassie was more than Rick from The Walking Dead screaming for Carl.

Also how did Cassie build her own suit? This was definitely a rushed introduction to Cassie to replace Scott as the AntMan in the new Marvel Avenger. 

The so called Kang the Conqueror being all bad and mighty reminds me of the villain from Phineas and Ferb that spent 20 minutes explaining his evil plan and plot. Maybe he got exiled because he's incompetent in the Kang council. Lmao

Oh and Darren comeback was an unnecessary cameo but Cassie with her amazing speech of ""don't be a dick"" magically transformed him to a good guy. Wow.. so inspiring we all can learn something from Cassie.

Now the highlight of the movie was definitely the ants that came in to save the day. The movie could be called Ants: Quantumania.

This movie makes no sense and thank god I didn't waste my money. It's a good introduction to Kang the conqueror but in terms of CGI and good story telling it was mediocre at best."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,didn't deserve all that hate but it's not very good either. I mean yeah I have fun time watching it.modock was probably the worst part of the movie overall just fine film
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bad. Unnecessary. As a mid phase movie‚Ä¶eh. As a launch‚Ä¶.AWFUL. 
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie didn't need to be made. Worst thing I've seen in a while
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman and the wasp quantumania is the best marvel movie sence spider man no way Home. Quantumania made me love marvel movies again seeing the movie was an epic cinematic masterpiece this movie is on my top favorite marvel movie list. Seeing antman on the big screen fighting Kang made me love this movie more, Katharine Newton played a very good cassie lang but my favorite was Paul Rudd returning to play antman sence endgame, he was great in this movie I can't wait till avenger the Kang dynasty to see these characters return."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is all over the place, the third act carries the movie in every way. The action is fun but some of the CGI is A BIT wonky but that was to be expected with a marvel movie that was rushed like this one.  The movie was all over the place with a terrible script, Lines that just didn't add up for what was happening.

overall 
5.3/10"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was rad. I'm not sure what the disconnect is, but I enjoyed this immensely. The Quantum Realm was awesome to look at and the natives were interesting. I enjoyed the family dynamic which now includes all of the Pym and Lang folks. Kang was awesome. The movie did not end the way I thought it was going to, which was nice. It's a shame this did not do as well as it should have."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"La historia es buena, usar al personaje de Janet  para darle sentido a todo lo que es el reino cuantico estuvo bien, la presentaci√≥n de Kang es muy poderosa y diferente  a lo que se  habia visto en Loki y  me parece que la estructuraron bien salvo al final que todo fue pasando de manera muy conveniente sin mayor explicaci√≥n y porque si, tampoco me gusto lo que hicieron con MODOK, no me pareci√≥ mal que rescataran al personaje de Darren para eso pero si en que lo convirtieran en una burla a uno de  los personajes mas poderosos de Marvel y que su lucha se viera reducida a un enfrentamiento con Cassie que con unas palabras simples lo hace cambiar de parecer."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely cool and fun movie    the critics are so unreliable
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The cast, awesome! The script was not great at all. With all of these spins offs of MCU movies of the past, I worry about its sustainability. The quality of writing with each movie is just getting worse and worse."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just a mess of a movie. Its a super hero movie, so suspending disbelief is a given, but even the interpersonal relationships are just nonsensical. Jonathan Majors as the big bad seemed to easily defeated after being shown to be incredibly powerful. It was the worst Marvel movie I've seen in a while."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It wasn't as bad as I had been expecting based on some of the reviews.  Yeah, it was the weakest of the Ant Man flicks - Ant Man should be light and fun, and this was none of that - they tried to make Ant Man into an Endgame movie.  The candy colored CGI was awful, and made their shrink powers pointless (there really is no scale reference), The movie has only about 20% Ant Man, and the rest is Ant Family.

That said, while I preferred the daughter from Endgame, this one wasn't horrible.  Yeah, the quantum thing she built was stupid, and she copped an attitude, but her character was multidimensional, and she was positive.  Michelle Pfeiffer was fine in this, although she could have said something, ANYTHING, to let people know what was coming.  The thing with the advanced ants could have worked if they have given it more build up, but nah, they just threw it all in a technicolor vomit blender at the end with Modok and laser head and No Holes... eeesh."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Excuse me‚Äî why is there a 82% on the fans!?? This movie was absolutely TRASH. I don't know why they thought this was a good idea; the mcu is getting worse, same old ending, story and terrible effects. Save your time and watch the Super Mario Movie."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It wasn't bad, but it had its problems. So much of it is just complete randomness. There were so many random CGI characters that felt like some CGI garbage from the Star Wars prequels. It seemed like the Quantum realm was just a bunch of random events and characters thrown together. The writers pretty much had no restrictions because it didn't have to be grounded in reality and it just got too crazy for me. I did, however, really enjoy Jonathan Majors as the villain. Kang was the best part of this movie for me, by far. It was fun to see MODOK in the MCU, but I felt like they could have done better than how they portrayed him. The movie as a whole was decent, but I think the whole Multiverse/Quantum realm stuff is wearing thin and I hope they move away from it sooner than later."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Weak script, but the film is beautiful because of the cgi"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This might be tied with externals as the worst MCU film ever. So many ludicrous plot devises, the daughter ant man kicking ass with no mention of any training, political and social commentary, Kang sucks, too little Paul Rudd and too much of the wasp and daughter (the daughter is especially insufferable), super genius level ants‚Ä¶.I could go on and on. Terrible move ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Unlike the prior AntMan movies, which were fun rides, this one manages to be subpar in every way. Look elsewhere if you want to feel emotions, laughter, or if you like interesting characters in a compelling story-- you'll find none of those things here."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This makes the marvel universe look bleak. Played out ideas so badly wanting to be starwars ad a half baked villain who opens the franchise. It has twenty plus characters and we know no of them. Ever few moments we get new plot device and it moves so fast we stop to care. This is bad, Embarrassing filming and story telling. 

And worst of all this introducing the dangerous president of time travel where anything can be fixed by it. So the stakes completely disappear, and tension. Avoid this like the plague."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved this, no idea why so may people didn't like it, great film! Ignore the haters!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film, full of action, majors made a great kang!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I waited to see this movie due to life happening but honestly not bad. Not the best marvel movie ever but far from the depths of Thor 2 or black widow (which honestly was better than what people were saying but released too late to have the right impact.).
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Muito ruim, a Marvel desaprendeu a fazer s√©ries e filmes ap√≥s vingadores. 
O filme √© deprimente, sem vontade nenhuma de assistir at√© o final. Triste."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"boring, wasn't interested in the activist daughter or the quantum realm."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Hard to make it through. Heroes smirking at Modoc's death, socialist ants, woke daughter damaging police cars‚Ä¶ disposable laser head character. 
Crummy movie, not even worth the torrent effort."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"That was a rough watch! It was the movie that made me think ""I think Im done with Marvel"". And I've been a hardcore fan since Iron Man!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I heard this movie didn't get good reviews from the ""critics"" so I didn't go to see it at the theatres. I watched it yesterday online and was pleasantly surprised. In fact, I enjoyed it very much. Good fun. I regret not seeing this at the theatres as it is visually very well done. Good job on with the bad-guy (good character development)... I hope to see him in other movies. Overall, it's worth watching if you liked the previous Ant-man movies. Compared to what Marvel has been putting out these last few years, this movie is a 10."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie. Was not worthy going to watch it at the theater.
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked it, much more than I thought I would. Lots of fun. I should start ignoring reviews really. I never agree with them ü§£"
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Kinda funny, kinda silly, but at the end takes itself a bit too seriously and is very forgettable."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10, but since so many are judging it too harshly, I am going to give it a 10 out of 10 out of spite. 

This was a fun movie. A bit messy at times but enjoyed the cast."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Slow in the very beginning, great the rest of the way through!"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Though the performances and visuals are nice with some pleasurable moments, Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a hodgepodge of poor writing, tonal inconsistencies and oversaturated ideals that hurdles MCU's phase 5 to a disarray beginning."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just another bad marvel movie
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was a lot better than I expected, and probably better than the 2nd film in the series. Although I do feel that the part of Kang may have been mis-cast as John Majors comes over as too likeable even when he's being evil."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought I just watched a straight to Disney channel special.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is really ""Marvel at their worse"". 
I'm glad that I did not go to the theater to see this. 
Boring story, ugly green screen special effects throughout. Flat jokes, Flat action scenes, Lame dialogues etc‚Ä¶ Kang was very disappointing too by the way. I'm scared for marvel next movies 
Ryan Reynold's Green lantern doesn't look that bad after all compared to recent marvel movies"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a rotten piece of garbage!
What a waste of time!
Jonathan Majors made the movie worthwhile."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In my opinion the movie was a bit meh.Definetly the worst movie in the trilogy.I had to skip through most of  it.The end credit scene kind of made it better,but I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to at first."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,This one is the worst one. 
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What was supposed to be a new magical and unexplored world with the biggest villain of the MCU just became a cheap copy of ""Star Wars"" They even ruined every character in that story. Pretend this movie never existed."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Well another shitty movie. Yes u have actioon etc. but for sake of good end with all good and marvelous films from past. Please stop it.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Such a muddled mess. No tonal consistency. Nothing really at stake. And plenty of ludicrous mistakes made on the part of the main characters.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fucking terrible. One of the worst films I've seen.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I don‚Äôt understand why the media has it out for this movie. It‚Äôs as good as any other Marvel movie. It‚Äôs as if they were setting it up for failure before it was even released. I smell a conspiracy. 
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Aweful script and low budget CGI, the decline of marvel continues rapidly"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good either.  A lot of it was a visual mess.  The cast were fine."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is a lot of fun. Its by no means a masterpiece but id say its the best of the three. The inclusion of modok was done well and was goofy fun.
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Another film with a severely underpowered villain, defeated with little to no effort.
""Hey let's knock this Master of Time, combat and technology and his empire down this weekend. Shouldn't be a problem we can't solve in a few hours.""."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,These movies are all basically the same. Fun cameo in this one though. Whatever. 
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"None of the Ant-Man movies have been particularly great movies, but they always had a pacing and humor that made us overlook the many flaws. Quantumania lacks that and suffers for it.It‚Äôs not bad, but it‚Äôs not good, either. "
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a fun ride and I thought it was better than the first Antman and Wasp movie. This was a solid entry and a great start to Phase 5. I did miss Michael Pena's Luis, but this was a great movie with a good story. Not sure why some say it's storyline was a mess."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Effects were awesome and so was Jonathan Majors' acting.  Otherwise, just another in a series of clich√© Marvel storylines.  I miss having a more complex villain like Thanos... it makes the movie a lot more interesting if the antagonist is more than just a ""bad guy for the good guys to beat.""  Give him some reasoning or a tragic backstory that generates some kind of logos for his/her actions.  It feels like there's no stakes, and these days I can only honestly get myself to watch Marvel movies if I'm bored and wanna see some cool effects."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another mixed mess of a Marvel movie. M.O.D.O.K. was possibly the worst villian I've ever seen. Some good humor but a ton of child humor. The villian was super serious, and generally good, but clashed with the vibe of the rest of the movie. CG was mid at best and there was way too much. It looked like a screen 75% of the movie."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Pretty good I like it. It was pretty confusing though
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was mid. Everything about it was lukewarm. Besides the CGI and special effects what were utter trash. All in all, the Adventures of Antboy and Waspgirl was a crap-fest. Johnathan Majors, Paul Rudd, and Michael Douglas were the only saving graces."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The beginning of the movie felt extremely rushed, Janet refusing to talk about Kang made little sense as to how that protected anybody, and the movie as a whole was really clich√©. Despite that, this movie isn't the worst, and the visual effects were better off this time around as opposed to some of the other works of the MCU. Plus, big battles are something I can always appreciate (when done correctly)."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it, for me, this movie is one of the best of Marvel, one of those that I want to watch more than once, keep improving Marvel, keep improving Marvel."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As usual, the rotten tomatoes score for a marvel movie is way too high. I wish people would get more critical when leaving a review, and not just give it 5 stars because it's marvel, here is my honest review.

I used to be a marvel fan, would go to every movie and would enjoy it most of the time, I am missing the days when ""Thor the dark world"" was the worst marvel movie. After endgame, the quality of the movies and shows just dropped significantly. Marvel movies used to get me excited but now they are just there when I am really bored and I have my kids around me. And that's exactly what Ant-Man 3 is, filling of time. The movie was okay, the CGI looked bad again, as is expected of modern marvel movies, the writing was also pretty terrible, the only reason there is a villain in this movie is because Ant-Man's daughter made something behind his and Janet her back, why would you leave out Janet, the person who has lived in the quantum verse and by far has the most knowledge about it. Marvel shouldn't get away with such lazy writing, but they do of course, because just like Star Wars, the fans don't care as long as they get new content every month. 

No offense to the actors and the acting, they were great, the writing and dialogue was just laughable, and not in the good way. M.O.D.O.K was awful, and he only needed to hear ""Don't be a dick"" to have a redemption arc. And shouldn't he be able to defeat an SJW teenager without any training?

There were some funny parts, but nothing to re-watch. The end battle wasn't exciting and felt rushed. And it was pretty cringe, to be honest.

Overall I haven't seen anything good from marvel since no way home, and before that endgame. I just wished marvel would learn from their mistakes, but they don't and they will keep producing this trash because marvel fans keep watching it. Stop spending your money on marvel and maybe they learn,"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst marvel movie ever
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring and the CGI looks really bad.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The subpar visuals and bad writing make this movie mediocre at best.  It tries to keep the tone too light and there doesn't feel like there are any stakes at all.  Kang is the best part of the movie, with a very good performance coming from Jonathan Majors, but even he is not great.  He is built up only to feel weak and useless.  He just didn't belong with this movie, and it's overly light tone."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,The writing was horrible. The jokes didn't land and it drug on forever. The editing was atrocious and even the acting (and I like most of them usually!) was subpar. I'm kind of shocked to see the 47% it's been given. I would think 25% is more accurate.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,This this was bad. I don‚Äôt understand how the marvel universe used to be so good and now everything is awful.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are almost always wrong. This was a step up from the Second film and leaves you wanting to see where we are going in the MCU cant wait for what is next this set the bar high
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Solid outing. Not as good as the last 2 but still worth your time.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,So much going on with such a waste of talent. I love Paul Rudd but even he couldn't save this movie.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not the best MCU film but still enjoyable. Paul Rudd was awesome and the rest of the cast was great (happy to see Chidi from The Good Place!). Some things didn't work for me, but would be spoilers if I listed them. Still, a nice escape for a couple hours."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pointless from beginning to end. Lacks all the charm of the first two Ant-man movies. Paul Rudd deserved better.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great! Always love Paul Rudd and the number one Catwoman Michelle Pfeiffer! Honestly I don't get all the bad reviews. It was fun and entertaining. Not as good as Guardians 3 but still very enjoyable.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's not bad, but it didn't reach the height I expected, they could have done something much more interesting, to leverage the Multiverse Saga."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is better then the most recent MCU releases, but this is just ok at best. I really preferred Emma Fuhrmann as Cassandra, Kathyrn Newton was a huge step backwards in this role. Fuhrmann should not have been recast."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"My family and I truly enjoyed this movie. It helped that I had watched Loki, so I knew Kangs back story. It's been decades since I have read the comics, but I enjoy the lightness of Marvel this Phase. It's a nice contrast to the heavy of Star Wars."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a fun adventure, movie a little movie with a big adventure"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Story was not well developed. Should have been a Disney series. Too many inconsistencies. Kang is too powerful for Antman and Wasp to defeat him. Movie was horrible.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dosyƒá md≈Çy. Bardzo s≈Çabo poprowadzona fabu≈Ça i nienaturalne dialogi. Niezbyt ciekawe postacie i przeciƒôtna gra aktorska. Takie sobie CGI
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie has some entertaining parts but mostly felt boring or cringy throughout the middle of the movie. But overall its not a bad or great movie. Its an average one that people should watch if they really need to know more about Kang.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Are Marvel standards this low? 
You normally have people checking the script of movies right? Sigh, lets begin with a point by point of why this movie does not make you feel anything, and why it does not work.

Overall, this movie feels like a cluster of cringe dialog, forced acting, and like the actors are in front of a green screen throughout the whole movie, not really inside of the action happening inside the film.
How can a movie like Ant-Man 1, with its funny moments and new things brought to the table fall so low? 

First off, why does the dialog have to be so cringy? Seems like we are watching a kids show (think Dora the Explorer) instead of a movie. Also why the cringe family interactions? 

Secondly, Cassie Lang, with no background of her skills: We don't know her pastimes, if she's been to college, etc. Just by reading some books she was able to create a satellite to the quantum realm? Really? We don't see any progress or her failures or what it took to get there? She didn't burn her hands soldering or any accidents? Seems too rushed. 

And again, something has to go wrong for the movie to occur. In this case, it was the telescope beaming everyone into it. At least this time Janet Van Dyne (Overly secretive grandma) yanked the cables and it didn't happen out of nowhere. 

Janet Van Dyne. Ohh where to start. This character comes off as a secretive kid. Bad acting, stereotypical nervousness with her body language, not taking the time to share information with her family because 'she's got better things to do and now's not the time'. Then a typical, overly recycled interaction where Hank, Janet and Wasp bump into some desert raiders and they fight, only to break the silence with laughter since they knew each other before. Ugh, you can do better Marvel. 
She's also very out of place and giving useless information. ""Oh, that ship right there, it's like flying a bicycle"", yeah, like if he would know. Or ""It's like stuffing a turkey"", Jesus Christ, please deliver us from those cringy lines.

Conveniently through all the way down into the quantum realm, nobody bumps into anything? Really? It just so happened that the very very slim chance of everyone falling through a perfect hole (when they didn't have a suit) until they reach the floor? 

And when they entered the quantum real, had you gone to the bathroom, you wouldn't have noticed they were in a different universe. The movie's colors look the same, neither of them react to try and inspect the floor or the new temperature of the environment. It just screams hey, we're in front of a green screen and that's it.

When the ships where attacking the refugee base, this was the worst of it all. Ant-Man was really, just running? He could've gone small and knocked out most of the guys there no problem. But instead, he ran scared and even hid under a small trench. And conveniently, only when dozens of people have died, does Cassie conveniently put on her suit and decide to start fighting, like 10 minutes after the fight begun. It feels like they were doing things just for the camera, that isn't how real heroes would act.
And one more thing, in that same scene, Cassie fails to hit a guy and she ends on the floor. Then for the next 4 minutes, Ant-Man and Cassie talk and he shows her how to attack. All the while no bullet hits them, no enemy tries to go at them, and they aren't even looking around. Come on, you're in the middle of a firefight and you don't even look for cover or scan your surroundings? Very very bad acting and direction. 
Also, why is it that conveniently, since it was shown at the beginning that Cassie helps refugees and such, that she lands close and eventually is lead to the refugees? Wouldn't it have been a more interesting character ark if she and Ant-Man land with Kang, and he brain-washes her into his ways? Would she have known him as the bad guy or not? Because she was readily eager to help the refugees without knowing any of them. Like really, without enough context how can you tell who's good and who's bad? Cassie is extremely easy to manipulate.

Lastly, to prove my ""Camera Protection"" theory. In their final fight, Wasp comes to rescue Ant-Man, Wasp begins to shoot Kang, acting like if it was such a hassle to shoot from her suit. I'm pretty sure she had to have more than 30 rounds in her suit still, and she proceeds to just fire 1 every second to Kang. She could've literally bombarded Kang, flown to Ant-Man, and return to the portal in like 3 seconds saving them and leaving Kang behind, but no. Then they push Kang into the battery, and when he's done for, they proceed to just stare at him for a good 5 secs, and only then does the portal behind them close. Such a scripted scene. Nobody would act like that in real life unless they were very very dumb.

There are also a lot of scenes that are empty and without any filling. There's a scene where Janet is driving the spaceship, and they cruise around a mega city without speaking. Like really? If that was real life, Hank would probably comment on the amazing advancement of the underground civilization, or Cassie would ask her why she hid this advanced civilization from them, etc.
Also another scene where Hank asks the bartender for a drink that can get him drunk. But for the next 6 or 7 minutes of that scene, there is not follow up for the drink. If this was real life, he'd probably yell 'Hey, when's that drink coming up'? Or he'd ask to have the drink before they take them to jail at least, as a joke or whatever. But nothing. Just a random line of dialogue thrown in there with no relevancy or continuity. 

One more thing, isn't the subject brought up that Jane left everyone there to die? Nobody stands up to tell her that was wrong. She is 'excused' just because she is part of the family, what a cheap dialogue and story."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"muy plana, la trama daba para mucho, y en el trailer promet{ia mucho, aunque no sabria explicar ese algo m√°s por el que no me gust√≥, porque de por si ant man es uno de mis personajes favoritos y las 2 primeras me encantaron, y esta, la verdad crei que ser√≠a mejor pero resulto demasiado mala"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, lots of humour like the previous films in the series. Special effects were good. Wasn't sure I'd like it as I didn't like the Kang character in Loki, but was actually decent."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wanted to like this movie so much. The idea of a quantum realm is very clever and I love the Marvel movies so much, even the ones that are not highly reviewed. Unfortunately this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. The main villain can see all time and space, but somehow doesn‚Äôt see this ending. I could write negatively about the entire movie but I‚Äôll save you. Don‚Äôt waste your time on this one."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The CGI is mostly terrible, the plot is nonsensical and rushed even if the movie is not short at all...Kang shows something decent but is way worse than the one we saw in Loki (even if he's not the same Kang)."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie! Just as much fun as the previous two. I really don't understand critics complaining about it. It was way better than Wakanda Forever, which took itself much too seriously. Additionally, I didn't find the humor flat at all, as some critics and others have stated.

There have been some complaints about Kang not being fleshed out, or having a background. Clearly, these people have not watched the Loki series. Gives the whole thing some context. Which is fantastic that the tv serieses, apparently, will have some lasting impact MCU, and just be throwaways.

All in all definately one of the better MCU movies, possibly as good as a couple of the avenger movies."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Let's roll the Quantinum..
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It had a Star Wise universe type vibe that made it a little interesting for a while. Then a pretty hilarious scene towards the very end. But a lot of formulaic ""seen it too many times before"" sandwiched in between."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I would recommend this movie! How ever it's pacing is done poorly and for some it may be a bit hard to follow, also their was the design of M.O.D.O.K which was bad but I never held high hopes for his design on the big screen. Other wise it had good cgi and decent plot had good jokes and was I had a fun time watching. Overall it's not the best marvel has put out but is still pretty good."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Disappointing and not up to the Marvel standards. Star Wars rip-off. I did enjoy Bill Murray.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible script, terrible green screen work, even Paul Rudd's humor flopped in this film. Honest opinion, don't waste your time with it, it's not worth it coming from a fan of everything Paul Rudd."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyable, but as much as this pains me to say it, the MCU needs to get back to having fun. This latest phase has been a slog fest."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Estuvo buena pero hay algo que no me encanto
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was very bored most of the time waiting for something interesting to happen, but it wasn't until the very end of the movie when everything got excited, but the weirdest thing was that floating head so cringe!"

"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Uninspired and hugely derivative, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania never walks its own path of creativity, always lost in it's overworked franchise plot filled with smug humour."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The worst Marvel film yet. It's terribly written, looks awful and has no impact on the rest of the universe. The jokes aren't funny and the action is boring, Jonathan Majors is the only bright spot in the film. Kevin Feige should be ashamed of this."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a dad you will love it (and a mum), because it speaks to that absolute protectionism you feel. The multiverse (as we keep hearing) is ever exploring . This movie takes you there in spades with the every charming Mr. Rudd!"

"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not what I was expecting underwhelming to say the least. A few good scenes Paul Rudd was hilarious as always but not enough to pull the movie out I like the big headed dude he was pretty funny.
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"SPOILERS- Not as bad as people are making it out to be. Sure, there is some obvious green screen, however it isn't as bad as some other Marvel projects. My main issue with it is pacing. I wish it took more time to develop the relationships between Cassie and the rest of the family and also took more time to introduce the new characters. To really develop a sense of disappointment when their community gets destroyed. They also keep on changing the tone from serious to comedic too quickly. In my opinion, none of the Marvel jokes in any of the movies have been funny enough for me to laugh at, however that's as someone who doesn't laugh jokes easily. So I don't see why people are being so critical. The jokes were entertaining however not timed properly and not executed as well as they could've been. The action sequences looked really good in my opinion and the villains were also very interesting. The relationship between Kang and Janet was one of my favourite parts even though it wasn't fully developed. Kang was a great villain, his motivations were excellently depicted and every scene he was in was very enjoyable. Overall, the movie was pretty good and I would watch it again."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The villain shined when he was on screen; everything else was forgettable. Mindless fun, though, but it does not raise the bar on anything special."

"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's not that bad, but it's no good either."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Had its funny moments but lacked any meaning and fell flat on its face at the end. Kang could have been an amazing villain but was poorly written and hap hazardly put together.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a third best entry of Antman I love it with a very great simple way the third part gives a lighthearted story nd plots nd also Cassie become antgirl lso great nd whole thrilling family fun we watch this nd the first magnificent spectacular live action debut of The legendary Kang The Conqueror with great xplore of Mr major can't wait to see him again epic adventure all time ‚ô•Ô∏èüëèüëåüåüüëåüòÉ
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"After all the negative hype, especially from critics who tend to be illiterate on comic lore, I saw this film and found it to be very entertaining with a solid set up for the bigger narrative coming to the Marvel-verse. The story was engaging, not generic, and had a nice pace throughout. My whole family watched it and everyone was fully engaged throughout the whole film. And for all the talk of bad effects, I thought they were excellent. There was nothing fake looking about them. If you like Guardians and Endgame, then you should be well conditioned for this film. Solid movie and an easy rewatch."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Had really high expectations for this film kicking of Phase 5, didn't feel that it delivered on any of the hype at all. Really enjoyed the first two Ant-Mans but this one just wasn't it. 2/5"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved this movie. Thought it did a good job explaining and developing Kang, and the multiverse."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It seems like they tried to play on humor similar to Thor Love & Thunder, but failed miserabely. This is some of the dumbest stuff I have ever seen in the Marvel universe."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Great actors gone waste. A ton of cgi, with a hint of a story, and sprinkles of dialogue. Couple of one-liners. Easily worst of the Ant-man movies."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Couldn't stick to the seat. First half is just completely boring. Same old story. A prodigy saying all the fancy things and the suspens is not even worth any attention.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A little more realism about the daughters ability, and some actual excitement when it came to fighting back would be appreciated"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,It looked like it was filmed entirely with a green screen behind... Story was weak.. Just boring
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's pretty boring. Comic book movies are dead
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The biggest letdown of the Post-Endgame MCU movies or shows.  There have been worse products so far (Hawkeye, She-Hulk), but I was expecting so much more from this movie, especially for it kicking off Phase 5 and being the first movie with Kang as the antagonist.  

First off, the movie is a green-screen nightmare.  The visuals in the quantum realm are equally distracting and dull, and don't draw you into the story.  The absolutely ridiculous way the plot gets started, and the implausible reasons as to why Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) would not have shared her interactions with Kang make no sense.  Speaking of that, there are so many things in this film that make no sense.  How did Ant-Man spend five years in the quantum realm and never come across Kang?  If Kang is such a technological genius why couldn't he create some level of shrinking tech to help himself in all of this time?  Why does Kang want to conquer a realm that he wishes to escape?  

Secondly, the humor is just super cringe.  I think I snickered once during the movie, but never laughed.  Most of the time I just rolled my eyes or sighed at the sad attempts at comedy.  They say that writing would be ruined by AI, but after this I am pretty certain some AI programs could do better than this.  

I have to make a special mention of M.O.D.O.K., who will go down as one of the worst MCU characters of all time.  He adds nothing of value, is as funny as stubbing your toe, and in the third act he flips his alliance on a dime based on an insult.  Just an abomination.  

The shame of this is that Michelle Pfeiffer and Johnathan Majors seemed to be trying hard to make something work here.  Kang was both intimidating and strong (up until the last five minutes).  It's a shame they were in such a train wreck. 

To add insult to injury, (minor spoiler); the events of the movie really don't impact the MCU as a whole at all.  You can skip this one (I highly recommend you do) and not miss anything important in the overall MCU narrative."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,another average Disney movie
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man cannot save this movie.

Director Peyton Reed's superhero sci-fi adventure Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) is a massive disappointment. I loved Ant-Man as well as Ant-Man and the Wasp for their hilarious humor, grounded charming characters, and quaint small scale sci-fi stories. Quantumania is large scale sci-fi nonsense that introduces Kang the Conqueror as Ant-Man's latest villain in a movie too big to matter. I did not care about any of the characters or this alien rebellion garbage that just ripped off Star Wars. Peyton Reed's direction loses all the charm, humor, excitement, and creative flair that made the first two Ant-Man movies so fun to watch. This is a complete slog at 125 minutes, but feels like it is 4 hours long. Quantumania is confusing, boring, slow, unfunny, ugly, and a waste of talent and our time.

Marvel movies really suck now. Producer Kevin Feige must be stopped as a $200 million budgeted movie looks like this cost $50. The hideous CGI looks worse than Spy Kids. The lighting is heinously bad as you can barely make anything out. The visual effects look rushed and overindulgent as I kept thinking Quantumania looks remarkably similar to John Carter. Feige has even ruined Ant-Man now. Writer Jeff Loveness' jokes are cringe inducing and never funny. His quantum realm story with Kang is so dull and unimaginative. All the sci-fi jargon is lost on me and I don't even care at all. I cannot imagine that Stan Lee or Jack Kirby would have enjoyed this humorless mess or forgettable narrative.

Paul Rudd is really boring this time as Scott Lang as he only cares about his daughter suddenly. His Ant-Man is super boring and weak this time to make others seem more important. Evangeline Lilly hardly has any lines as Hope van Dyne with no personality. Her Wasp gets to do nothing. She should have had more scenes with Rudd like are they not a couple?

Jonathan Majors tries hard as Kang the Conqueror, but he's not intimidating as all his dialogue is about potential universes and timelines, so I could care less. Kang gets his butt kicked by Ant-Man and his insect friends, so why would he ever be an intimidating villain against all of the Avengers.

Kathryn Newton is fine as Ant-Man's teenaged daughter Cassie Lang. I guess it's fine that she's a social justice warrior, but she feels underwritten and immature with not much to do compared to Ant-Man. Not sure why she was recast from Abby Ryder Fortson and Emma Fuhrmann.

David Dastmalchian provides a goofy voice for the pink slime creature Veb. Katy O'Brian is terrible as the alien rebel Jentorra, she's like a Star Trek creature. William Jackson Harper's irritable telepath Quaz is irritating. Bill Murray looks like the check cleared in his phoned in performance as Lord Krylar.

Michelle Pfeiffer hopefully got paid bank to portray the original Wasp superheroine Janet van Dyne. I did not care for the fact that she cannot warn Ant-Man and the others about Kang because she declares there's not time. Michael Douglas also gets wasted besides a few cute moments with his ants as the original Ant-Man, Hank Pym. What a shame to waste Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas because they're legendary actors at this point.

Corey Stoll is horrible as a misguided Darren Cross, now called M.O.D.O.K. His CGI floating head looks horrendously cheap like a flying Humpty Dumpty egg. The post credits scene Kangs are the only worse looking CGI in Quantumania.

Editors Adam Gerstel and Laura Jennings have obnoxious over-cutting tendencies. Bill Pope's cinematography looks awful with bad lighting, awkward framing, and indecipherable visuals. It should have been more character focused to let us see the actors for some more emotion rather than an endless bog of ugly CGI. Will Htay's production design rips off Star Wars and John Carter for these ugly CGI places.

Composer Christophe Beck sounds derivative and forgettable with overly sentimental melodies. The sound design team really used too many stock sounding noises. Costume designers Sammy Sheldon and Nicole Young could have used more vibrant colors on all the outfits to make people stand out more among the slush of CGI. Makeup artists Jan Sewell and Louise Young's makeup is ugly and amateur at best. The wigs and hairstyling from Jan Sewell look so bad and ridiculous, especially for Evangeline Lilly. At least Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton's hair is not messed up terribly.

In short, skip Quantumania and just watch the first two Ant-Man movies for some fun. I think I'm done with Marvel movies."

"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie was just ok. The whole Quantum Realm storyline is just uninteresting. The humor was kind of lacking. On the positive side, Jonathan Majors was amazing! Unfortunately, Disney and Marvel still haven't been able to bring back the original magic of the MCU."
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"No esta a la altura de las primera peliculas de Marvel, pero si es muy entretenida y esta dentro de las mejores de la ultima fase, recomendada para una tarde palomera."

"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Woof, that was a hard watch. Formulaic, tons of colorful space CGI (used as a positive in other reviews‚Ä¶ whaaaa‚Ä¶?,) and a plot that simply isn't. I do agree, J Majors was terrific, but I was pretty nonplussed by the three Kang‚Ä¶ leaders? that are coming. Very very meh."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,modok is the best character and nobody can disagree with me
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ap√≥s anos utilizando da mesma f√≥rmula para os seus filmes, a Fase 5 da Marvel Studios se inicia com aquilo que h√° de pior nessa f√≥rmula, recheado de clich√™s, solu√ß√µes baratas e gen√©ricas, p√©ssimo desenvolvimento de personagens, trama confusa e um roteiro desprez√≠vel, Quantumania consegue ser o pior filme da Marvel, possuindo apenas 3 qualidades: Atua√ß√£o de Jonathan Majors, bons efeitos visuais e uma fotografia bonita. A hist√≥ria do filme √© t√£o furada que √© digna de risadas por tantas id√©ias rid√≠culas e mal estruturadas, deixando o espectador com um gosto amargo, e com a terr√≠vel sensa√ß√£o de perda de tempo."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It seemed like a wasted use of a major bad guy like Kang in Ant-Man and Wasp movie. Ant-Man and Wasp just aren't very interesting heroes, as portrayed in the MCU. I found it hard to get myself excited for this movie pre-release and actually watching it didn't leave me any more excited. Please retire this duo of uninspiring heroes."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Adored the other movies but this was all spectacle with no thought. It reminds me of Wonder Woman 1984 and not in a good way.
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly i thought it would be like the first or even seco nd one, but was a bit none sense marvel is losing it. I didn‚Äôt like it . Sorry poor jokes. "
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible plot. where are we going from this?
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it.  Also got my Dad to watch it.  Love all the characters.  Great stuff.
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was okay, just okay."
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The script is not great. It was pretty boring. I kept pausing it. The entire universe is CGI and isn't interesting. Not sure if this movie necessary at all, it didn't really advance anything in the MCU."
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,N√£o foi t√£o mal quanto falaram
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is An Absolutely amazing movie, and you may say some parts of the story may be a bit rough on some edges however It is really just an awesome watch and you will have loads of fun"
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's fine. A lot of work from creatives obviously went into this production, so I am reluctant to be too critical. Not Top 10 Marvel, but a reasonable sci-fi adventure film, that leaves you hoping that maybe something epic may be down the road."
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"By≈Ç taki wielki hype na to, a film okaza≈Ç siƒô do≈õƒá przeciƒôtny niestety - warto sobie raz obejrzeƒá, ale sza≈Çu nie ma"
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love the Marvel movies. I love how they brought back some of the villains and how it's connecting with the other movies and series, but this was just sitting between meh and awful. It was written too much with puns and a comedy with bad acting. The only empowering female characters I saw were Janet and Hope, the others were just horrible acting. The fighting techniques were not scripted well, the CGI made everyone stand out like a sore thumb, and like some of the other last Marvel movies, it was rushed to get to the end with so many cringe parts I wanted to stop watching multiple times. We need to get Jon Favreau to direct more and some of these actresses need to either practice more or go back to acting school; there's no passion from the heart in these actors and actresses anymore. I saw better acting and fighting choreography from Michelle's character than from Katy M. O'Brian, who is supposed to be a martial artist (supposed to be good at punching and pulling back/withholding power) and an actress. As someone who is also a martial artist and theater actress, I'm appalled by her lack of passion to act with her heart as well as her lame punching, kicking, and all fighting techniques that don't require a long weapon. A Multiverse of thumbs down for this movie."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just horrible ! Campy plot dumb humor and tired old actors with a young amber heard look a like . 
No imagination or originality . 
Barely got through it !"
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"spoilers,In a way this movie reminds me of the Multiverse of madness as it's called Quantumania mania madness, Multiverse quantum I don't know there are other similarities is they both start off at a neck brake speed these films are not messing around and just throw you in and they're both mixed films amongs fans this is as much as Janets movie as it is 
Ant man's movie. Probably even more I've heard a lot of comparisons to Star Wars and I do see it it's not really a bad thing and some of the weird factors are pretty cool not all the comedy works but there's a few good specs of comedy throughout kang is amazing and I would love to see him more. I know kang dynasty very excited the CGI is very hit or miss. Most of it doesnt work, and there is very odd uses of it to be honest. I don't mind Modok that much. He was kinda funny but I think it would've been better if he wasn't in it, I don't think he added anything to the plot, same as with Bill Murray very wasted in the film, thought there kind of been something bigger, but nope I don't want to be that guy but I am but just imagine the impact this movie would have if hank died like I don't want that to happen, but just imagine people walking out of the theaters like that just happened to make kang feel like a real threat. That would be epic and sad at the same time, because nobody wants to see Hank die, except for the actor himself but if they were ballsy enough to do it that would be insane but they didn't and I guess that's OK but Seriously Hank dose nothing in the film kill him of and Michael Douglas doesnt even want to be in the series anymore so what bruh The movie is a pretty mixed bag for me like I was really sad to see Luis not show up because he has some of the best parts of the first two even the sequel which I don't like as much but I don't really see how he would fit in this film and to be honest I really didn't dig this film as much as I wanted to and I'm glad I watched it on streaming instead of going in theaters, I had plans to watch it in the theaters but ultimately didn't go so I'm glad I waited because this movie didn't really do it for me as much I a thought and it's probably my least favorite MCU film its  terrible a terrible MCU film I mean not yet so quanta mania in my opinion was terrible Kang was pretty good but killing him of like that was stupid and everything else feels like a huge CGI fest and I didn't really enjoy it as much as I think I should've pretty disappointing, and could have been way better so like an actual terrible MCU film 2/10"
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Much better than what the so-called critics thought. Felt fresh and a worthy antagonist. Great action and a resolution that was earned. This group-think by critics is so obvious sometimes. It seems they are afraid to disagree with each other. In the end, this was a thoroughly entertaining movie."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thought it was a great film! Fun, funny and enjoyable to watch!"
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie's good but no need to rewatch it.
I think is a nice story with certain funny moments. CGI is not that bad at least but it's definitely not the greatest Marvel movie nor the best ant-man movie."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Me pareci√≥ demasiado cgi, por momentos me aburr√≠a much√≠simo. Todos tienen trajes, todos tienen poderes, no se siente nada especial. Es como una copia de Star wars sin chispa."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this was great movie! Waited so long because it was being portrayed as sub-par (my fault for listening) and compared to the new Thor as far as missing the mark. Not the case. CGI wasn't up to Marvel standards but still good. Kang as a villian seems a little soft coming off Thanos but we'll see how that all plays out. Definitely worth watching!
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania tiene como un tipo parecido a las pel√≠culas de Star Wars no est√° mal  esta entretenida
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"After watching this tonight on Disney, I'm surprised by the low critic review scores. I enjoyed this movie much more than Black Panther 2, and more than Thor: Love and Thunder. The best MCU movie? No. But far from the worst. I thought it was above average to good."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This has to be the most weirdest movie I‚Äôve ever seen, sorry Peyton but this movie sucks"
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Otimo filme. Bem na medida.
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Totally lost film, with poorly written villains. not to mention that it has several terrible pick up line."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,GAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRBAAAAAAAAAAAGE
"May 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"No est√° mal, para mi es la mejor pel√≠cula de la trilog√≠a de ant-man y no entiendo las malas cr√≠ticas que tiene esta pel√≠cula, tendr√° sus cosas negativas pero para nada es peor que Thor 2, the Eternals o capitana Marvel."
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,La verdad est√° pel√≠cula inicia de gran manera la fase 5 del ucm espero m√°s de la actuaci√≥n de Jhonatan major por qu√© si actuaci√≥n en esta pel√≠cula me encant√≥
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a good movie, a little goofy. Kind of brought down a great Kang performance. MODOK was completely goofy."
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Achei meia boca, mundo feio, td escuro e borrado, personagens pareciam plagiado de star wars. N√£o vale o replay."
"May 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I didn't think Quantumania was as terrible as everyone made it out to be.  Not great, but not the abomination everyone made it out to be.  Maybe they cleaned up the CG before the D+ release today?"
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Struggling to get through it.  It's looking a lot like Star Wars, but on a basement table.  I guess it's lucky that Kang just happened to be in their basement the whole time?"
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm actually surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. From the trailers and critical reception I thought I was going to bounce off this one but I actually enjoyed it more than some of the other recent Marvel outings. It wasn't especially heavyweight or anything but it was very entertaining and the cast were insanely charming and made it hard not to get swept up in the silliness. The elephant in the room is obviously Kang played by Jonathan Majors, he's a terrific actor but is currently shrouded in controversy which leaves a lot of question marks over his future as the character. I know better than to jump to conclusions about these sorts of situations but it does make things feel a bit weird. 

All in all, I feel like the critics might have been a bit harsh on this one. It's not doing any heavy lifting narratively but it's very entertaining and doesn't do much to make you dislike it. I wasn't even as distracted by the copious use of CGI sets either, the CGI was actually fairly decent in this one and the vibrant backdrops were nice eye candy. 

I'd say give this a watch if you want something to entertain you for a few hours and don't want to have to think too hard."
"May 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a film that doesn't feel like a Marvel movie, in fact, it feels more like a Star-Wars movie. But once you look past the imperfections, the best visuals of the trilogy mixed with the villain of Kang make it an entertaining watch.

Rating: 66% üçÖ"
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man & the Wasp Quantumania. Review.

Comienzo diciendo para los gustos los colores y aqui en esta 3ra entrega de Antman no falta para nada, Green Screen o la nueva tecnologia usada en The Mandalorian series de Star Wars son lo que mas sobresale en lo que es una de las peliculas mas malas de el MCU, el gui√≥n, los personajes y los villanos para mis gustos sent√≠ que fracasason, dandole oportunidad a Kang ya que los que sabemos no es su ""Final Form"" presentado en Loki o en Quantumania. Ese Fear factor que un villano representa en un filme no lo senti en la sala del cine, M.O.D.O.K. fue uno de estos personajes que pocos conocen y se hacen pasar por sabiondos a la hora de comentar sobre el, si me quiero ir mas a fondo en el videojuego Avengers el era mega poderoso y es el Final Boss de el juego, aqui lo que hicieron fue masacrar al personaje de una manera indescriptible.

Sin importar las opiniones mixtas sobre la pelicula esta es la mia, fue decepcionante, sin coraz√≥n y ese sentido de direcci√≥n no fue lo clave en este filme que en vez de llamarse Antman and the Wasp tenia que llamarse Janet Van Dyne & Kang. Antman, Wasp y el personaje irrelevante de Cassie Lang, lo cual la vemos con su nuevo traje creado por Hank y ella misma no lleva nombre y practicamente no tiene nada emocionante que pueda crecer o disminuir su tama√±o,  estos personajes caen a segundo plano y se concentran mas en la historia de Janet (Pfeiffer) dentro de el mundo quantico de Galaxy Quest.. vacilando... En la realidad MCU en estos momentos se estan concentrando en comedia, personajes sanganos al estilo de James Gunn.

Quantumania carece de ese it factor de momentos epicos en el filme, si se ve super bien los efectos especiales y el sonido es super bueno, la Fase 5 entiendo que pudo comenzar mucho mejor ya que Antman es un tremendo personaje del cual comenz√≥ con una tremenda formula de acci√≥n y comedia en la primera, aqui se concentraron en darnos personajes alienijenas con dialogos charrisimos en momentos serios de la pelicula, la historia fue mas tema tiempo.

Cassie y Scott no tuvieron contacto por varios a√±os mientras que Kang crea su imperio dentro de el mundo Quantico destruyendo en multiples universos su propia versi√≥n proclamandose el conquistador de universos Kang, Jonathan Majors luce espectacular, en parte es temerario, Kevin Feige no debio de abrir la boca en decir que el Kang que veremos en Quantimania es peor que Thanos, maybe ese fue el error en decirlo creando ese hype que nadie sintio en mi sala de cines, solo risas bobas en los dialogos y solo un momento a final de el filme que fue buenisimo con las hormigas, trate de disfrutarme la pelicula con. Buena actitud pero cuando veia la direcci√≥n senti que la estaba dirigiendo el mismo que hizo She/Hulk.

La historia de Janet y Kang son el fuerte del filme viendo un Bill Murray en uno de los peores papeles de una estrella ochentosa a escojido al igual que Kurt Russell como Ego en Guardians 2, su personaje fue totalmente innecesario y espero que no vuelva a salir mas, Quantumania hace lucir a Lov and Thunder como un filme digno de ver multiples veces, muchos estaran en desacuerdo conmigo pero ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è nunca les dije que no la vieran o se la disfruten, estoy siendo objetivo.

En fin si veremos a Kang mas a menudo en lo que es el comienzo de The Multiverse Saga, solo dos series llegar√°n este a√±o con Loki y Secret Invasion para luego llegar√° The Marvels con Kamala Khan, Carol Danvers y Monica Rambeau (Ms. Marvel,Captain Marvel & Proton). El final de Quantumania abre mas puertas a la historia de The Conqueror Kang y les puedo decir que estar√© entusiasmado con ver como este personaje evoluciona, dejare mi f√© a ver si en proximos projectos sinceramente llena mis espectativas con uno de los personajes villanos mas viejos de Marvel y estamos hablando que este personaje es de los 60's.

En definici√≤n para mis gustos y lo que me esperaba de este filme no llen√≥ mis espectativas como un comienzo de fase en lo que es Marvel Studios.TIENE DOS ESCENAS POS-CREDITS.

Clasificada D
6.5/10 Bad!"
"May 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,An absolute CGI mess that is mostly saved by a gravitas performance from Majors appropriate for Marvel's new Conqueror and unexpectedly badass and heroically committed performance from Michelle Pheiffer.
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"√â uma pena um filme super bem feito ter em enredo t√£o fumbrega...nada faz muito sentido por aqui.
Totalmente aleat√≥rio....coisas que n√£o convencem. √â uma pena."
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"not good, jonathan majors like, hit someone"
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Who in their right mind could even consider this a good movie. CGI crap, and its not even well made."
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow. I wanted to like this. Acting is poor, especially Michelle Pfeiffer and Paul Rudd. It's hard to describe, but almost soap opera like with her and just unbelievable with Paul Rudd. Emotions seem non-existent with him, especially scenes with Kathryn Newton, who's playing his daughter. Almost campy characters like MODOK. And I don't think there's super hero movie fatigue; we're waiting for good stories. And, can we please leave the quantum realm and the multiverse behind??  It's too much, and in almost every movie lately, from this to Flash, to Spider-Man, to Doctor Strange and on and on and on. Enough already."
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"N√£o √© preciso muito para me agradar com um filme, ent√£o n√£o me surpreendo de ter gostado deste, indo na mar√© contr√°ria de muitos. Por√©m, √© um filme esquec√≠vel, sem grande utilidade. Em uma semana pouca coisa se prendeu na minha mem√≥ria."
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Filme muito bom! Amei!
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Massive waste of money. Wasted hours of millions of people's lives. Sad.
"May 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As far as Avengers movies go it's a meh ü´§. Nothing special but nothing really bad. I do wonder why so many characters that wear helmets are constantly taking them off. Even in the middle of battle they are taking them off. The movie did miss some really exciting parts where Scott could have actually been wrote like a real father. 
The newer marvel movies are getting so paint by numbers I actually find myself starting to zone out and doze. 
It's a classic paint by numbers marvel movie. I would recommend watching it if you can do it with out paying actual extra money."
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I know the writers are on strike but woof! That was bad.
Save your time, skip the first 50 minutes of diatribe. Michelle Pfeiffer brings nothing to this movie and Bill Murray serves no purpose either. 
More unnecessary casual swearing than actual dialogue.
Beautiful CGI! Very journey to the centre of the earth meets that StarWars episode with JarJar Binks."
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The effects, setting and characters reminded me a little too much of Shark Boy and Lava Girl. Overall seemed a little pointless other than the introduction of the new villain who holds up the film. Marvel need to lift"
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I've been watching marvel movies for as long as I can remember. From what I've heard people aren't a fan. The cgi was well done even though others say it was crap due to the look of modok but come on there not much you can do to make a giant head and tiny body look good. Would've been cool if they kept the same actor for Cassie but that's just something minor. The other actor probably had stuff going on. Overall I like how it connects in with loki series. Will be interesting to see where it heads to next.
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Awful awful üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©
"May 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,The lack of creativity and believability of the characters left me somewhat dissatisfied. Some of characthers are presented to be the most brilliant minds. Yet they make such poor choices.
"May 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Just needed more Kang fighting and a little more action in the quantum realm. But great movie.
"May 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Sets looked small and 2 dimensional. The plot itself was not exciting like the previous two entries in this series.
"May 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,What!! This movie is crazy bad. Plus the main villain is not a nice actor.
"May 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"kwantoburdel, jakby kto≈õ po≈ÇƒÖczy≈Ç dwa koncepty na film w jeden w najbardziej nijaki spos√≥b, ale chyba najbardziej szkoda mi zmarnowanej postaci Kanga"
"May 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel running out of Ideas.

Probably the worst entry in the marvel cinematic universe. 
Bad CGI; Bad Acting; Bad floating head Duncan, WTF...

Jonathan Majors as Kang is also forgettable."
"May 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,A fun sci-fi adventure that's great for anyone alike. The plots a bit of a mess but the humor makes up for it.
"May 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Another cliche marvel movie 
"May 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,Better than the 2nd one. 71/100
"May 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It felt a lot like Star Wars. Not that there's anything wrong with Star Wars, but this is a Antman movie. A lot of the jokes were misses. Antman had a lot of plot armor. When kang was killing all those people with his lasers, he shot Antman and he just flew 5 feet. But the movie looked cool, The cgi was amazing, and kang was scary‚Ä¶ well until he got beat up by alot of ants. ""Avenger level threat"""
"May 14, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a great movie theater experience. The story wasn‚Äôt ground breaking but the overall movie was a ton of fun. The movie builds out an interesting world and provides really trippy visuals. I recommend giving it a watch.
"May 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Potentially, a very good film. Some extremely goofball moments undermine the serious character acting done by Majors, Pfeiffer, and Douglas. Mostly the failed Modok scenes... just painful. His ""I am not a dick"" redemption... written by a ten year old? His death played for more cheap laughs, trying to be ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" irreverent? No, doesn't work. Cut those scenes off the reel! Quick!

Two painful woke moments... the anti-police bit at the beginning, and the ""socialism isn't bad"" comment by Douglas. Groan."
"May 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Es una pel√≠cula boba, me sorprendi√≥ lo malo de los efectos especiales, parece una pel√≠cula de hace 10 a√±os, la historia es pobre."
"May 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not perfect but over hated 
"May 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"enjoyed the visuals of the movie. like the design of the setting of the quantum realm.
Murdock looking stupid was great comedic relief and just a joke on this design.
I like this version of Kang but he was too strong for Antman and Wasp to take on.
i feel like this version of kang is someone who can fight all the avengers at the same time and win so it felt weird ant man could keep up with him.
Kang was a great villain and enjoyed the performance"
"May 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I Think it was below good but very high above bad, plots a but messy, cassie was annoying ""dont be a dick"" but overall not bad!!"
"May 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its interesting new addition to MCU! Love the ending, can't Wait to see whats next f√≥r ant man family."
"May 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,One star for Paul Rudd
"May 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not bad... I fel it was really forced... Definitely it is down on my list
"May 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,What are the critics thinking with this one? It's good
"May 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,I know a lot of people weren't happy with this film but I was entertained and never got bored. I love Paul Rudd as Ant Man and I thought it was a good adventure. Plus the visuals were insane.
"May 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,A 4+ is rewatchable. Nothing in this movie makes me want to talk about it or see it again. Paul Rudd is a star and does his part but the rest was forgettable
"May 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Watched in a theater, so seeing it on the big screen didn't help. It was so CGI focused and CGI battle scene orientated, that it just wasn't much for than a battle movie, and being held in the multiverse, it wasn't anchored to anything real or interesting. A solid swing and a miss for this otherwise fun story line."
"May 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was colorful but the story wasn't .
"May 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The worst MCU movie by far.  No real investment woth Kang, CGI awful."
"May 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,Somehow it wasn't enough.
"May 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel movies became boring recently, nothing interesting or creative."
"May 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,At least the popcorn was good!
"May 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Oooooof. This is one big boring cgi fest that just drags on forever. Kang sucks too
"May 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,I know it s super hero movie but when they explain in previous versions that you need a helmet and you own oxygen in the first movies and then you see all of them wo them you know marvel has lost the will to make quality content
"May 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant Man And The Wasp Quantamania is not the best marvel movie.  It is really chaotic at times and the story line is A MESS. The characters are ok but MODOK just looks terrible.  MODOK is marvels worst villain yet! But the main villain Kang is the person that holds this movie together! He is the perfect villain! Overall Ant Man And The Wasps [maybe] Final movie in the trilogy is a good movie for real marvel and Ant Man fans but for a meh marvel fan, maybe skip this one."
"May 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie would have done better as a 6 or 8 part series. If it was done this way, especially for Jannet and Kangs' relationship backstory it would have made for better character development. The plot was rife with holes, everything felt rushed, the humour was dry and not funny and this movie was riddled with sub-par acting (especially Jentorra - not well cast and honestly all this actresses scenes where cringy). Visually, the CGI wasn't the best for a Marvel movie, although they did a good job with Kang and and interesting take on M.O.D.O.K. Loki fans wait for the after credits scenes for a treat."
"May 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Serious disconnect between critics and users. Critics are clueless.
"May 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Shallow movie, bad story....Disney needs to change the way marvel movies are approached...I think it is not hard to delivery what the public wants....all the bests stories are already written, just ask the producers to read the comic books......"
"May 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ending was not satisfying 
"May 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not understand what the need was to make this film or how the actors could endure the lines and story they were handed. I would give this zero stars if I could‚Ä¶*sigh*
"May 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"An alright superhero movie let down by a formulaic plot with nothing outstanding about it.  Visually it's very good with lots of inventively different characters and a weird setting full of psychedelic landscapes, but the characters themselves conform to stereotypes and the main characters have little development.  The story is relatively shallow and formulaic, consisting of a different world, a revolution to inspire and an unstoppable villain only the heroes can defeat.  There's a good amount of humour and the action scenes are entertaining, even if you have seen it all before, but ultimately, nothing really stands out about it, either great or bad."
"May 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"while a little disjointed and a slightly rushed start, this movie was so easy to get into. You can always count on Ant-Man movies to bring a light heartedness mixed with the heavy nature of the story. Can't wait to see more!"
"May 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,Disney keeps setting up kids to take over dangerous situations formerly solved by the adults in their movies.
"May 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't let the bad reviews scare you away.  This movie packs a punch and leaves you ready for the next phase
"May 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,Its not a great marvel movie but atlest not a disaster.
"May 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"They made Ant-Man an Hank punks in this movie. The actress that played cassie did a horrible job trying to act like a young teen. Hopefully they show use that Scott Lang is a variant created by (he who remains) to help reset the time lineüòâ
(Disney) if you mess up blade you do know it's over an marvel will partner with Sony an give you the Young avengers in a different time line"
"May 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Some brilliant production design and visual set pieces combined with an excellent cast are wasted on a simple and predictable story arc and a low-wattage performance from the main villain. ""Kang will Return""? Not so fast."
"May 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The CGI looks bad, and what could have been an awesome story, turned silly. ""Advanced smart ants building a society"" just sounds silly! Overall, 2/5 for humor and some likeable characters."
"May 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie. Definitely entertaining to watch!
"May 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Que hueso de pel√≠cula, la verdad es un pelicula demasiado generica"
"May 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Rubbish. Generic story badly written
"May 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie as a whole was awesome. Ive heard people complain and I honestly dont align with most of those complaints. I understand people at this point are getting marvel fatigue. But theres an easy fix to that, dont see marvel movies."
"May 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,I thought it was pretty good when I saw it in theaters. Kang was great and it was a fun ride. Don't understand the hate it got.
"May 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie Kang magnificent doesn't get to be the best comic book will it be that in Kang Dynasty we will have world domination by kang!?
"May 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,Big disappointment! Hollywood just can't make good movie anymore.
"May 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it! A first true opening (after What If‚Ä¶) to the happenings of Universes outside the MCU; adds a whole new plot to the MCU. Reveals everything about the quantum realm. Electrifying! It would be great to have these good heroes to return again!
"May 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was just a horrible experience. My wife and I sat thru the entire film but wanted to leave very early when it became clear that the writer and director didn't know what the movie was. Either that or maybe Disney or Marvel or the producers interfered, which ALWAYS ruins a film. If they could make a better film they'd be directors not producers. 

(Take for example the last Dr. Strange film which should have been amazing directed by Sam Raimi but it was horrible, likely for this very reason.) 

Either way, this movie was awkward, unnatural, horribly written, and it just felt LAZY. Michael Douglas attempted to elevate his part with his excellent acting, but there was no way to save the train wreck of a film. We hated this experience. Worth the exception of James Gunn, Marvel really suffers now from weak storytelling and lackluster directing. Don't watch this."
"May 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty cool movie. I'd definitely recommend watching it.
"May 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,I don't get why everybody hated it so much.
"May 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Magic! Visually stunning with a memorable performance of the character Kang.
"May 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was good, though not particularly. It's plot was a little strange, but it had a comedic feeling. It had to many special effects. All in all, it was above average, but still not amazing."
"May 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a huge ant man fan, this was a disappointment. It felt like marvel was trying to turn ant man into a hero more like Dr. Strange. It was just too flamboyant in away that didn't work with his character as a whole. Also, the humor sort of sucked."
"May 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is a good start to a new era for marvel, but it felt a little off. The plot was good but the excecution? Meh, it could be better."
"May 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"the least of the 3. Kang was really good. but the CGI really could have been better, including MODOK. but overall fun."
"May 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too rushed, it couldn't focus on one thing for too long felt like a child was telling a dream they made up, Kang was the only good part of this and modok was funny but also stupid in the sense that he really wasn't needed. I couldn't take this movie seriously, wish I could. I don't hate it but it's not great 3.5/5"
"May 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a wild ride! Very fun, funny. Very enjoyable. I can't believe anyone had something negative to say about it. Don't believe the bad reviews. This is a very good movie and deserves credit for it."
"May 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,O que foi feito nesse filme chega a ser um desrespeito com o que dever√≠amos considerar introdu√ß√£o da nova fase da Marvel
"May 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The best part of this movie is that you don't need to see it to understand any other Marvel movies because it contains no character development and it's plot takes place in a literal pocket dimension. A bottle episode of a film. William Jackson Harper is charming as always, wish we could have seen more of his character because his minor role was the only memorable part of this film."
"May 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Majors saves the day. Awful script and use of The Volume. This was the mistep that nobody wants, but necessary to get things right."
"May 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Despite how important the storyline is in the grand scope of the MCU, this movie somehow felt like it had no stakes. An overuse of cringey humor often ruined what could have been meaningful moments. Unfortunately, this is just the latest in a recent  string of subpar Marvel movies."
"May 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Muchos agujeros de gu√≠o, muchas casualidades que ayudan a que la trama no se estanque, pero sobre todo los peores di√°logos de todos los que a tenido una pel√≠cula de Marvel"
"May 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente pel√≠cula, muy buenos gr√°ficos"
"May 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,The MCU is going down hill like an olympic skier
"May 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,Silly villain in a weak movie
"May 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just so dull. Nothing new and lacks all humour the previous films had.
"May 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie starts off with so much potential‚Ä¶and I had high hopes for it. However, this thing collapses under its own weight and fails to deliver as it promises in the trailers. Kang is a pretty compelling villain but, overall, the movie leaves tons to be desired and it ends in a pretty comically ridiculous way. Overall, this film will leave you feeling like you wasted a ton of time. Though it's not as bad as Doctor Strange 2, it feels hollow and does nothing to push the marvel universe forward."
"May 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie is not that bad. But its missing some of my favorite characters. Kang is good. Ant man is funny but the others were kind of boring. Just being honest but you still need to see this movie.
"May 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a fine movie, only the ending was a little bit messed up. They introduced Kang well, but he died too easily. He also didn't show his true powers. Meh."
"May 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The plot seems like it was written by a room full of hyperactive 12 year olds high on candy. Nothing made the least bit of sense. Even the CGI looked like a bad LSD trip. I left after the first half hour. Even Bill Murray couldn't do anything with this script, it was that bad."
"May 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was the worst of the bunch. Paul Rudd was a joke and sidekick in his own movie, the push to scoialism message was crazy and not one I was interested in being preached at about, I hated what they did with MODOK.  I hate what they did with his daughter and his relationship. Too much activisim, too much of ""the message"" and making sure all the women were the real heroes of the movie when that is not how it should have been.

Waste of time, glad I didn't waste money to see it."
"May 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Good film I'm like look the movie
"May 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was so hyped for this movie, especially waiting to see street-level superhero Ant-Man fight against the multiversal terrorist Kang. But almost everything in this movie multi-universally disappointed me. Every character in this movie was either dumb or useless. While Kang was definitely terrifying, he felt so wasted and I completely lost it when he didn't just kill Ant-Man with his sonic blast. The movie made him as dumb as dumb can be. And instead of trapping the heroes in the Quantum Real (which would've been amazing and interesting), they go back to Earth and literally nothing has changed at all. Though, it did have some fun moments such as the clone scene. But even those were overshadowed by the bad parts.

As the start of Phase 5, I was so depressed after this movie and I hope Marvel does better because its about damn time."
"May 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.. Horrific script, chaotic plot, and whoever picked the cast, go find another job please."
"May 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,so pathetic ..KANG lose to a ant... worst movie i have seen for a very very very very very long time.. stop make this shit
"May 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang is amazing! this Movie has many diferent things about the Multiverse and it's important for the rest of the movies in the MCU.
"May 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was definitely the worst marvel movie of all time. Even Thor love & thunder cannot top this. It was my first marvel movie that I was checking my watch during the movie to check how much time was left to the end... I was really excited to see Paul Rudd as Scott again but he didn't have much to do here since everything was so awful. The script, the characters and the CGI. Very disappointing."
"May 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Stan Lee must be turning in his grave at this tripe. Glad it only cost 71p to watch! Shockingly bad, so disappointed, had high hopes for this...... üò•"
"May 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"filme mal feito, sem cenas memor√°veis, roteiro mediocre."
"May 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Que filme lixo mds, o kang em si √© muito bom mais o restante √© uma lixo, o filme √© chato, cgi n√£o √© bom,  s√©rio n√£o vale a pena"
"May 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,My Bezt villain Kang is Coming.......!! üêú Ant-Mans Courage - Ants hard works Are Inspired me ‚ú®
"May 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie starting for the beginning of Phase 5 which introduced the most dangerous threat we were waiting for, after Thanos. The journey to the Quantum Realm, and the CGIs were good. Very funny as well as serious, we know that AntMan is as usual like this. Nothing was bad, no satisfactions I got from this movie. I agree that this is a perfect movie."
"May 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wow this was boring full with terrible special effects and that just a few thing's wrong with this piece of rubbish.
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It really was horrible, I loved kang but everything else was crap‚Ä¶ üëé"
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This has the creativity and magic from the GOTG 1 & 2, and the Thor films.  Comic retcons aside, the characters and dialogue were well done and witty.  I find the 'critics consensus' oddly far off the mark here.   Its a very re-watchable film for me."
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring and predictable, I did not like the movie"
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I could not stop asking myself how they would breath if they are smaller than an oxygem atom.. But very well, good history and maybe a signal that the MCU is trying."
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The best of the Ant-Man trilogy and very underrated.
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Temos aqui uma hist√≥ria simples, num mundo espetacular em CGI, um vil√£o muito bom, mas que leva os protagonista de lugar nenhum para nenhum lugar. N√£o h√° evolu√ß√£o, n√£o h√° perigo real e as tramas paralelas n√£o agregam em nada, a Holpe e Hank pouco aparecem e se n√£o tivessem no filme n√£o fariam falta. Filme que prometeu muito e entregou pouco. OBS: o MORDOC √© um personagem horr√≠vel em todos os sentidos."
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"a good film, a reasonable script, good action scenes and a great performance by jonanthan majors, but they could have used this variant of kang better."
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie so much. Getting to see parents and kids questing together to save the multiverse and time itself after having lost so much time together from past world-saving adventures was my favorite part. Kang is a mysterious and terrifying villain that in many ways makes Thanos look like an average bully. I even liked how they handled MODOK, which is just a ridiculous character in the first place. This made him fit firmly into the MCU in the best way I can imagine."
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"For the third consecutive time I have been suckered into watching this story unfold all the while wondering why I would continue to punish myself.  There is genuinely only one redeeming factor in this movie and its not Paul Rudd, who seems to try a little less each time to carry this franchise.  Fool me once, shame on you..."
"May 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"come√ßo foi incr√≠vel, por√©m chegando no ato final o filme fica gen√©rico"
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite what the ""critics"" say, this movie delivered!  Paul Rudd and crew provided an excellent performance, but there was room for improvement with the writing."
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Shock, marvel have another hero movie thats a miss, pros and cons list as follows;
Pros - paul rudd
        - paul rudds (theres lots of him)
Cons - EVERYTHINGGGG, like everything, seriously its a really bad movie. It makes captian marvel look less bad, and thats a baddddd movie.
Once more i am let down by marvel and their poor effort and shocked in their belief that this movie would be gold ...tut tut tut"
"May 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I love the MCU, I love Ant-Man and I love Paul Rudd. Paul Rudd carries the movie hard but was a bit of a let down considering it launched Phase 5 and was the cinematic debut of Kang. Best thing of the movie was Paul Rudd. Worst thing was the cinematography and some of the CGI."
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is the most painfully average movie I've ever seen. It is a by-the-numbers blockbuster, that feels as if it's only purpose is to set up future, far more exciting marvel projects. The only thing that really elevates this movie is the scenes between Janet Van Dyne and Kang, due to Pfeiffer and Majors' acting and chemistry. The movie is poorly written, setting up that family is an important theme, before kind of ignoring this theme so that they can race towards a generic, forgettable, CGI heavy finale action sequence. When Scott and cassie's relationship is explored, it seems hollow and surface-level, and we don't spend enough time with the Van Dynes. Unfortunately, the direction here is bland and unimaginative, and the shrinking and enlarging powers that have been used so effectively in the other films, and the main appeal of those films, are used very poorly here. Overall, this movie is watchable, because of course it is, it's Marvel. However, it just comes across as very generic. The best word to describe this movie is passable. It's fine. It's not bad, but it's just not particularly good either."
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was a good film all around, worth a watch if you are a fan of sci-fi/superhero films"
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There were parts that were really good and fun to watch. Some other parts was really a meh, something was wrong with those particular scenes. The jokes were at least funny"
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Despite a few good laughs, this acid trip of a movie really made it seem like the creators of this movie gave up. I found myself thinking ""and just when I thought it couldn't get any dumber"" in pretty much every scene."
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"La tercera entrega de Ant-Man lleva al protagonista y compa√±√≠a en un alocado viaje por El Reino Cu√°ntico repleto de escenas alucinantes de ensue√±o. Como siempre pasa en Marvel, la gran cantidad de efectos digitales hace que la pel√≠cula sea una traves√≠a visualmente alucinante con escenarios, criaturas y personajes que hacen recordar al mundo de Star Wars o a las alocadas desventuras de Futurama. El grupo compuesto por Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer y Kathryn Newton son un gran estrellato para la pel√≠cula. La introducci√≥n de Kang despu√©s de la serie Loki ya es un avistamiento de lo que est√° por venir en esta fase 5 del MCU, lo cual es un muy buen inicio para comenzar esta siguiente fase. Modok es un personaje bastante bizarro y caricaturesco, pero tiene un cierto aire del Modok original. Un detalle que se puede notar es que a diferencia de las pel√≠culas anteriores de Ant-Man, aqu√≠ hay un poco menos de humor y m√°s seriedad. Aun as√≠, el humor de Scott Lang se sigue manteniendo. Esta pel√≠cula es un muy buen inicio para comenzar la fase 5 y una experiencia visual alucinante que entretiene sin parar. Mi calificaci√≥n final para esta pel√≠cula es un 9/10."
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this one. There was some amazing action and graphics were great! Some ggood funny parts too
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,De principio a fin una decepci√≥n. Con tantas historias originales del universo marvel para contar nos vinieron a entregar este intento de pel√≠cula
"May 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Un giro interesante hacia el rol de Ant-Man y la aparici√≥n de un nuevo villano del UCM que esperemos no demoren mucho como Thanos en darle seguimiento a su historia, llena de malos chistes y siguen agregando personaje a su catalogo de Marvel. Deja muchos huecos en la trama presentados en sus pel√≠culas pasadas es buena para pasar el rato y conocer el futuro del UCM nada m√°s ü•±"
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was horrible. Quantomania is an embarrassment to Ant Man movies. I absolutely loved the first two Ant Man movies just to show that I am not biased. Marvel has been going down a dark road lately with the fail of doctor strange multiverse of madness, Thor love and thunder and pretty much all marvel movies since endgame have been awful. It is sad to say that Marvel will never be good again."
"May 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The latest installment in the Ant-Man franchise is a mixed bag, delivering some fun moments and clever action scenes but ultimately falling short of its potential. While the film's central character, Scott Lang (played by Paul Rudd), remains a likable and engaging hero, the plot feels overly convoluted and messy.

One of the biggest issues with the movie is that it tries to cram in too many characters and subplots, resulting in a cluttered and sometimes confusing story. The addition of the ""Kang"" character, played by Jonathon Majors, feels like an afterthought, with her motivations and backstory feeling underdeveloped and unsatisfying despite the excellent acting from Majors.

That said, the movie still manages to deliver some enjoyable moments, particularly when it leans into its comedic elements despite trying to be too funny at some points. Rudd's natural charm and wit shine through in many scenes, and the chemistry between him and co-star Evangeline Lilly remains a highlight of the film.

Ultimately, though, the new Ant-Man movie feels like a step backwards for the franchise and Marvel. While it may please die-hard fans of the character and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, casual viewers may find it to be a forgettable and muddled experience."

De las peores cosas que a hecho Marvel"
"May 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's just so damn mediocre. It's the most meh MCU film. There are a lot of positives here to be fair but there are just too many negativities to ignore the fact that this film wasn't great. I'm a huge MCU person and it hurts when I wait nearly three years for a movie to be released and then walking out with this attitude about it. Kang was under-utilised, MODOK was painfully absurd and awful, the VFX was iffy as hell! But performances overall were good, the characters had their moments and I'd say a 2/3 of the jokes landed which is enough for me. If you're an MCU fan, 100% watch this. If you're not, maybe steer clear and spend your money on a better film."
"May 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Literally the best ant man movie. Don't believe the critics.
"May 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The MCU is tired and dated. They are so desperate to have EVERYTHING link together that the stories have just started to become ""How many people can we sell Disney + to and hey! Don't forget the after credits so you know that we are still going to be making movies that involve you having to watch more Disney+ specials because if you don't you won't have any idea whats going on- okay have fun bye!""
It is. Tiring. As someone with Disney+ and as someone whos friends do not have it- seeing modern Marvel movies has become a process of me explaining every little thing to friends who don't have Disney +. Its become a confusing drabble to anyone not ""up to date"" with every little thing. And this, is just a mess of a movie that is desperately trying to cling to the coattails of the first movie- ALSO? WHY WAS MODOK IN THIS?? WHY?? IT MADE NO SENSE??? IT WAS STUPID??? WHY??"
"May 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Messy story with side characters that felt utterly pointless. Even the best part of the movie, Kang the Conqueror, felt underwhelming near the end, which is disappointing considering his role in the MCU in the future"
"May 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is too predictable & overly hyped for a big fan disappointment. Heroes win in the end, CGI wasn't that great, the villain was astonishingly amazing. The villain is what saved this movie and made it 10x better, but the writer decided for him to defeated at the end which ruined the momentum for the upcoming crossover Avengers film. Hopefully the changes in Marvel Studios from Phase 5-7 will help redeem his momentum following up to the next two Avengers Film."
"May 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors was great. He is the reason to see this!
"May 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Really cringe feel asleep in the movie horrible visuals honestly felt like a rip off of Star Wars and also the movie felt so long and also there was no action scenes
"May 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Only joke that landed was comparing socialist to mindless insects devoid of individuality and free will!
"May 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie was not as bad the critics are making it out definitely watch!
"May 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was really great. The CGI wasn't fantastic, but I think Kang was what did it for me. Kang was pretty threatening, and I think Jonathan Majors did a fantastic job portraying the villain who's going to alter the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. We haven't seen the last of Kang, that's for sure...."
"May 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Solid Marvel flick.  As usual, Paul Rudd delivers a spot on performance."
"May 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another lazy and lousy marvel film with dull action and dull visuals, everything is so confusing and convenient"
"May 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A very simple movie to introduce Kang The Conqueror. The effects are not spectacular or bad, they are ok. Forgettable music and photography except in a single very good scene.. Michelle Pfeiffer's character is obnoxious and boring. The wasp does nothing in almost the entire movie. The development of AntMan is very little. The best of the film is the performance of Jonathan Mayors as Kang but his ending is disappointing."
"May 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the best movie for a loong time. It felt like the old Marvel somehow.
I loved everything about it i wouldn't mind if it was a 4hours long I'm totally watching it againüòÇ
The whole Modok thing was so funny, he's literally egg from Puss in bootsüòÇ 
I loved Cassie, i was really sceptical the whole time but i loved Cassie so much.
I loved the visual and everything.

"May 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Minha opini√£o: Este ano 2023 at√© o m√™s de abril, os super-Herois n√£o acertaram a m√£o. Creio que os telespectadores est√£o meio cansados com o estilo meio canastr√£o das estoria. Creio que estejam esperando algo mais realista? Batman, Justiceiro, Coringa,.... Pois Dr. Estranho, Wakanda, Shazam,... N√£o agradaram ao publico, tiveram bilheteria razo√°vel, por√©m poderia ser 5X mais, como outros filmes j√° demonstraram. Aqui para mim, mais um fracasso, n√£o chega a ser como Shazam, pois para perder, tem que ser muito ruim. Oque muitas vezes vejo que em alguns filmes para ir ao reino Quantico tem que passar um filme inteiro construindo uma m√°quina. E todo desafio para ir at√© l√°. E chega um filme que uma adolecente faz, miniatura e leva todos ao reino qu√¢ntico. Chegando l√° existe um mundo que se pegarmos os Guardi√µes da Galaxia ou Thor os reinos s√£o iguais. Ent√£o o Universo e o reino Quantico s√£o iguais? Com seres diferentes, guerra ente eles, bla, bla, bla,.... E para completar o reino Quantico se mistura com o Multiverso,....... E se prolongar este assunto tem muito pano para manga. De volta ao reino Quantico Pfeiffer que pelo jeitonunca contou como foi sua vida l√°, e que teve at√© seus namoricos. Kkkkkk Mesmo estando de volta 5 anos. E agora que esta de volta ao reino se descobre tudo que ela encobriu. E que ela tinha relacionamento com Kang e que ele mentiu para ela seu verdeiro eu. E agora ele quer sair do reino qunatico para dominar o Universo. Ent√£o toda a fam√≠lia formiga luta para voltar, impedir que Kang fuja e libertar o povo do reino qu√¢ntico das m√£os tir√¢nicas de Kang. Uma interpreta√ß√£o mediana aos atores, que trouxe um ar de saudosismo foi Bill Murren em uma apari√ß√£o r√°pida. Douglas tem uma visibilidade pequena no filme, mas ele tras o exercito da salva√ß√£o que s√£o quem? As formigas claro. E o temper√¥ como diz Jaquim √© a velha estoria da briga de pai e filha, que depois o pai faz de tudo para salvar a filha rebelde, onde no final os 2 se arrependem e se abra√ßam. Ahhhh estava esquecendo de MODOK, mudaram toda a sua estoria dos quadrinhos aqui, e para mim foi uma grande piada do filme. Um vil√£o do mal como MODOK ser colocado nas telonas como foi, e como fazer de Hitler um papai Noel.
Roteiro e enredo teria de ser uma outra estoria, enredo,.... erraram.
Vale apena assistir? S√≥ se voc√™ gasta de Super Herois e v√™ todos os filmes.
Nota: 5"
"May 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No NO NO!
Antman was fun and kept a lot of stuff by the comic book... all I can say is this is the death knell for the MCU! As a lifetime fan who grew up on the comics, watched EVERY MCU movie to come out from Iron Man and beyond... I have lost all hope for the Marvel Universe and this movie drove a stake through that! Save your money, and save your time, it's not worth investing in the new MCU sh**show!"
"May 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don't understand why it was panned so much.

OK, it's not the greatest out there, but it's fun, entertaining, with great effects."
"May 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Antman can't do anything right. This is what we get in phase whatever from Disney. One of the nicest, cutest characters in the MCU was Cassie. Now grown up and a snarky known it all that no one should like. Way to go Disney. It was better than Love and Thunder but that's a very low bar. So there ya go."
"May 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang held the movie.
"May 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"√â um bom filme, mas sem muitos risco e sempre a mesma forma da Marvel de sempre."
"May 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie and plot was amazing the cast was awesome. The only problem I had was killing off modok in his first movie
"May 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wasted my time again.
"May 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Another forgettable entry from phase 4 MCU. I think I'm done with the MCU.
"May 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"That was bad. Like really bad. 

First, it's just a visual mess. It is best described that someone threw all 9 Star Wars movies into an AI system that spat out these generic over-saturated alien-like beings and their clothes, rides, and buildings. It absolutely made it so much worse that the pace was throwing one random ridiculous CGI situation after another while Michelle Pfeifer kept telling the others to be quiet and to trust her and that she'll explain later. That got tiring really fast as it continued all the way to the end of the first half. 

Second, the story and character development were just childish. I don't understand why they are re-engineering the Marvel movies into what can only be described as tween movies. The whole thing felt very much like Spy Kids movie, but with cringe. They stole elements from Rick and Morty but couldn't even make that fit well. The cliches were endless, and the whole story villain, and even the cameo of Bill Murray, could not be more unoriginal.

Third, writers and director seem to be trying too hard to promote female empowerment and establish Cassandra Lang in particular, as a strong independent highly talented and capable woman. As usual when done badly it ends up back-firing. Half the movie is spent making both Scott Lang and Hank Pym look like idiots following whatever pops up. The movie's title starts with ""Ant-man..."" and somehow the two ant-men (Hank was the original Ant-man before Scott) were made ineffective sidekicks stumbling through the plot. Cassie somehow exudes extraordinary talents completely unexplained when or how could a teenage girl have developed them. For one (and I am quoting the forced glory line used in the movie here) she: ""built a subatomic hubble telescope in a basement"", can punch and beat soldiers right and left, managed on a coin toss to inspire a revolution simply for being at the microphone, and turned a chronic hardened villain towards good by telling him ""don't be a dick"". It all feels unearned, and I wish they understand that cool characters do not need other characters in the movie to look at them and say out loud ""so cool"" when they do something. This is the epitome of uncool. 

I really tried to enjoy this movie, but I just couldn't. If you thought Spy Kids was bearable, this is significantly worse, because at least Spy Kids did not have so much cringe and actually landed a lot of funny jokes."
"May 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me gust√≥ mucho, graciosa y los personajes muy bien dise√±ados. Muy recomendada."
"May 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,doom of Marvel Studios
"May 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang the conqueror is wasted big time
"May 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not my type
It was ok"
"Apr 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Its good for what it sets out to achieve, being another fun marvel movie with a simplistic story and quippy humour. It does introduce an interesting villain for the marvel cinematic universe and creates anticipation for further appearances. Don't expect any deeper messages or themes and you will enjoy it."
"Apr 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"When you think things can't get any more mid, they release this. 

It's awesome how they can ruin something add simple as super hero movies with bad politic takes."
"Apr 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,ant man and the wasp quantumania is nothing like the previous 2 it didnt have the fun the previous two had but i enjoyed jonothan majors kang who probably caried the movie but the movie was boring and wasnt enjoyable i almost fell asleep pls dont  waste your money on this movie.
"Apr 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is a decent start to phase five, and though the plot is a bit messy and the humor was hit or miss, i appreciated the high stakes and emotional scenes."
"Apr 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Such a terrible start to the phase 4, and featuring a ""mighty"" villain defeated by ants..."
"Apr 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked it, but I think it could have been better."
"Apr 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just uninteresting and a huge CGI overload
"Apr 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie is very fun, I like it but the end credits are very good and mysterious."
"Apr 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,afther thanos every marvel movie will be just ok or less.
"Apr 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It wasnt really that good, tho its fine, its lacking of something but I dunno what it is. I think its just fine for me, its like meh its okay"
"Apr 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not as good as the other 2 , but entertaining!"
"Apr 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,I liked the concept. The world was cool. Creatures were cool. Story was weak. Plot was bad.
"Apr 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,A solid start to phase five with higher stakes that soar well over the occasional unevenness of the film. Kang is awesome here too.
"Apr 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"MEH... the fact that it is Paul Rudd makes it watchable. But the plot, the acting, and especially the directing truly is laughable."
"Apr 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The Antman movies are great and I'm glad that‚Ä®AntMan And The Wasp Quantumania ‚Ä®ended up carrying that torch which is why I rate it a 3/5 because the visual effects are amazing, the way they did MODOK was great. The movie was a bit slow in the beginning and middle but it was great. Some of the jokes are funny."
"Apr 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie attempts to use many different plot points all at once, and effectively accomplishes none of them. It uses a new, never before seen fantasy setting with plenty of potential, which is barely expanded upon and given next to no depth at all. It tries to introduce the protagonist's daughter in a new light (given that she is older now than she was in previous films) and create not only a character far too different from how we've seen her before, but essentially fail in every way at how to correctly build a character. In the movie, the quantum realm is something that is near impossible to access and is a concept which very few can even begin to understand. Yet, supposedly, Cassie Lang has effortlessly created a machine which can safely transport our protagonists to the realm with zero setbacks. Not to mention that in previous mentions from past films, the quantum realm is supposed to a sort of hellish landscape which can drive anyone to lose their sanity within its grasp. Yet, now, we only see this as an inconsistency. In short, this film has countless flaws of both small and large size that prevent it from being anything remotely close to what the audience expects from a Marvel movie (one that not only marks the beginning of a new phase, but also introduces the next biggest villain, even less so). Some of these flaws include: A villain who is supposedly capable of obliterating entire timelines with ease,  being defeated by literal ants with robot suits. Hope van Dyne, one of the main protagonists (who's name is also in the title of the movie) gets little to no screen time and accomplishes nearly nothing for the story. This same issue applies to Hank Pym, who, much like Hope (though to an even worse degree), is completely useless in every way alongside the fact that the movie's plot would progress the same had he not even been there. Another of the protagonists, Janet, is set up to have plenty of valuable information on everything related to the character's dire situation, though she only ever reveals said information when it is convenient for the plot. A villain in the story, Modok, has his entire character arc reduced to a character telling him not to be a bad person anymore (in a singular line of dialogue, better yet), and he follows suit. This movie was supposed to redeem the MCU as whole, and revive our faith in one of the largest film producers of all time. Yet it fails at absolutely everything it attempts to accomplish. Villain introduction and backstory. Character introduction. World building. Character arcs. Dialogue. Pacing. Consistency to previous films. This movie somehow manages to fail at every single one of them. This is nearly every aspect of lazy writing I can think of off the top of my head. For a studio with as much money and resources as Disney, this is a blatant and shameful embarrassment."
"Apr 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kind of a wash and repeat movie. Not something I'll probably watch again. Boring, bad humor, bad story telling."
"Apr 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No es aburrida, pero desperdician los nuevos personajes, esta bien que sea c√≥mica pero la est√°n alcanzando niveles absurdos, los efectos no est√°n bien logrados, muy olvidable."
"Apr 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel Phase Four was a horrible follow up to a cinematic experience second to none. Phase five has started off terribly too. I knew the film had major problems. The second Cassie Lang went from being an ordinary teenager with a good head on her shoulders to some kind of quantum mechanics super genius. It wasn't believable that she decided one day she was going to build a tunnel to the quantum realm so they can send, some text messages back-and-forth. I'm being facetious of course, it's more likely that they were sharing social media posts, but I don't seriousness what were they thinking? My kids didn't like it, we found the humor to be stale, the CGI was awful, and it really felt like we were watching expensive fanfiction . If this is what marvel is going to be producing moving forward, I don't expect there to be a phase 6 or 7. Just my personal opinion."
"Apr 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,All the hype created for some big multiversal event was gone in vain. In the end it felt like movie was just made to debut the new Cassie Lang.
"Apr 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"OMG I thought the Eternals was stupid but this is even dumber.
Writer must really hate the source to disrespect it so much
MCU is long gone since EndGame .
Maybe the GOTG vol 3 will be the swan song of what once was great"
"Apr 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"While losing steam at the start, it turned fun at the end. Worthy start of phase 5."
"Apr 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"La pel√≠cula en general se centra en el reina cu√°ntico,solo que el mal cgi le afecto mucho a mi parecer,pero es entretenida, si no tienes nada que hacer ni ver ser√≠a buena opci√≥n"
"Apr 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,The ostentatious Quantum Realm CGI didn't do much to satisfy. Most of the film was unremarkable and forgettable - but some intimate scenes were compelling.
"Apr 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Not sure what the ""Critics"" babbling about!"
"Apr 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Poor visual effects, filled with plot holes, annoying girlboss characters and what the eff is up with MODOK, that has to be one of the most laughable visual effects jobs I've ever seen‚Ä¶they could have done it so well but they eurgh!"
"Apr 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pffffffft lazy cgi, plot holes and some plot moments that make no sense. Just Nathan majors is soooo good tho he carried the entire movie. Ant man guy is decent. What the fuck was modok that's so weird."
"Apr 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dear lord, the WORST movie I've seen in a long time. This is a VERY bad movie full of teen angst, plot holes, and WOW, they really screwed over Jonathan Majors -- the actor who played Kang. 

Fantastic in Loki... very funny and very powerful. Turned him into an ordinary villain overcome by ANTS. ü§Æüòç

Introducing Scott's rebellious, teenage daughter was the worst thing ever. Wish I could get my two hours back."
"Apr 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is one of Marvels worse films.while the comedy was nice and all,when I watched on the Disney Cruise it felt short,like I was watching 30 minute film.Anyways we'll be waiting for the fourth movie"
"Apr 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania

The third Antman movie is a departure from the past ones. It is less funny and swamped but carried by its villain. Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror is menacing and terrific, he brings many layers to his character, and this is pivotal seeing as he's Marvel's next big bad. Paul Rudd and Michelle Pfeiffer also excel in their roles. The visuals are also well-done.

The biggest issue with this movie is the plot. The characters don't develop, it's just like a singular occurrence at the end, like a bad dream, and nothing is produced from it save the conglomeration of Kangs. The humour is also lacking, it's sparse and when it's infused it's always wrongly timed.

I hope phase 5 can move on smoothly from the spearhead of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania."
"Apr 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was fun‚Ä¶ nowhere near as fun as the other 2
"Apr 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente pel√≠cula, trae mucho de los comics que los ne√≥fitos no entender√°n."
"Apr 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of crypto communist add ins. Quite fun for a Loki episode.
"Apr 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horribly generic movie, no coherence in any way, stuff just happens and nothing means anything because seconds later xyz happens and changes that. edit: just finished watching, the movie is full of moments where a character could use a power, but has sudden dementia and forgets he can do that move or something??"
"Apr 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Man that is one of the worst MCU movies
"Apr 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's been a long time since I've seen such a badly made Marvel production.
It's a mess of CGI thrown into a story that makes no sense at all."
"Apr 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"You Critics once AGAIN got it wrong SMDH. This movie was PHENOMENAL..
üî•üé•üé•üé•üé¨!"
"Apr 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It did a great job in my opinion both following its own story and setting the other Marvel movies up for a huge story I definitely recommend watching it.
"Apr 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst marvel movie. The colours and sound is good but it could not save the movie. My son said it was okay but I like more realistic movies.
"Apr 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,At least they could give its villain a worthy purpose and some brain. Disappointed!
"Apr 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Its a marvel generic movie, nothing different, no epic villain... bored"
"Apr 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is a very amazingly bad movie, I have actually never seen this and it looks BAD not like a good bad just bad. Need more Races in the film. Reviewed by Snap: A.Cannalire"
"Apr 28, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun colorful adventure with humor mixed in. A nice break from the over serious marvel movies. Loved it!
"Apr 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dumb. Get better writers.
"Apr 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,its not very good sorry about
"Apr 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,predictable story. bad CGI.
"Apr 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It seems to me that they are already trying too hard to follow the Marvel formula. They are missing out on something that was already epic in itself, the bar was set very high. It's one of those times you say, it's better to retire when you're at the top."
"Apr 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Es una burla al cine de superh√©roes.

Tanto dinero para no hacer nada."
"Apr 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"now ive never done this before with a movie & never felt the urge to want to do this. After watching this movie i just couldn't believe what i was experiencing. The actors are HORRIBLE from the daughter, mom, grandpa, grandma. Antman himself was decent but some scenes he was played out aswell. daughter can act to save her life. I just expected better when i sat down & decided to throw this movie on & eat my sandwhich that i toook my (actual) time to make. i ate so fast that i never even glanced up to the watch the movie. i was bored. the review doesnt even desever good pronunciation, nothing. i' done & so should be this little series of antman they got going on. keep him with the big boys. directors ruined their chance."
"Apr 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Johnathan Majors carried the movie, and he wasn't in it majority of the time. If you enjoyed the phase 4 formulaic method of movies, you'll like this one. As for me, it's become tired and bland. Kang is the only real shake up that's worth watching."
"Apr 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Oof, ugly CGI and it feels like there is no chemistry from Scott and Cassie in here."
"Apr 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was too chaotic and I didn't like that it didn't set in the real world. Too much CGI makes it impossible to follow. I smiled a few times though; Paul Rudd.
"Apr 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Plot is not buttoned up. Very watchable but just ot as refreshing as the movies before.
"Apr 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jonathan Majors was the best part about this movie giving us a great marvel Villain since Thanos these three stars go out to him only
"Apr 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"IT was boring , but when they mentioned the word socialism i got up rightthere andleft,i don't want to know anything about that because i lived it and i don't like that they use movies to send their messages to our youth,down whit socialism."
"Apr 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good Popcorn Movie 
and its important to understand the upcoming Marvel event.."
"Apr 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Um filme terr√≠vel! N√£o me lembro de ter visto um pior.
"Apr 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In Italian for Italian: Il film √® un guazzabuglio di quanto peggiore la Marvel ha da offrire. Trama poco studiata, personaggi insopportabili, universo copiato da altre saghe di fantascienza il tutto condito da nuovi personaggi trascurabili e tediosi. Anche sul piano della logica e della trama lascia molto a desiderare. Nota positiva: Scott Lang √® il solito grande personaggio, umano e dunque profondamente eroico."
"Apr 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was really good, funny..compelling characters, etc.

There a few issues with the plot, but it's easy to see past them."
"Apr 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible CGI fest that is only moderately saved by Jonathan Majors' performance and Paul Rudd.
"Apr 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Hey... the movie wasn't that bad. Paul Rudd is charming as always, Jonathan Majors is great as Kang and a good choice to follow Thanos, I thought M.O.D.O.K. was funny and intentionally looked weird. Although Hope was sidelined, there was no Luis, and the fact that Janet didn't tell the others what was going on is pretty stupid. Yes, the CGI was a bit dodgy, but in my opinion better than most of the movies in Phase 4 (excluding; No Way Home, Wakanda Forever & Shang-Chi), and by far the best movie of Phase 5 so far. 6/10"
"Apr 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really generally like Marvel and DC movies. I was never a real comic book geek but I loved cartoons based on the comics so superhero movies are right up my alley. I've enjoyed most of not all Marvel Movies that have come from a Marvel/Disney. This one, not so much. It's not that the movie is bad, I just found the plot messy and some of the content really confusing and a bit over the top. Spoilers below for some examples. 
I'm going to re-watch and see if I missed something or I can make more sense of everything. The acting was fine and the graphics and look were great too. Keep in mind, I actually liked Thor 3 so, saying that this isn't a good movie should tell you a lot. I'm glad I didn't see it at the cinema as I'd probably have been a bit upset. C for effort. It would have been much better to release this as a Disney+ movie in my most humble opinion. 






‚Äî‚Äî-





Spoiler:

There's a universe of quantum creatures, some of which look very human but aren't‚Ä¶they wear clothing and fly ships and have creature homes that can shoot cannons/beams or whatever. I just couldn't wrap my head around this. I should have as someone who can be entertained by superhero's and magic but, yeah, it was a bit much. 
I even tried to explain it away to myself as thinking, well, there's a whole universe out there so why not on a molecular level as well, but it still feels too much. It does however, solve why Kang could be trapped there. 

The probability storm I think pushed the movie just over the top for me. This is an area where anything caught in it splits and is copied by decisions based on whenever a thought process occurs (from what I understood) and so Scott is copied and multiplied hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions or billions of times?"
"Apr 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,After End Game there hasn't been one good Marvel movie. This was terrible save your money and you time.
"Apr 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Entretenida, cumple, pero muchos agujeros que quedan."
"Apr 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,g√≥wno nawet nie zamierzam oglƒÖdaƒá
"Apr 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel movies dont create the same exictment that it did in the past.
"Apr 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Really underrated. Like all ant man films
"Apr 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movies, Love Jonathan Majors acting 8/10"
"Apr 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very Entertaining. Last fight scene felt real, loved it."
"Apr 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's fun, it's funny, it's weird, and it feels like sci-fi and not super hero. I enjoyed most of the movie other than the premise of what gets them in trouble in the first place. Grandma is a bit of too much of a gurl boss, and the entire story wouldn't exist if she told her story, that's weak writing."
"Apr 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Only one mention of socialism as a joke. So that is a plus. Most non woke movie I have seen for a while.
"Apr 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Its this the new RIck and Morty? But boring?
"Apr 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Funy but not what i expected in the triology.
"Apr 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a complete and utter yawn-fest. It was Marvel-by-numbers. Characters were flat, story was dull, comedy was lukewarm."
"Apr 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Modok was terrible but the all movie was great. Kang was awesome.
"Apr 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Big budget mediocrity.
"Apr 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It had a few cool moments but the story is very incoherent, makes little sense and does not further anything. Good acting though. (Yes, Jonathan Majors also or even especially. Innocent until proven guilty. Remember?)"
"Apr 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The most confusing, complicated and unappealing movie in the entire Ant-Man series. Too much science- fiction and Majors is overrated."
"Apr 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Watching rich privileged people being super hero's is such a bore.
"Apr 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad writing, made the main villain look like an absolute joke, and the VFX was extremely rushed. One note characters for the most part."
"Apr 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Eu achei o filme visualmente muito bonito, o vil√£o realmente imp√µe medo e respeito mais infelizmente o final do filme jogou tudo isso fora p√¥s ficou fraco, se o homem formiga morresse no final mostraria de fato o terror imposto pelo vil√£o durante o filme."
"Apr 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The MCU continues with 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania'.

SYNOPSIS: 'Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne are dragged into the Quantum Realm, along with Hope's parents and Scott's daughter Cassie. Together they must find a way to escape, but what secrets is Hope's mother hiding? And who is the mysterious Kang?'

So two things have happened for me in regards to the MCU: 1) my enthusiasm for it is waining, and fast 2) like Star Wars the TV series' are now better than the films.

The thrill is gone. And that shouldn't be the case when they're attempting to build up Kang as the next 'big bad'. He's an incredibly powerful and evil villain in the comics but here he's beatable and makes silly errors of judgement.

And let's not talk about MODOK. A totally horrible interpretation of the character.

Although it's drenched in impressive CGI it's seriously lacking in a creative story. And you could argue there's too much CGI as none of the action ever feels real and grounded.

The fact Disney now have to deal with Jonathan Majors' very publicised domestic issues there's no clear route on where this story goes, beyond what they've already filmed.

Unfortunately though, I just don't care and it pains me to say this.

4/10"
"Apr 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,The Audience Score Is Good For My Opinion. The Whole Tiny Universe Looks Different. That Ass Was Good
"Apr 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very disappointed - lacks any originality or humour and playfulness of previous instalments.
"Apr 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a visually stunning piece, but it unsuccessfully introduces Kang, the new villain that everyone has been looking forward to. We encounter an ambiguous, irrelevant, and unmotivated villain. While the film cannot contribute to the universe's future, it also undermines the excitement for future projects. I lost all my curiosity about Kang with this movie. I hope we will be able to love Kang again, whom we will meet again in the second season of Loki, and we will obviously get to know him much better. For now, Kang couldn't even give half of Thanos' excitement."
"Apr 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Meh. Please delete this review
"Apr 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel fatigue is real. 
"Apr 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie. Jonathan Majors fits the role perfectly. Great performance!
"Apr 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Completely forgettable. The Marvel universe is in a downward spiral. üòû Well it was good while it lasted.
"Apr 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,The comedy did not hit as much as the other 2 films but it has the best villain.
"Apr 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Wasn‚Äôt the best marvel movie and the first and second were better but this was a pretty good movie and definitely worth a watching 
"Apr 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good addition to the mcu. Builds a nice story for how strong Kang is going to be. Funny scenes, good action. "
"Apr 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Hank Pym could've had a bigger role, same with Wasp. MODOK didn't need to be there, and Kang could have a better backstory"
"Apr 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Felt like walking out of the cinema
"Apr 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm in awe of how profoundly boring this movie was. There were moments I was drifting off to sleep. So if you manage to stay awake, you will also find that this movie was just stupid and weird. Why not make all the creatures alien instead of some of them looking like human but aren't really human??? And it was a failed attempt to combine a futuristic and primitive look. It all just came across cheap and lazy."
"Apr 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang was amazing. Stole the show!! The comedy was there in stone scenes but very forceful in other scenes. Very enjoyable compared to other Ant man movies.
"Apr 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Algo aburrida por momentos pero se puede decir que es entretenida, vamos marvel confio en ti"
"Apr 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Man I don't know I guess this is the directors fault right? So the one who replaced Cassie lang has no facial expressions at all. Literally same emotion and look every scene. Somebody needs to show her how to move her eyebrows. Most Kang scenes were good but the end credit scenes he looked fumb as duck. CGI looked awful. Not the best movie intro for kang.
"Apr 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It literally reminded me of Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Too much CGI. Way to ruin things Disney üëè
"Apr 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was‚Ä¶ extremely disappointing. It felt pointless, like a movie before the movie you actually want to watch. Totally forgettable. There were no real stakes, and so many characters were unnecessary. 

Michelle Pfeiffer was the highlight though - she had great scenes with Jonathan Majors, who was incredible as Kang."
"Apr 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved how the quantum realm was made to feel real. The family feel is awesome. Definitely recommend!
"Apr 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,It cannot get any worse !
"Apr 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"siento que las peliculas de Marvel ya llegaron a un punto de la decadencia, me encantan la primera y segunda de antman, pero esta vez se me hacia predecible todo lo que pasaria, luego el cambio de Abby Ryder Fortson por Kathryn Newton,  este cambio puede ser que no sea muy importante, pero para alguien que ha seguido cada pel√≠cula si se siente. El guion de esta se me hizo un poco est√∫pido y el uso excesivo de mal CGI o barato."
"Apr 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was lacking a complete story. It felt like the story was all over the place
"Apr 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely brilliant film. Live it from start to finish, amazing graphics good story line and plenty of fell good moments"
"Apr 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant man is my favorite in MCU, loved every movie about him. But really have questions about the cast in this one. Anyways, glad Marvel made something decent"
"Apr 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Cassie is a completely unbelievable character
"Apr 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Even for ""B-tier autopilot filler"" MCU content, this was bad. If I remember anything about it in 24 hours, it will be the words ""aggressively forgettable"". CGI glop visuals for most of its perfunctory 2 hour runtime. Script full of standard issue, ChatGPT-authored Marvel quips. (When your jokes are so bad that even Paul Rudd can't sell them, it's time to try yoga or quit drinking or... something. Make a change, any kind of change.)

And all this in service of another stapled on, design-by-committee Kang plot which continues where Loki left off (namely, in utterly failing to build tension for whatever multiverse Avengers battle they're cooking up 5 years down the road). Come on guys, a re-used endboss? This a new MCU low (even to me, and I watched Wakanda Forever). Although given their recent track record I'm sure they're no more than 90 days away from surpassing themselves. The post-Endgame death spiral continues apace. 

I always try to say at least one good thing about every movie I see. So, in the grand Marvel spirit of ""ending things in a really forced, tacked-on, unnatural way"", I'll close with ""At least The Wasp wasn't in this movie, I guess."""
"Apr 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Was very excited to see this movie , being it's the entry point for the new marvel big baddie (Kang). I say that to say very lack luster of a movie , predictable plot and premise. A decent watch at best . But Johnathon Majors Is must SEE!"
"Apr 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,weak movie. weak plot. great paul rudd
"Apr 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania could have been great. The movie doesn't get boring, and seeing the Quantum realm in all its colourful glory is awe-inspiring. It just suffers from a lack of risk. The plot was low-key and there were hardly any stakes in the film. Kang was underused for a film that was supposed to introduce him as Marvel's next big villain. Couple that with comedy that falls short of the previous Ant-man instalments and overly demanding CGI, and you get a forgettable superhero flick, which is unfortunate since it was a highly anticipated one."
"Apr 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It has the humor you'd expect with Paul Rudd, but the weakest of the Ant-Man films."
"Apr 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyable new age feel to a marvel movie. Closer to a star wars blaster fight. I enjoyed the story and thought it was another great addition to the series
"Apr 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"pretty good acting, but terrible story and terrible writing. The first two movies were funny but this new one sucks and is just cringey"
"Apr 22, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun movie with great actors. This feels more like a teaser for more to come but this is one of the few MCU products I would watch again post phase-3.
"Apr 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I find that people more in touch with reality tend to write more critical/negative reviews, and for good reason. I read the harsher reviews before attempting to watch this and found very quickly that I totally agree with them. I got about 25mins into it (which was a testament to my patience)... It could be great, if someone muted the sound, edited it to show only the quite amazing cgi backdrops/sfx and played some ambient music over it without all the hammy 'look at me' actor people. That, I'd watch."
"Apr 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible, horrible, horrible!!! Marvel clearly reached its point of no return. Sorry but not sorry, this film was dreadful. CGI wasn't that good, the plot killed this film and the characters weren't appealing at all. 

RIP Marvel movies. GoG: Vol 3 may be the only good Marvel film coming up."
"Apr 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The audience score baffles me with this film. The plot was bland and weak, the CGI was very poor in many scenes, with outright mistakes in the CGI at multiple points of the film. Too much MCU humour that undercuts some scenes that could have been somewhat emotional, though I will admit there were a few funny lines of dialogue here and there.

Kang was underwhelming, he doesn't have much to do here, and if you went into this film not knowing that Kang was going to be a big player going forward, he would just seem like another throwaway villain that the good guys beat in the end.

The Quantum Realm is really just a mess of completely unrelated backgrounds of CGI with bright colours. The art direction feels like an AI bot generated it with the words ""Colour, blobs, aliens"".

I don't know why ""Wasp"" is in the title, because her character is absolutely wasted. 

They recast Cassie for this film, and while I have seen Kathryn Newton be fairly good in other films/shows, she is really bad here. It may have been a lack of direction, but her line delivery is terrible, her physical acting is awkward and she just looks lost when on screen. A lot of her scenes feel like first takes, but they ended up in the film."
"Apr 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,For an ant man movie I felt it was pretty good
"Apr 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I love the MCU. With that being said, since End Game, only No Way Home has met expectations. Paul Rudd is always good, and I'm a huge fan of Johnathan Majors acting.. but... that's about it. This is one I'll only watch the one time."
"Apr 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I wasn't really paying attention to the movie I was watching my phone. This is movie okay. Well at least it's better than ant-man 2 but not ant-man 1. Kang the conqueror is the best part of the movie. M.O.D.O.K. looks weird in the movie but I like how weird he looks. Wasp is just there. Ant-man's daughter gets a lot of screen time in this movie and also they changed the actor from avengers endgame.
"Apr 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel continues to decline -  it really died with Avengers Endgame.
"Apr 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was cool over this super packed action movie.
"Apr 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'm very surprised people liked this movie.  I liked the other antman movies but this one was borderline bad.
"Apr 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I dont get the bad reviews. Its the best marvel movie since endgame.
"Apr 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Bad reviews were unjustified.  This movie is a lot of fun and excitement.  Don't listen to the haters!
"Apr 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Oof, Marvel is dead."
"Apr 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"the critics have failed us yet again. this film does have some exposition, but it's often presented as a joke that the franchise has already seen and done everything so nobody really cares to know the finer details. still, they provide enough for anyone who does want a little exposition. the movie is funny, and exciting in equal parts, and kang is one of the only characters that isn't outright comedic in most iterations. 

i think this is a perfectly good film, and the reason ant man was put in the spotlight is probably because the ending leads us into a new multiverse/set of timelines."
"Apr 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"QUANTUMANIA of mess, chaos, disconnected from anything that really matters."
"Apr 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Amazing!!! Sheer Billian.......Oh-yeah-it-SUCKED.
"Apr 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is nothing like the comic book series‚Ä¶ this company has gone off the rails. They want to keep a product that the customers do not want. It reflects at the box office. Like it did with Super Mario Movie,Top Gun and even Puss and Boots."
"Apr 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm usually not a big critic when it comes to Marvel movies because even when it's not so good it's still decent to mindlessly watch. But I don't know what it is with this one, but it's just a mess. Not a surprise tho when the same people looked at modok and thought ""yes this is a great version of this character!"".
Let's just hope this isn't the future of Marvel because this title is an all time low for them."
"Apr 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible in every way. Ugly aesthetic, script felt like it was written on the day by a teenage Marvel fan, cringey acting, awful CGI."
"Apr 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,√â um filme mediano. O roteiro √© fraco mas tamb√©m tem seus pontos positivos.
"Apr 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have no words. Sorry, love MCU, but why was this a film we needed to watch?"
"Apr 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is a fantastic addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe! The first two Ant-Man movies were already fun and entertaining, but this third installment takes things to a whole new level. The action sequences are thrilling and visually stunning, and the humor and heart that made the previous movies so great are still present in abundance. The cast is once again superb, with Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly reprising their roles as Ant-Man and The Wasp with ease, and newcomers Kathryn Newton and Jonathan Majors bringing even more energy and excitement to the mix. Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is a must-see for Marvel fans and anyone looking for a fun, action-packed ride at the movies."
"Apr 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"OMG this bad!
What have they done to the Marvel universe! Every time when I think I couldn't get worse."
"Apr 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I almost gave it a Oof, That was Rotten Rating of 1.5, but thought that would be harsh to give it a rating of 1.5 out of 5. So I ended up giving AM&W - Quantamania - 2 which is lowest of meh it passed the time. I can totally certify to that. AM&W - Q is the epitome of a movie that is ""Meh"". The Story was all over the place, World-building of Quantum realm could have been so much better but felt like a total rip off of a mediocre Rick & Morty episode and mostly AW&W - Quantamania and MCU in general really needs to double down on their overuse of CGI and CG fight. Soundtrack was also subpar compared to the first two movies.

Only highlights of the movie were Performances of Paul Rudd [very obvious] and Jonathon majors as Kang even though kang's power dimension and inconsistency of using his many powers was weird."
"Apr 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is not a good movie with even worse CGI. Seemed like everyone but Kathryn Newton phoned it in.
"Apr 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Vastly and unfairly underrated by the critics. This is a wonderful, funny entry into the MCU. For one thing, Janet Pym is not sacrificed and becomes an enduring hero of this saga. Great complex villain and hilarious ancillary characters. Plus there's Paul Rudd."
"Apr 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel that action that the journey doesn't just stop here but continues to Loki and the return of Kang, brutal if you ask me this studio am a dedicated fan of keeps sticking me to the screen whenever it's on this is truly marvelous, is been a while since i enjoyed and emersed myself in thought of excitement and not in any way comparing it to sex but actually sex comes first this is by the way but i really was in to the story of they keep linking and merging the stories in continuing order that doesn't really displace the root of his everything started and that fascinating if you marvel that this was in the right sense done right and i think i might start reading comics again but an still skeptical though."
"Apr 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Generic superhero movie where the protagonists are their own worst enemy. The movie attempts to hide its weak story with a bucket of CGI-goop and poorly written jokes.
"Apr 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was really good. Lots of action. Great story line.
"Apr 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It honestly didn't do as much as I hoped it would. Very ordinary, but not the worst watch. 50%"
"Apr 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,The third movie in the Ant-man series isn't all that exciting but starts an MCU journey onto the next phase. I think the comedic element added by Michael Pena in the first two movies is needed and would make this movie a bit more acceptable.
"Apr 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Action and CGI are great but acting needed a lot of work family bonding moments came off incredibly fake.
"Apr 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What the writer and director did to this movie should be a criminal offense. Cassie was beyond cringe, and not one joke landed. They took everything that made the Ant Man movies great and shot it right out the window. Really not impressed with these people Marvel keeps hiring that just simply don't care. However despite this Jonathan Majors crushed it as Kang, but needed more character development."
"Apr 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than the last Ant-Man movies a more serious tone to it this time
"Apr 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I personally enjoyed this movie, but I did feel like the plot was a little predictable. There is a lot of action and the acting is very good."
"Apr 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"3/5. It's a okay movie, storyline a little lazy. But Jonathan majors as kang chefs kiss! In total it's a acceptable marvel movie."
"Apr 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The entire movie was ""and then this happened"" seems like MCU is just for kids now‚Ä¶"
"Apr 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Film incroyable histoire compl√®tement folle qui se raccorde parfaitement avec tout l'univers Marvel pour moi Ant man 1 2 3 sont de loin dans mon top des meilleurs films/s√©ries Marvel !!!!
"Apr 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-man and the wasp 3 es de lo mejor, al momento de llegar al reino cu√°ntico es ah√≠ cuando sabemos lo que esta pasando en realidad en el entorno y con Janet, Jonathan Majors cada vez que asombra, demuestra de que esta hecho para ser kang el conquistador, hay 2 partes que se pierden y lo dejan pasar cuando se pon√≠a mejor la escena pero bueno. Y por ultimo las escenas post-creditos nos revelan lo que quiere kang como marvel a futuro en las pr√≥ximas producciones del UCM. Espero que marvel solo vea el buen camino que valla y que piense en sus fans para mejorar el futuro del UCM."
"Apr 18, 2023",POSITIVE,So pleased that Michelle Pfeiffer was far more involved in this one! Loved that everyone had something to do!
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I actually need to shut off my brain to enjoy this movie. It's not awful per se, but the storytelling could be much more thrilling if the production team were given more time to polish the CGI or even the storyboards. As it stands, this movie has the vibe of a rushed job. It's good, but not enough to scratch that itch."
"Apr 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really cool movie.  Felt different then other Marvel films which is refreshing.  Had a very sifi, psychedelic war feel to it that was really great.  I enjoyed this more then other recent MCU movies."
"Apr 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Screw the critics. This was a fun movie to watch.
"Apr 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors, and the CGI saved this movie tbh. I honestly think if they had , then it would be way better. Sometimes I sit alone at night and wonder if Jonathan Majors wasn't a domestic abuser maybe he would've been good in the Marvel movies. But whatever, maybe we can recast."
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Meh.. the fighting scenes are okay, and the effects are okay too. But there's too much going on for you to focus on anything. There's no loss, and the stakes are always very low. Too many characters interacting all the time makes half of them useless and without weight. 
A lukewarm start to a new saga. Kang was okay, though."
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible.............
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,20 minutes into to movie and i was already done. Why everyone acts like a ungrateful little smartass on the high horse? Why is Scott so apologetic for everything he does? Why they keep secrets all the time? Why is Cassie a super brain now? Disney knows how to write unlikeable characters and degrade the old ones. Nothing makes sense!
"Apr 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Full of actions and a little humor, just the right amount. When the superhero movies try to be too cute it gets annoying, unless it's Deadpool and then I'll make an exception because that's one of his superpowers. Jonathan Majors was amazing as the antagonist."
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I didn't have high expectations, but disappointment came nonetheless. I found Cassie extraordinarily irritating and wouldn't have minded if she wasn't in the film at all. For it to be a film about Ant-Man, as is the recent trend, the protagonist is overshadowed at the expense of the others. And the bad guy? He's nowhere near Thanos."
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The only reason I'll give it such a low score is only because of Michelle Pfeiffer..
Such an irritating face. Those filled up lips made me cringe in every scene she was in trying to show of her still trying to look ""young"". Get out of here"
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie, did not capture and hold onto what made the first antman so speacial.
the first one was about flaws and how to fix it and made the father daughter bond a promenet feature. and in this it seems that cassie is smarter then every body yet when she enters the quanum realm she doesnt know where she is? this idea that story comes second seems to ruin movies and studios seem to not care since the cash keeps rolling in they keep making bad movies."
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,DID NOT WATCH THIS ON DONT KNOW WHEN I WILL.BUT AINT KANG BLUE ?IS IT SO HARD TO PUT SOME BLUE COLOR ON A FACE .?
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst marvel films in my opinion. It was a total lackluster with no effort at all. Kang was really weak and the characters have become unlikable especially Cassie. I didn't laugh at any of the jokes because, it felt forced and cringy and the action sequences were just dull. I also think that the cgi was god awful and the plot didn't amount to anything."
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A boring, incomprehensible cartoon."
"Apr 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love marvel movies so that's one reason why I rated it 5 stars, but I also love ant man too he's just a fun character and such a good dad I love how much he cares about Cassie. I like how in this movie we got to see a little bit of what the mom did while she was in the Quantum Realm. I see how Cassie has just a bit of attitude towards her dad but it's shown that she cares a lot about her dad too. I love this movie and totally recommend it!"
"Apr 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don't know why people are hating on this movie so much. In my opinion, it's leaps and bounds better than that atrocious cringe-fest ‚ÄòThor: Love and Thunder.' This latest iteration of Ant-Man kept me entertained and gave me several laughs. The special effects were cutting edge, combined with some of a ‚ÄòStar Wars'-esque flair. Particularly the opening scenes within Quantumania, reminded me of that bar scene in Tatooine. It by far isn't the worst Marvel movie. I would even rank it slightly above the latest Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness. Yeah like most flicks these days, there's some plot holes, however my main gripe is that I wish they would've focused more on the mutant ANTS."
"Apr 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A movie that brings me hope for phase 5 of the MCU!
"Apr 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm a huge Marvel fan, and Ant-Man is one of my favourite Marvel movies, however Ant-Man and the Wasp was not quite as good. I think that people are too critical, and saying that this is the worst movie is ridiculous (Eternals takes that crown). And sure, it was nowhere near as good as the original, and it didn't live up to being the Cap: Civil war of phase 5, but think about it logically. It's Ant-man, a comedic character, against Kang. I think the big problem is really that nothing has changed by the end. There's no real character development or major changes in the MCU. But this movie made me laugh here and there, and Kang is an amazing character, So, all in all, it's fine‚Ä¶"
"Apr 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantummania had an interesting concept, but the movie failed to address some important questions regarding the quantum realm. The lack of explanation regarding the creatures living in the quantum realm left me unsatisfied, and the constant flow of information made the movie feel rushed without giving the audience a chance to breathe. Additionally, the way Khan was defeated with ants seemed a bit implausible and out of place. Overall, while Quantummania had some redeeming qualities, it fell short in certain areas, which ultimately made it a mediocre movie in my opinion."
"Apr 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme bem confuso, muitos efeitos e personagens um tanto pitorescos (lembram os de MIB), n√£o valeu meu dinheiro do ingresso."
"Apr 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Phase 5 of the MCU didn't start with a bang, but with a whimper. This film is literally everything we've come to unfortunately expect from this franchise. Overused and disappointing CGI, a predictable plot, a bloated cast, obnoxious side characters, questionable acting performances, extreme coincidences, and a complete lack of stakes come the end of the movie. If I had to give two positives about this film, I'd say that Michele Pfeiffer is great in her role, even if her character made a questionable choice. Jonathan Majors also brings a solid performance as Kang. Marvel/Disney are out of excuses at this point."
"Apr 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"So overall I think that this movie is great I love Cassie and that she kind-of finds a hero in her and I think that she can become a part of the New Avengers. Action, I think that the action is great although the final fight was good but there could have been a bit better like a more kick ass fight. Acting is perfect Paul Rudd, Kathryn Newton, Jonathan Majors and all the other actor and actresses have done a perfect job. CGI, ok so some people might say the CGI is bad but I watch a lot of franchises and those franchises were slowed down by COVID and till today still have poor CGI, and writing so in my opinion Ant-Man 3 has great CGI. Villain, I like Kang but I have heard somethings from the comics and I was impressed but after watching this movie I was not impressed by Kang he should have definitely been more powerful and something I took notice of is that he's like another character Tony Stark he gets his powers & abilities from his suit and is a tech-genius like Stark which explains why he's killing off all the Tony Stark's because he might have time traveled into the future and found out who ends up killing him which would be Tony Stark/Iron Man. Writing, I think that the writing for the movie is amazing compared to other franchises and resent movies. Story, I think that the story is great because it sets up Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars and tells us Kang's backstory. Casting, I think that the casting is perfect for Cassie but not sure for Kang. Characters, I liked the characters in this movie but I think that Luis should have been in the movie and hearing Scott's story and catching up on the 5 years from the snap in Infinity War. Adventure, I liked the adventure because we get to go down into the Quantum realm and explore it see the dangers of the place. Mystery, the great mystery is towards the ending in the end credits where we see all the Kang's unite."
"Apr 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent in her role, but the movie was to messy overall."
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a magnificent movie from beginning to end. Definitely a must watch
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,i really loved it.....one of best marvel movies
"Apr 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Only thing good about the movie was Kang. Wish they gave a little backstory for the characters. For being an Antman movie it felt like he was the 5th supporting character in the movie. It gave me Star Wars feels but in a bad way.
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,loved the story. great action. the colors and characters were awesome. didn't like all the cussing
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This is by far my favorite Ant-Man movie...
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was great, its not an endgame level movie, but it was a fun movie. it didnt really have an impact on the mcu, but not everything needs to be, scott is funny as always, but serious when his daughter is in trouble, and kang was f*ckin awesome. jonathan majors really nailed the part."
"Apr 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a nice movie, it's fascinating and thrilling. Don't know why people would rate this low"
"Apr 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I had high expectations for this one, and while the jokes were funny sometimes, and other times they weren‚Äôt. The action was good and the cgi could‚Äôve been better. But I have to admit I‚Äôm interested to see where they go with kang‚Äôs story as the new big bad of the MCU "
"Apr 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm a big fan of the Ant-Man movies. This one was good. Just not great. And couldn't they find a spot for the hilarious Michael Pena somewhere? Still, not a great start for Phase Five."
"Apr 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Much funny than recent marvel movies even I couldn't accept some scenes..
"Apr 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Scott is quite stupid
"Apr 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring. I did not care for michelle pfeffier or the antagonist. Paul rudd is magic tho
"Apr 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'll start by saying, I feel the critics are being too harsh on this film. It's not THAT bad and certainly doesn't deserve the title of worst Marvel film (Thor The Dark World). It's just different. They took a risk here by having Ant-Man as the first to take on Kang The Conqueror. I don't think it was the right choice, but I commend them for making Ant-Man look more powerful than he does in other films. Paul Rudd is Paul Rudd and offers some comic relief in what is otherwise a serious film, but the comedy is so random at times that it doesn't make sense. Apart from Loki Season 1, this is our first true look at Johnathan Majors as Kang and he plays him more menacingly than I could have anticipated and he is the perfect choice for the role. One complaint I have however, and it might be the point, but visually the Quantum Realm looks like a jumbled mess, and the film could've used more practical effects. Also, the first part of the film doesn't really match the tone of the rest, but it was nice to see Scott Lang truly living his best life after EndGame. I did love that this film gives Cassie Lang her time to shine, especially since she might be part of the Young Avengers. Even though they changed the actress, Kathryn Newton does a fantastic job. This is probably going to be the most divisive film in the MCU, which I see as a great thing because it causes more discussions. If you like the first two Ant-Man films, but wish they were more serious, this is the film for you."
"Apr 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"the plot took a while to get off the ground and at some points felt confusing. like why didn't janet tell everyone about her time in the quantum realm? i mean, it would've prepared them better when they accidentally got transported there due to their basement DIY navigator. just noticed that the new avengers squad has/will have a lot more teenagers now (hawkeye's prodigy?, casey with her pym suit, ms. marvel)"
"Apr 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Another example of Marvel underestimating their fan's intelligence. But it's their fan's fault anyway.
"Apr 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,Awful movie. Good actors given a truly terrible script. Only watched to the end so I could finish my chocolate. Leave this one alone!!!
"Apr 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,Maybe the most disappointing Marvel movie to date. The writing and quality has gotten really lazy with Marvel lately. 
"Apr 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was a good movie but, I didn't love it like some Marvel movies but, I still enjoyed it. If it wasn't for M.O.D.O.K being so dumb in this movie I would've probably liked it even more. That being said it does have two post credit scenes like any MCU movie does and it made me more excited with what's coming next moving forward."
"Apr 13, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a good movie and amazing in IMAX or high definition.  The story was engaging and rarely slacked.  Fight scenes were good and better visually than Avatar in my opinion.  Solid acting compared to the last installment which was difficult to watch.  The bad guy steals the show.  Amazing performance that makes this a must watch.
"Apr 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Paul Rudd has done it once again 
"Apr 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Umm idk...I was not a fan.  Probably one of my least favorite Marvel films so far.  Which is sad, because I actually liked the first Ant-Man movie."
"Apr 13, 2023",POSITIVE,very enjoyable movie.
"Apr 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Please more ‚ÄûStrong Woman"""
"Apr 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"My Pikachu: And to think the best movies of 2023 are the ones with the lowest scores on rotten tomatoes 
My Espeon ( Sofinea ): it is a bit of trend for most movies these day 
Me: And I actually loved almost everything about this from the mutieverse and quantum realm themselves as well as most of the build ups and some of the most unforgettable character arcs 
My Butterfree ( Wormy ): And it's especially the case with Cassie Lang as well as Darlene it's only let down by a slow beginning and most of the stuff don't officially connect until the 2nd half 
Me: And I will admit Scott Lang as ant man himself is a bit unlikable in this movie but he still makes up for it In the end as you said in the 2nd half. But yah The Ant Man himself is somehow the weakest of the Lang family and not just In his family 
Me & Sofinea: We still loved that novel too in the beginning and the end üòΩüò∏ ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢ * hugs each other 
Me: But anyways if we were to give it a rating it's still surprisingly a 10/10
My Pikachu: it's still closer to a 9 then larger though god bless us all with this movie Cassie also our favorite character being from some is actually and not all of us especially in our family had seen it 
My Brionne ( Poppy ): Well I did and just a grand and exciting as both the mutieverse and quantum realm at well. How about you 
Story: 10/10
Visuals &/OR Animation: 10/10
Characters: 9/10
Overall: 10/10"
"Apr 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was great as the starting of phase 5. It made a good starting . I will not say it's the best , but as a start we ca accept it . Although many scene were predictable still it was amazing , Specially, all of the Kang scenes were top class . His acting and overall evrything was great. You will find some scenes lame now . But it's ovbiously one time watch for sure. You will enjoy it though !"
"Apr 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,um filme divertido para ver em fam√≠lia mas como tem um prop√≥sito de expandir sua cronologia o filme deixa muita ponta solta e furos de roteiro
"Apr 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Can we get a believable super hero movie for once?  Kang destroys everything, the end!  Oh and can MODOK be more of a dick please?  Or perhaps rename him, idiot who kills nothing...  Can they kill off Cassie yet?   I know ant man would melt down but I would enjoy that more than anymore screen time for her."
"Apr 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Mediocre Marvel movie.  MODOK was a wasted opportunity.  Meh, it passed the time."
"Apr 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not bad, not good. 
As all marvel movies, I like how they include real science facts. 
This movie is pretty standard, good vs evil, some comical relief, hero moments, plot armor, etc."
"Apr 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was a good movie but didnt bring anything new to the marvel movies
"Apr 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,not as bad as people say. i really do recommend
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-man and the wasp quantumania es una pelicula muy buena que recomiendo mucho. El inicio est√° un poco lento pero despu√©s se pone buena la trama. Siento que el villano principal, Kang El Conquistador lleg√≥ casi por la mitad de la pel√≠cula, me hubiera gustado que saliera como a 1/4 de la pelicula (Bueno, si aparece pero son flashbacks y yo no cuento eso) M.O.D.O.K. s√≠ esta un poco mucho raro, pero luego te acostumbras. Quantumania es muy buena y a pesar de todo, me encant√≥"
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was my favourite of the MCU post end game, I've really not liked any of the other movies so far so good to have some hope that not all is lost."
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the film. These critics are just grumpy for no good reason.
"Apr 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bored at the beginning bored in the middle and bored at t‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,First Marvel movie I've enjoyed this much since End Game. This is what a GREAT Marvel movie looks like and I really hope there is more to come from Ant Man.
"Apr 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Deixou a desejar, saiu muito do protagonista, focando mais em outros personagens.
Achei um filme totalmente esquec√≠vel, onde n√£o me encantou em nada. N√£o teve cenas empolgantes, cenas que eu desse muita risada, apenas um filme para entender algumas coisas do mundo cinematografico da MARVEL.
Bom para passar o tempo, mas nada al√©m disso."
"Apr 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"And this is how Marvel announced the disaster phase 5 will be. Paul Rudd is Ant-Man, but unfortunately he was giving a mediocre-toxic-daddy back seat role by some mediocre writers and he had to comply....just like Hemsworth had to suffered through the painful, ridiculous, and absurdly insufferable story Taika Waititi did on Love and Thunder. To which I still cannot believe they convinced Christian Bale (THE Christian Bale) to be part of. Is time for Marvel to start showing some respect towards their actors."
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I know i'm late to the party but I Just watched it and i got to say it's soooo much better then it was perceived to be in the media. Great movie that tells a great story and builds on the Kang storyline. Must see for Marvel fans.
"Apr 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,IL film fa schifo √® noioso e ant-man non mi piace come supereroe. Mi √® piaciuta una sola scena.
"Apr 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,The wors movie that marvel has do in the mcu
"Apr 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was... a very mixed bag.
For the way Quantumania was being marketed, it made it seem like it was going to be this big introduction to Kang and his role in the future of the MCU and Scott was going to fall prey to him, but neither of those really happened. The beginning and ending of this movie felt rushed. They jumped into the Quantum Realm within the first like 5 minutes of the movie, and I feel like there was a missed opportunity to catch up with familiar Ant-Man characters that were part of the heart and humor that made this series one of my favorites(Luiz and his friends). A lot of the jokes felt very badly timed and quite often weren't even that funny(particularly when MODOK is attacking Kang; that felt like a twelve year old's script writing). The middle of the movie felt the strongest; one of the best scenes in the entire movie is when Scott and Cassie meet Kang for the first time. He actually feels intimidating and it genuinely felt like they'd been backed into a corner where they had to help him escape the Quantum Realm or everything they loved would be destroyed. But the third act did Kang dirty. He was defeated by a bunch of ants whom the writer forgot about for a full hour and conveniently come back super smart. Kang was described as a man with technology ahead of everyone, and this provides for a rather hard-to-believe-defeat at the hands of dozens of ants that have gotten smarter going through the Quantum field or something along the lines of that. I'm also not usually one to bag for a character's death or anything, but if they wanted to make Kang feel like a legitimate threat, one of the major characters of this film's cast should've died, or at the very least Hope and Scott should've been left in the Quantum Realm until we see them again in Kang Dynasty. Overall I thought the move was fine, it's light years better than Multiverse of Madness which failed its characters in every way possible and Eternals that completely failed to make me care about too many new characters, but there's much to be improved upon if the writer for this one is truly writing Avengers: Kang Dynasy."
"Apr 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was an interesting movie, it was really shark boy and lava girl"
"Apr 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I mean, Marvel fans we enjoy it, kind of. It's just what we expected, nothing new or something that keeps people interested. Good villain, mediocre main characters, bad to super bad second characters, inconsistent story, horrible VFX; I don't know, watch it only if you are bored and you know well de MCU."
"Apr 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,i dont like how they killed off kang
"Apr 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cassie is cringey, the plot is lowkey ass except the parts were Kang is in."
"Apr 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Movie sucks big time! Special effects, Cgi and Side Characters are the only reason this movie made money! Also Jonathan Majors as Kang too!"
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Fun to watch and just enjoy! As per usual critics are out of touch with the everyday person.
"Apr 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Im a huge Marvel Movie fan. This was my least favorite of them all. Seemed like some generic space movie. A few funny moments, but a lot of jokes that fell flat. Just seemed like a lazy effort from Marvel. And, Kang seems like a boring villain."
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I like how the special effects are used in this movie.
"Apr 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fun, but its missing real Ant Man Stuff, his Daughter could be handeld better. Kang was awesome, but overall not a great Movie experience."
"Apr 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel movie is getting worse.
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,action packed from start to finish
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Lots of CGI, but it all made sense. Paul Rudd was hilarious as always."
"Apr 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was good but the plot was bland.
"Apr 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie itself was great, but the toddler behind me was very annoying. I haven't had to deal with excess noise during a movie in a very long time."
"Apr 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,just wait till it come out on redbox
"Apr 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The artistry & special effects were amazing. However, some reminded me of Star Wars & Pandora. The storyline was a little odd. How did a killing machine use their signal to get them into the quantum realm? Loved the ants story though."
"Apr 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movies graphic is more exquisite, and something you can imagine of the little quantum world may prevail. Something that the Marvel Cinematic Universe never Disappoint.   For those Marvel Fans, this movie is the new toe step to take and prepare for the Multiverse Saga. But for those ""Movie as Enjoyment"" i please guide to understand and venture on Family (Dad and Daughter Relationship) which is more portrayed and shows how far and what measure the parent goes to ensure to secure the good aura with their children."
"Apr 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fun but the writing was not deep enough for my liking. 
"Apr 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super sch√∂ner Film, typisch f√ºr Marvel. Spannend und tolle Spezialeffekte.
Kann man auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen."
"Apr 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really great. The multiversal storylines are going to be so awesome
"Apr 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Disappointing! Expected more
"Apr 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,Go why to introduce Kang and a good why to start phase 5. This move made me love MODOK as a character and I hope there was more of them.
"Apr 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,Decent movie but I expected more. The all-star cast didn‚Äôt get an ample opportunity to develop and truly showcase their talents. It was a nice run for Marvel but I think their time has come to an end.
"Apr 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,Man oh man. Superhero fatigue is real‚Ä¶.
"Apr 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"i really don't know where all the negative reviews are coming from. this movie is an absolute hit. the details are amazing, it's humorous, good plot. of course it's ""all over the place"" in some sorts because it's literally taking place in the quantum realm, things aren't supposed to make sense. it's great!!"
"Apr 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"A wonderfully realized follow-up to Ant-Man and the Wasp as wells as Ant-Man's appearance in Endgame. Taking place mostly in the beautifully rendered quantum realm, it feels like a giant dream sequence that takes place in a hyper weird Star-Wars like galaxy. As with all Ant-Man films the comedy is there and the Lost in Space Robinson family vibe is there with the newly introduced Janet Van Dyne mixing it up with Hank Pym as Scott and his daughter continue their relationship post-Thanos' snap. The whole thing is big, epic, over-the-top fun. But the family dynamic somehow keeps the feel of the film small and intimate, like the other Ant-Man films. Majors' Kang steals the show every time he's on screen as all great villains should. And this is the perfect film to connect with the wackiness of the Loki series. Make sure you stay until the very end of the credits to see completion of the film as well as a hint of what's to come. I highly recommend seeing this in IMAX if you can, and in 3D to take advantage of all the visuals."
"Apr 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Yes, Paul Rudd is his usual comedic self. Yes, seeing acting greats like Michelle Pfeiffer and Kirk Douglas in a superhero movie is a treat. However, the storyline is thin, the CGI feels deja vu, and the villain has no depth or truly complete or compelling backstory for his importance in the next phase of the MCU. The movie has simply shrunk down in enjoyment and inventiveness from the previous two films."
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,A great Marvel Movie and a Must See! I think He's a little much for Ant Man but the Effects in this movie were awesome!
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a huge impact from the thor love and thunder failure. Honestly this movie was a huge success. I love how kang got the attention he deserved. I wasn't sure that I would watch another mcu movie after Thor's final F.U. to his fans, however being a huge kang fan from the comics I had too. This was another step back into the right direction and might have saved the MCU from destruction."
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Over all I really like this film. Although it does not close the Ant-Man trilogy very well and the ending feels pretty unsatisfying and the Cg looks pretty bad sometimes. Also there are some useless characters in this film and some really bad jokes. And for an Ant-Man and the Wasp movie Wasp was barley in this film. Jonathan Mayors was incredible as Kang and Paul Rudd was always great as Ant-Man. Over all a really fun and enjoyable time at the theater and over all all another MCU winner.
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"If it wasn't for these few clich√©s it would be a lot better, but man, this movie explores the worlds and theories that we dream and think of and it does it in a beautiful, imaginative and original way. I had a lot of expectations for this movie, it didn't meet a majority of them but it still is one of the most epic movies worldbuilding-wise."
"Apr 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant man 3 is definitely not one of the best but it is most definitely over hated, Kang is a very entertaining villain and I am excited for what they do with him next, But what I did find a little disappointing was the ending I don't personally think ant man should have died I think he and hope should have been trapped in the quantum realm and they get out in some way in another movie."
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"SO, the premise we already knew from the trailer. The whole Pymm family gets sucked back into the Quantum realm.  The visuals are very VERY similar in CONCEPT to Disney's Strange World, albeit a hyper-realistic take instead of an animations style. The story is about one of the Kings having created an empire in the Quantum Realm and an overthrow. Not quite sure what people were expecting that it's getting low marks. There's not a grain more storyline in Avatar and those have been huge hits <shrug> It has comedic moments without being campy, but they never took it TOO far... Idk. The best way to say it is that I would watch it again if the chance arrises. Thor Love & Thunder (by way of comparison) probably will never make contact with my eyes again."
"Apr 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania starts off with a bang but the storyline just fizzes with unanswered questions. However, the artistry and visual effects are awesome and will keep you entertained."
"Apr 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,Forgettable. The villain was hard-done  by Disney. Good character
"Apr 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"plot was thin with many holes. I don't really understandthe whole Darrin thing, but overall the visual effects and a powerful last 30-40 minutes made the movie worth watching."
"Apr 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not the best. All I can say.
"Apr 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not a bad plot with good acting and a decent amount of jokes land. Watching this I e  this feels like a marvle movie. And not in a bad way it was a good marvle movie like one from 2017
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's not the best Marvel movie, but the complete insanity of it mixed with Jonathan Major's scene-stealing performance as Kang makes for a fun, entertaining movie."
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I think they could do more on the mcu the movie has great effects but the story doesn't have a little sense the introduction of kang Johnatan Mayors is great Paul road also great but I don't like this movie is the opening of the kang dynasty that will be a hit the movie could give more but we got this it's good more and less
"Apr 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,I don't even know why the wasp is in the title‚Ä¶she's barely in it
"Apr 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"La pelicula es mala, efectos especiales malisimos, historia floja y villano desperdiciado. Asi es marvel, arruina sus personajes. Sin embargo, prefiero esta pelicula antes que el bodrio de ms marvel y she hulk, los criticos esos si que les llego el sobre de marvel, la verdad una decepcion esas series. Lo unico rescatable las actrices principales.
Ant man 3 pasara como el declive de marvel para que se de cuenta de que esta haciendo las cosas mal"
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie!!!! But I do agree with the plot being something of a mess but overall it kicks phase 5 off with a bang and I can't wait to see what else Johnathon Majors does with Kang
"Apr 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I had my bar set too high for this one and it really shows.... Ant-Man was fun as always but his friends weren't so much.... Hank and Janet were cool and had their moments but weren't used very much. Cassie was done dirty with the script and overall arc her character went through. The Wasp did f all and it was pointless having her name in the title of the film. Also, Bill Murray was wasted af. Kang was the highlight but even then I felt that he was underutilized and lacking as a character. MODOK was funny but looked really goofy. It was fun and genuinely good but don't expect an Endgame level movie or even villain."
"Apr 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,creo q la formula de marvel empieza agotarse
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yet another fantastic adventure within the MCU, Antman & the Wasp: Quantumania will not disappoint a true Marvel fan. While the story had its minor flaws, it overall gives us an idea of where the MCU is heading. Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd shine bright as Kang and Ant-Man in this film; and will leave fans craving for whatever may come next."
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very good. Stay for both post scenes!
"Apr 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie felt a lot like Star Wars and  Jonathan Majors acting was menacing I'd say this movie is pretty good but nothing life changing.
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, hope there's another"
"Apr 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel has no more time to do much with the MCU anymore. I have a lot of things to say about this movie, but as a quick review for right now, I would simply call it ""ant barf"". The plot was not good, the writing was so bad, jokes didn't land for me at all,(unlike the other two Ant-Man films, but not shocking), the high stakes for this movie wasn't my cup of tea, fight scenes actually sucked, Paul Rudd was in a Quantum prison which held back his charm for this production and there were barely any good character arcs to close the story. Oh yeah, THERE WASN'T A GOOD STORY FOR THE CHARACTERS TO WORK WITH! This was supposed to be THE BIGGEST AND BEST ANT-MAN FILM! COME ON DISNEY AND MARVEL, WHY RUSH IT? M.O.D.O.K was the side joke, I will not make myself write a book about Cassie Lang in this film, and Jonathan Major's Kang to me is the main joke of the film. After I watched this film, I look back on the ""Marvel + Disney"" idea from years ago, thinking now that it was such a bad idea to begin with."
"Apr 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,It had a decent plot. I would recommend it!
"Apr 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,I was very excited to see this movie but the story didn't deliver.
"Apr 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nice plot, good jokes, awesome action and finally AMAZING final battle in ant-man movie. Good movie for watching with kids"
"Apr 4, 2023",POSITIVE,loved this movie. it was FANTASTIC!!!!
"Apr 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Depois de Doutor Estranho, esse filme sem d√∫vidas ganha como o pior filme da Marvel. Morivo? Simplesmente pq criaram um vil√£o imposs√≠vel de se destruir, ent√£o sem mt criatividade, colocaram a coisa mais rid√≠cula do mundo vencendo o vil√£o, formigas!
Ele j√° matou in√∫meros vingadores, destruiu milhares de terra? Oq importa? Formigas gigantes s√£o capazes de td!
Obs: Pq o nome √© Homen Formiga e Vespa? Se a Vespa t√° sumida do rol√™?"
"Apr 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Paul Rudd can do no wrong!
"Apr 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Honestly, I had fairly low expectations going into this one.  The critic reviews are pretty poor and box office performance has been weak.  It may have been for that reason, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Paul Rudd is a entertaining as ever and there were plenty of fun and exciting moments.  I enjoyed the first Ant-Man film more, but I liked Quantumania more than the 2nd entry in the series."
"Apr 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie.  Although it is becoming a complex franchise, and watching Loki is critical.  This movie is probably not as good without the background of the Loki series."
"Apr 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I love everything Marvel and this movie did not disappoint!
"Apr 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think they did very well with the storyline and the addition of characters that they chose. Continuing the MCU storyline (and their deviations from the comic books) requires filler-movies such as this to keep the overall storyline going.

[Spoilers below, before continuing] 

 I was not displeased with the portrayal of Kang the Conqueror, but do hope that we have not seen the last of him (or Rama Tut, as displayed on the credits.) Same thing with M.O.D.O.K., his new direction with the origin of his character was very different, but made sense with the tineline that the MCU is introducing. That was my greatest grievance with the movie was his introduction (and his exit). I also hope we haven't seen the last if him either, for such a prominent character in Marvel."
"Apr 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's like Star Wars in the MCU. The CGI is amazing. I loved Paul Rudd and the other actors. I saw it in theaters and after Thor love and thunder I was much more satisfied than I was after that trash bag thor 4. The only problemsI had was that it did not have a good ending to The Ant man trilogy. He did not really learn a fresh lesson. He learned the same dang thing over again.  And that Kang was not ase big and bad ase he was hyped up to be. Overall the action was amzing and the jokes were more spaced and the story was clever. I am not done with marvel.
"Apr 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It jumped into a quantum reality that was hard to believe as real.  Of course it's a scifi movie and one expects to suspend reality.  But the way it jumped into it, with the entire Pym family, was not a well-built, believable, story.  Later it became okay.  But the dissonance of 'real' world to 'quantum' world even had my kids scratching their heads.

The characters were okay.  Some good action scenes.  Funny moments.  But a bit too much of ""believe this immediately"" to be a really good Marvell movie."
"Apr 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie isn't bad and it is overhated but I wouldn't recommend it either but Majors is a W and I can't wait for more of him in the MCU
"Apr 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was one of the better film for this stage. The visuals, humour and actions are here, but the ending was quite generic. It's a standard hero movie, there were no surprises but it's not a boring one. I'd watch it once but not twice."
"Apr 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Some of the CGI was not fitting. Kinda gave a Spy Kids vibe or Sharkboy and LavaGirl. Otherwise the movie was great! Hope to see more of Kang!
"Apr 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I like this movie look I know the cgi is a little wacky but I like it
"Apr 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was good. Not like the first two. But, it was worth watching in theaters. I'm a big MCU fan so I take these movies seriously. Would I see it a second time in theaters, no. But overall it was good"
"Apr 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent installment of the MCU. Much bigger scale than the usual Ant-Man/Wasp movies. Felt like a Star Wars film in spots. Loved it.
"Apr 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I had been looking forward to learning about the Quantum Realm but found this movie's portrayal to be underwhelming.  Many of the beings in this realm are freakish and bizarre, far more so than necessary.  If you are a big Marvel fan, you will probably enjoy the movie, as the character of Kang is fascinating and there is good action throughout the movie."
"Apr 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: The unnecessary intro to Kang that is complete garbage! Visual effects are okay, but the plot and its justifications are just total jokes. Unfunny, boring, feels like a lame mixture of Star Wars and other pop-culture references that do not work. By the way, next time you want to introduce a massive villain who is almost presented as a supreme god, try not to wash him off at the end using the power of ant friendship and Michael Douglas' dull performance."
"Apr 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it üòä cool scenery and some funny commentary and a bit of action
"Apr 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Unlike most, I actually really enjoyed this film and thought it was a good start for MCU's Phase 5. A lot of good humor and action."
"Apr 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie. The movie feels me charm. The most iconic part of this movie is that it introduced us the villain Kang played by Jonathan Majors, which shows that a new and powerful villain after Thanos will proof a new threat to the MCU, which will be shown in the upcoming movies. Surely this is not the end of Kang. He will return. And I'm truly excited to watch him again."
"Apr 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A strong and clear progression of the Antman story arc, with clear themes regarding family and overcoming adversity."
"Apr 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I really wanted to like this one but it was a bit flat. ""drink the ooze"" was the best part. It didn't really feel like an Ant-Man movie. Thought it was a bit too dark, literally and figuratively. We were also in the quantum realm for 97% of the movie and I felt like it needed to be broken up a bit more somehow to give different settings. It kind of felt like a trudging through the quantum realm. I love the MCU but felt like it missed the mark. I'll give it another chance when it hits streaming!"
"Apr 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"There is a lot of familiar tropes to this addition to the Ant-Man franchise. It's very Doctor Who and Dune / Star Warsy, with a bit of Honey I Shrunk the Kids, and easy enough to enjoy without much metaverse knowledge. Paul Rudd is always easy to watch, but there is nothing particularly memorable to this one."
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely love the storyline being set up for Ant Man. we are finally getting to see these characters at their best. I highly recommend all to watch. Please disregard the people being negative, most of their reviews seem heavily biased. If you're a rotten tomato commoner, I'm sure you knew that already."
"Apr 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not as funny as the first or second movie. Too much 'pew-pew-pew' CGI with half-second cuts, couldn't tell what was happening for the most part. Convoluted storyline with non-sensical motivations for people's actions."
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was an incredible movie, and an amazing edition to the Ant Man franchise! It was such a fun time with the action, suspense, and mystery. I felt like it had so much charm in it's world building with the Quantum Realm. The characters were also likeable, especially the main villain, Kang. He's so threatening and an worthy successor to Thanos as the next big bad for the MCU. This movie was a great start to Marvel Phase 5, and I'm hopeful that they'll keep it up! Highly recommended, if you haven't watched it yet!"
"Apr 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,First I think this movie is a little over hated. Not drastically but people hate it because yeah its cheesy corny and a little slow but still very enjoyable. In the middle between mid and solid for me.
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked everything the story, technology, special effects, creatures. Etc.."
"Apr 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,I really enjoyed this movie Johnathan Majors killed it he was so good there was some bad parts in this movie there was one part just one where the CGI was just awful but I think this sets up kang for the rest of phase 5 and beyond
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"A completely overrated movie- it was great, I loved the performances and story. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't feel like an ant-man movie. Going in, I was hoping for an ant-man movie but I got something completely different. Just a shame because I did like the first two movies and wish the third one continued the consistent style and tone. Not wat I was expecting, but good for what it is."
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie! They can't defeat kang ! I enjoy this movie so much! This is my favourite marvel fan!
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it. Funny jokes, interesting plot, wasnt like Sharkboy and Lavagirl very much except maybe the head"
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"First of all, it is a great leap for Scott Lang's Ant Man from the previous two movies. I had been waiting for this movie for quite a long time, and today finally I had the opportunity to watch it!
!!!! SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!
The movie lived up to my expectations, shocked me in quite a few scenes. The dive into the quantum world was an amazing one with stunning visuals, one could have never thought of! And watching in 3D, made it even more immersive! We however got to see a little bit of MODOK, eventually before he decided to fight against the conqueror!
The plot was perfectly planned, with little jokes, and sudden moments building tension, and they are unpredictable. The people, their bond with Jane's family made the story line an even better! Jonathan Major's performance as KANG was phenomenal üéâ!
After Endgame, the battle scenes of Ant Man 3 were so amazing and brilliant! The army of the Conqueror vs all of the quantum people. You could see a glimpse of how extremely powerful the ""CONQUEROR"" was, and what he could do! At moments it was the whole crowd cheering during the final battle and it was  peacefully satisfying to watch!
The mid credit scene was a link to ""AVENGERS KANG DYNASTY"", which will shock you as infinite no of Kang variants are preparing for war! which makes me think that Thanos was also a puzzle for something greater and there are greater threats in the whole ""MULTIVERSE"", as ""HE WHO REMAINS"" once said in Loki S01, which is yet to come, and partly it gives an idea of ""SECRET WARS"".
The post credit scene, We see Loki and Morbius attending a sort of lecture of Kang, which I think is picked from one of the scenes in Loki S02.
TBH, I don't know why people are talking negative about this movie, when there is nothing to criticize it. You know it's all a part in the puzzle setting up the big story!(and nowadays it's is a trend to hate movies by critics and audience!)
I give this movie a 10/10"
"Mar 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Controversy and all, Johnathan Majors MCU big screen debut is a major hit!"
"Mar 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,WAY TOO MUCH GOING ON IN THIS 2 PLUS HOUR MESS!!!!  MAKEUP ON MICHELLE IS RIDICULOUS!!!  SHE'S BEEN TRAPPED FOR 30 YEARS IN HELL????  THIS MOVIE IS NOT WORTH SEEING BY ANYONE WHO IS NOT 10 YEARS OLD!!!!
"Mar 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was so boring, to many implicit sexual insinuations, and not fun to watch. It's like the new trending for all the Marvel Movies lately, they all sucks"
"Mar 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Underwhelming. Felt like more of the same, no creativity and character depth as shallow as a puddle"
"Mar 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Ant-Man film & a Wonderful set-up for ahead!
"Mar 31, 2023",POSITIVE,https://youtu.be/3oeSlG4ABoY
"Mar 30, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this was a fun comedy superhero movie. I think the critics were expecting a different kind of movie for some reason.
"Mar 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not necessarily a bad film, but nowhere near as good as the other ant man movies. When you take away the light hearted comedy setting of San Francisco, and remove the funniest characters, the movie isn‚Äôt funny."
"Mar 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible, i couldn't watch it. from the most ridiculous plot twist to the most lame characters. story is confusing, unoriginal and just plain boring, i expected way more from marvel"
"Mar 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"After a phase of introductions and experiments, we now enter considerably a penultimate phase in Marvel's Multiversal Saga. While Phase Two evolved the heroes in the Infinity Saga, Phase Five responds to establishments that gets officially connected, therefore evolving the stories towards a multiversal war and heightening the characters' cynical awareness as new patterns comes to light. There is the saga's own speculative endgame, but instead of stones popping up in a prophetic pattern, it is now more unknown on what strategy is being played through the main big bad's own presence. Phase starters usually give off a tonal impression as a first part in a narrative. So how does ""Quantumaia"" serve? While Thanos appears inactive with a threatening aura, his backstory is formally told in his film ""Infinity War"" whereas he became active finally showing true capability. If his successor is decidedly getting explored and is already active just as a phase starts, after a pre-established reveal, there is certainly a bigger, complex game plan at play. Besides that being a definitive core takeaway, how does ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: QuANTuMANia"" functions overall?

In this third solo chapter capping off the Ant-Man trilogy, romantically power duo Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne been living the high life just changing the world and inspiring others from their endeavors as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Their new challenge, mainly Scott's, is raising his now teenage daughter Cassie as she rebels for what she thinks is right, while influenced by the Van Dyne's genius lineage. This lead to her communicating the quantum realm, much to Janet Van Dyne's panic soon justified as they got sucked back into the unpredictable realm. Separated and must find each other while gripping the senses of where they are, they encounter untouched strangeness, all under an empirical reign of a formidable foe who knows all while also trapped.

Apparently per tradition, the Ant-Man films are about fun and refreshing without much consequence besides bringing in new heroes. ""Ant-Man"" followed ""Age of Ultron"", ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" followed ""Infinity War"", now ""Quantumania"" followed ""Wakanda Forever"". Tense films dramatically heighten stakes to weigh down on us, then next time we go to the cinema to check out the newest chapter it eases while functioning more like the interconnected franchise's comedic central, joking the phrase that size matters, amid expected action-packed deliverance. This installment mostly maintains the notion as a ride of unpredictable spectacle on a cautiously edgier but inferior note. Director Peyton Reed tasked himself with knowledgeable grip of the microverse capably finalized on a satisfying note over familiar elements that serves as tribute dating back to the first chapter like how most trilogies go for. He challenged himself as the films literally gotten smaller and smaller from above ground to going subatomic into the quantum realm at equal exploration, along with [appropriate characterization] without many checks, while enlarging the kinetically complex action sequences ‚Äì music composer Christophe Beck follows suit. As we venture the quantum realm after brief visits and passing through, it maps out similarly in akin to Star Wars between characteristic visuals and brief themes such as class conflict being the main idea beneath morality depending on rebellious survival.

Unlike the two direct predecessors, this film did not quite match their level of being top-notched. The more prominent element is the writing, which comes the pacing when structuring the story, that generated the fun and helps the characters shine. There is no writing team this time as it has become an independent project penned by Jeff Loveness, known for ""Rick & Morty"" wherein the favorably toxic animated series' humorous senses can be ideally felt which proves unfit and just turned eventfully sour. Loveness is experienced in blending in different worlds and how to interact with embodied strangeness, but the coerced, cringey humor occasionally seen actually fit elsewhere once you visualize some certain moments, including climatic shortcuts, and awkward pacing all rightfully belong in Loveness's other associated projects, just not in this one. Even so, he also seems to acknowledge the impactful growth that the solo films built off of each other and managed to give off an ideal impression of the coming stakes ‚Äì with humorous cynicism, whereas he at least gave them a chance to display their resilient strength.

Despite the inferiority within the given screenplay, the cast managed to make the best of it. General expectation for Michael Douglas over his casual caliber in an effortless charismatic performance with pleasant humor when he graces these films considering his stature. Michelle Pfieffer shines as we get to explore more of her character Janet through intriguing unfolding as she has been poised to be most knowledgeable in the given stakes but reluctant to answer because of the danger they pose. Evangeline Lilly independently evolved her character Hope, while fulfilling the wholesomeness of her chemistry with Paul Rudd who performed at his charismatically comedic usual but leveled with gravitas when things gotten personal. Without spoiling a turnout, despite Lilly already unveiled the involvement, but one returning performer reminisces the return like a switch, even though performing exaggeratedly and unable to uplift the role limited by the subpar screenplay in certain scenes.

The film features a new cast with Jonathan Majors returning from ""Loki"", Kathryn Newton replacing Emma Fuhrmann, and Bill Murray in a small but significant role. Murray only appeared in one scene as a typically eccentric guy from Pfieffer's past, and he performed smoothly like a pleasant, worthy inclusion hinting he is glad to be a part of the ride, with the feeling being mutual. His role is predictably akin to what he did in ""The City of Ember"". Newton portrays Scott's grown daughter Cassie, unceremoniously replacing Fuhrmann from ""Endgame"" but arguably reasonable when suitably fitting into the character's rebellious shoes like a walk in the park with her needed caliber, and she succeeds acceptably. Finally, Majors returns as a variant of his ""Loki"" character He Who Remains but formally Kang the Conqueror, Thanos's successor as Marvel's next big bad, and how he brought the character to life is just mesmerizing as there is terror in his veins beneath his humane masquerade as felt previously. Kang's thoroughly cinematic introduction is the most compelling and the main takeaway from this film as Majors exceptionally performed with enough gravity to solidify his position, fueling excitement for what else to come in the coming media.

""Quantumania"" heightens but remains small in comparison to its direct predecessors, as well the other Phase starters despite being just as impressionably impactful, especially returning to ominous form by transition as well connectively functioning similar to ""Iron Man"" by showing a clear overall path that would soon affect other heroes through the next two phases. The concluding dialogues made sure to linger then remain in our thoughts after leaving the theater till next time and just to wonder how others are going to connect. After everything, the film may have not ranked high as expected, but thankfully not the least just way above ""Eternals"" and ""Love and Thunder"", it managed to define the Marvel-ous averageness in its entertainment value with unpredictable spectacle and continuous fun. (B+)

Before seeing this, it is best to consider ""Loki"" as a prerequisite viewing."
"Mar 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall, while it's exciting for audiences to witness the Quantum Realm in all of its glory and finally gain an introduction to the mysterious Kang The Conqueror, I'm saddened to say Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is a weak entry to phase five. I was less emotionally invested in the leads or most of the story than in some of the prior Marvel films. Jonathan Majors shines wonderfully as the new leading nemesis. I also felt thankful and surprised to see actress Michelle Pfeiffer gaining more of a screen presence, and she, too, is quite enjoyable here. The effects are great, but naturally, green screens are used heavily throughout most of the film. This, combined with the audio sound effects, the various creatures and ships reminded me heavily of the Star Wars universe, which I found distracting. In the end, there's still a great story but I can't deny that I was left feeling somewhat disappointed when compared to the past Marvel films."
"Mar 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,I‚Äôve never been an Ant man fan but this movie wasn‚Äôt half bad. I believe it‚Äôs because it has some Star Wars vibes.
"Mar 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I had pretty low expectations when is came to quANTaMANia because of their mostly mediocre entries, and I sadly this one was also mediocre. I loved Kang and Ant-Man and loved exploring the Quantum Realm, and honestly I thought having M.O.D.O.K. be Yellowjacket was a great idea, but they just make him way to goofy and way too out of character. The story isn't the greatest either and the rest of the characters were just sidelined way too much and just forgettable. But it's not a bad movie."
"Mar 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film is slated for release in February 2023, and it is a highly anticipated sequel to 2018's Ant-Man and the Wasp. Directed by Peyton Reed, the film promises to continue the story of Scott Lang, Hope van Dyne, and Hank Pym as they navigate the quantum realm and battle new villains. The film's cast includes returning stars Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Douglas, as well as newcomers like Kathryn Newton and Jonathan Majors. With its blend of action, humor, and sci-fi, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is sure to be a thrilling addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Mar 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Great storyline and plot. Special effects also great. Overall fun movie.
"Mar 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"What they did to MODOK was an atrocity. Otherwise, good movie."
"Mar 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Despite being kinda of funny sometimes, this movie is pretty bland and has a weak story that did not interest me at all."
"Mar 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Antman and The Wasp: Quantomania is a quintessential Marvel Studios production, the leading superhero powerhouse (though we shouldn't overlook the occasional entertaining offerings from Sony and Warner Bros.' DC Universe). Now in Phase 5, Marvel's shared universe of superheroes is set to introduce the formidable villain Kang the Conqueror, who disrupts and shapes the journeys of our less-renowned heroes.

In a way, Antman is like a modern-day Gulliver's Travels, encapsulating the best and worst of Marvel in a single film. It's a grand family adventure with a therapeutic twist, as characters uncover family secrets, experience emotional breakthroughs, and strengthen their bonds. The climax features a father's ultimate sacrifice for his daughter's life, proving that unity can overcome even the greatest evil. And don't miss the tiny surprise at the end!

While much discussion revolves around box office numbers, superhero fatigue, and self-perpetuating YouTube channels, I won't delve into that. Instead, I'll focus on the fact that Antman Quantomania is a delightful family film that wraps up its story arc while foreshadowing the darker future of Marvel and other superhero franchises. As the children who grew up watching these tales mature, movies filled with childlike wonder may no longer guarantee success. The audience now craves more sophisticated content, or perhaps the films have become stale with overused plots and tropes. Or maybe these movies were always meant to be simple tales of wonder for children of all ages.

Regardless, we may grow older, but our heroes remain timeless for each new generation to enjoy."
"Mar 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ant-Man was an exciting and entertaining watch which is what you should want in any Marvel film. It will be interesting to see what they do in the future in the Marvel universe.
"Mar 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved The Movie... Lots Of action and adventure...
"Mar 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is ok. Not a bad watch. Just something you watch once and years later, you go through all the marvel movies and watch it again. Not a bad storyline, just not a big ant man fan. Recommending this movie is you don't have anything better to do."
"Mar 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Standard super hero movie 
"Mar 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great ride in the MCU!
"Mar 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I love the character of Ant Man and the visual effects and humor was spot-on in this movie. But, the plot was lackluster, as was the main antagonist. It seemed like Ant Man and the other heroes in the movie weren't really needed-- a little anti-climactic. Overall, it was a good watch, but it really felt like a ""stepping stone"" for the next Marvel ""End Game"" then a stand-alone movie."
"Mar 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"After the first two movies in the Ant-Man series, this one is the third where the audience will learn about the quantum realm, and the new supervillain who will shake the MCU universe having a creative plan that will undoubtedly surprise you!
When we are aware of Kang the villain's motivations and history, Jonathan Majors portrays him extremely effectively. The acting of Majors is also extremely impressive. In comparison to the earlier sections, the primary cast of characters may also be deemed to be forward-thinking. The storyline for this episode, which features a major supervillain for the first time, is, if anything, even worse than that of the previous ones. It seems plausible that when Infinity conflict concludes, the MCU would experience a significant conflict dubbed Secret War based on the way Kang exhibits his dominance throughout the movie. However, near the conclusion of the film, look at how this Kang variation was beaten! Ridiculous! It's as if the crew is leading you and you hope he'll be a nice man along the road, but that coolness is quickly discarded by the screenplay authors. Like many other superhero films of the same type, including those made by Marvel, this writing is fairly slack. The quantum universe is also introduced as a brand-new idea, but it isn't really explored in depth in this film.
All things considered, this film nevertheless has good graphics, CGI, vibrant sound, and humorous situations with Ant-Man and his family in the quantum realm. This film is guaranteed to satisfy if you go to the theater with the intention of having fun and are aware of Marvel's current state of affairs. It will frustrate you if you're a Marvel aficionado or have spent years researching it, though. Marvel has to upgrade their whole scripting process for the next projects."
"Mar 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was great, many different characters, while all being talented, every single one had some flaws, moreover, they all needed eachother, which is a valuable lesson that I'm guessing the tomato critics couldn't accept since it doesn't present a world where women are perfect and straight white men are either evil or dumb."
"Mar 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Weak movie, average script saved only by the interpretation of the cast and special effects, finally a shadow to Marvel movies"
"Mar 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a great start into going more deep in the Multiverse Saga. The acting from Paul Rudd and Jonathon Majors was amazing. This movie was great in starting something new however, it wasn't great as an Ant-Man movie or finishing the trilogy. However, in terms of just a good superhero movie, I think this movie is nice and doesn't deserve the hate it is getting. I would give this a 7.5/10"
"Mar 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"My least favorite Marvel. I‚Äôve watched the first two Ant-man movies dozens of times. The original Ant-man was one of my favorite Marvel movies. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever watch this one again. More like a bad Star Wars episode than a Marvel movie.  Not funny, not exciting, no Michael Pena. Too much Michelle Pfeiffer, who looked bored throughout."
"Mar 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great adventure with the ant family.
"Mar 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,I feel like this movie was just a very long episode. With that said after the next Marvel films come out I think we will go back and realize how important and good this film really was.
"Mar 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not as bad as critics say. 
Still, the movie doesn't bring anything, too much CGI, that is sometimes very bad !
Katheryn Newton  is acting very bad. 
Not even talking about that ""MCU humour""

Michelle Pfeiffer pretty much carried the movie"
"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great acting all around. Wasn‚Äôt too interested in the movie when it was announced but I really enjoyed the whole thing.
"Mar 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily reprise their roles as Scott Lang/Ant-Man and Hope van Dyne/The Wasp. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer return as Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne, respectively, while Kathryn Newton replaces Abby Ryder Fortson as an older Cassie Lang. Creed III actor Jonathan Majors stars as the terrifying Kang the Conqueror, while Cory Stoll returns from Ant-Man as Darren Cross.

Quantumania is much darker than its predecessors, and the opening scene in the Quantum Realm proves it. To start the third Ant-Man movie in a subatomic universe is an interesting contrast to the previous entries.

Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang the Conqueror is the highlight of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. From the moment he shows up in the movie's opening, he brings an ominous performance that leaves audiences on the edge of their seats. Kang contrasts from Thanos in that he is a danger to not just one, but several universes. This means that defeating him will not guarantee a victory, and Majors delivers that very well. Unfortunately, Kang's presence is downplayed by the string of plotlines sprinkled throughout the movie, and to watch him being defeated by our heroes easily takes away from the threat characters say he is. 

Newton's performance as Cassie Lang is different from Fortson's, and not in a good way. In this movie, she is first seen in a similar situation to Scott in the first movie, being released from jail. Throughout the movie, she and Scott have a less touching relationship than the previous two movies, making it very difficult to like her as a character.

Michelle Pfeiffer's role as Janet van Dyne was frustrating to watch. The character spends most of Quantumania hiding her time in the Quantum Realm from Hope (Lily) and Hank (Douglas). Audiences get to see Janet's history with Kang midway through the movie, but she could have explained this to her family earlier. 

Cory Stoll returns as Darren Cross from the first Ant-Man. In that movie, he was a supervillain you took seriously. In Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania he is called MODOK and is used for comic relief. For this reason, the character's redemption arc did not feel earned. 

The two stingers in the movie featuring different Kang variants and a Loki cameo were entertaining to watch. 

Walking out of the cinema, Quantumania was an eight out of ten movie. After spending time thinking about the film critically, it shrinks down to a six. Consider saving your money on this one."
"Mar 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think this movie is pretty good, I liked it more than the 2nd one (Antman and the Wasp) but a little less than the original, basically Rudd as Antman and Majors as Kang were really good and able to carry this well enough to make up for a somewhat sub par plot, in a nutshell in my opinion it's the best Mcu movie since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness."
"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,We enjoyed the movie.
"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme apresentou um √≥timo contexto, com uma boa narrativa, cgi, o ambiente do reino qu√¢ntico bem apresentado, atua√ß√£o do kang impec√°vel, modok ficou bom na medida, visualmente ficou feio mas isso √© bom pois nos quadrinhos ele √© da mesma forma, enquanto a isso nada a reclamar, s√≥ a falta de motiva√ß√£o pra ele estar no filme, pois ele n√£o faz tanta diferen√ßa estando ali. No mais um bom filme pra da in√≠cio a dinastia kang e eu diria o melhor da franquia do homem formiga. Vale a pena assistir."
"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Best recent MCU movie. Was a standard superhero flick but it was fun with plenty of laughs. Definitely going to rewatch when it drops on Disney+.
"Mar 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,To much Casedy and dad literally half the movie is them to screaming for each other horrible I had high hopes and was disappointed.
"Mar 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,so turned off by today's video game movies.
"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"visual delight, fun, thrills, action all the way"
"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun movie with some subtle adult humor and some unexpected cast members. We enjoyed it!
"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it, it was more like a star wars film rather than a marvel movie. I highly recommend this!"
"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked the movie. Great start to the Kang stuff. 

Modok was the only letdown cause weird CG. It was hard to look at his face"
"Mar 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was skipping and not understandable during the climax and resolve of the movie, highly disappointing to have gone out without being able to watch the important parts"
"Mar 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is one of the worst films iv'e seen in a cinema for years. I went to experience some ultimate IMAX fun at the uk's biggest screen but not even that could save this mess. Absurd plotlines, a villain who we didn't care about or were afraid of, a lot of running and stopping reminiscent of the worst of Doctor Who - and not in a good way. I hear this was made in green screen and distanced partly due to covid - well dialled in perhaps by Zoom did feel like what we saw. At the end of the film we met in the foyer in an angry , yet dazed state and bemoaned the current state of superhero cinema. Instantly forgettable even while you were watching it. and the Moral 'dont be a dick' - really? Bring back the inventive fun of honey I shrunk the kids all is forgiven (well almost)."
"Mar 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,They tried to make it a comedy and it was kind of a kids movie it sucked
"Mar 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,It wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be.
"Mar 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I completely get that this might be a ""controversial"" take as it clearly differs from what lots of people seem to be saying, but I feel like this is the best Ant Man movie I have seen so far. Kang was an extremely interesting villain (although I still can't actually completely understand everything that happened with him, perhaps it was a little confusing) and the main characters all stood out throughout the film and had some amazing moments. One thing I personally didn't like was MODOK, but putting that aside, I thought it was a great movie and I am looking forward to seeing it again when it is released on Disney +"
"Mar 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man 3 was a lighthearted, quantum adventure filled with silly characters and beautiful scenery. Marvel really took their time in casting Jonathan Majors because he was perfect for the role of Kang the Conqueror.* He was my favorite part of the whole movie, but other than that the movie lacks quite a bit.

Edit: After seeing this movie a couple of times‚Ä¶I can confidently say it is one of Marvel's most lackluster releases in the past couple of years. From bad writing to below average performances from Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang, etc. The only redeeming qualities in this film would be Jonathan Majors' Kang the Conqueror who completely stole the movie. *BUTTT Unfortunately for Marvel, he's under investigation for domestic violence. 

With that being said, I was a huge fan of how they handled the quantum realm in terms of locations, creatures, sounds, you name it‚Ä¶it is certainly a place I would love to visit. 
At the end of the day it was a simple family story and that's all I can truly say about it. Simple."
"Mar 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"More watered down mcu schlock, looks ok, but plot is non existent"
"Mar 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Except Rogers, the rest was a sloppy cringe fest"
"Mar 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. LOVED what they did with M.O.D.O.K., a character I thought could never work in live action had me rolling and laughing out loud. My family and I rarely go see movies anymore so this was a great one for us. Also, the way they designed the Quantum Realm was awesome. It had almost a Star Wars feel. I would highly recommend this film! "
"Mar 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing!!!!! Loved it
"Mar 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a very interesting and entertaining movie. It had a lot of unexpected twists and kept us on the edge of our seats. I will definitely watch this movie again sometime.
"Mar 27, 2023",POSITIVE,These critics need a re-evaluation on their job requirements because they're way way way off on this one- QUANTUMANIA IS A VISUAL MASTERPIECE!!! I love this movie so much and it is the perfect way to kick off phase 5!
"Mar 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved every bit of it! Cant wait to watch it again
"Mar 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was pretty good, Nothing spectacular but worth to watch to follow Marvel‚Äôs Phase 5."
"Mar 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was okay, nothing new or different, your typical same old run of the mill super hero movie."
"Mar 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie. Great time per usual for Marvel. Feel bad that Antman is always a filler movie in the MCU‚Ä¶even tho he is a smaller character. Ba-boom-cha! Jokes folks. Might be partial cuz been in love w/Paul Rudd since the 90s but hubby hasn't been & he liked it too.
"Mar 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too much going on, not enough humor"
"Mar 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Mindless dribble at best! Marvel/Disney is a joke now. ‚Ä¶but the joke isn‚Äôt funny. 
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie ! RT critics don't know what they're talking about.  I'd put it 85+ .  There is a lot going on so pay attention but it's one of the best marvel movies out so far !
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,A decent book end to a trilogy of films from Marvel's smallest Avenger. The only issues I had were the boiler plate MCU formula that plagues all the movies it seems.. huge CGI blowouts in the last 15 minutes of the film to resolve the conflict. I was surprised that they didn't add a little more tension at the very end but overall I liked the film. MODOK was well rendered I think what set everyone off on him is that the actor is bald and because of that it was hard to not see just a round ball with a face. The comic MODOK has a full head of hair that breaks up his look but also gives him a more squarish feel.
"Mar 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok miss the supporting cast from first two movies but love model great twist on
"Mar 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, funny and action packed. Surprised to see the timeline, and how it's changed."
"Mar 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's themes and plot seem good on paper, but all ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" shows is Disney's production values and a need to make the MCU bigger than it needs to be."
"Mar 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Solo me gust√≥ Kang. No tiene nada mas destacable.
"Mar 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"... I can tell that Marvel put their money into Wakanda (best movie from Marvel- please check that out, seriously) and not this movie. It was just... eh. I don't know how to describe this movie in words."
"Mar 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The story would have been good but it was overshadowed by the language that was not necessary.  Often it seemed like they were just throwing in curse words to try and appeal to a certain demographic or just to make a point that they could be used in the movie.  Most of the time, they were just pointless.  Dissapointed as it could have been a good movie."
"Mar 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Meh. These superhero movies have run their course. Please stop.
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it. There were some cheesy acting (it's marvel of course) and some bad jokes, or things just thrown in there. But there were a lot of funny parts, and Paul Rudd's acting was solid with Scott, as well as Michelle Pfeiffers. Kang was point on as the antagonist, and his goal and views in the universe were similar to Thanos, so he was fitting as the next big MCU villain. I enjoyed it overall, and was pleasantly surprised because I was nervous to see after the rotten tomato score! The score definitely needs to be adjusted or viewers should be warned it's not accurate. It's not the best MCU movie of course but it's not the worse either."
"Mar 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a good movie, but didn't feel that ""wow"" factor.  Can't put a finger on why I feel this way."
"Mar 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Buena pel√≠cula, no es la gran cosa pero me parece que como m√≠nimo esta aprobada. Es una cinta entretenida, con una trama de la cual esperaba un poco mas ya que parec√≠a que iba a tener a un villano que iba a traer demasiados problemas como lo es Kang, pero finalmente pasa sin pena ni gloria. El reino cu√°ntico que se muestra por momentos me record√≥ a Star Wars, cosa que me gusta pero no me gusto que no se explique nada sobre como llegaron todas esas criaturas ah√≠. Las escenas de Scott y Cassie, son la viva imagen del fuerte lazo padre-hija que tienen, sin embargo no me gusto la qu√≠mica entre ambos, ya que no la note para nada. En cuanto a esto, no me gusto mucho Kathryn Newton en el recast que hicieron de Cassie, me gustaba un poco mas la otra actriz, al menos en lo poco que actu√≥ logro transmitirme mas sentimientos que esta en toda una cinta. Por otro lado, muchos de los efectos especiales se ven bastante mal, y ya es costumbre en Marvel que sea as√≠ lo cual me preocupa. El arco de Janet y Kang me gust√≥, es lo √∫nico serio y valioso que puede haber en esta trama, a pesar de que Kang haya pasado a la lista de villanos de Marvel nerfeados. Tampoco me gusto que es nula la evoluci√≥n que tiene el personaje principal, y el tiempo del d√∫o de Ant-Man y La Avispa es relativamente escaso hasta la batalla final, raro ya que el titulo de la cinta incluye a los dos personajes. Otra de las peores cosas de la pel√≠cula es M.O.D.O.K, con un aspecto horrible que el CGI no acompa√±a nada y con di√°logos muy tontos, no me gusto nada. A pesar de esto tiene cosas buenas, como las escenas post cr√©ditos con algunas sorpresas, buenos personajes secundarios, la trama entretenida y un humor que por momentos funciona. Por ultimo, me falto mencionar la ausencia de Luis en la pel√≠cula, realmente se lo extra√±o y siento que hab√≠a momentos que encajaba perfectamente para que hable o aparezca. En conclusi√≥n, una cinta regular, buena por momentos y con una trama que podr√≠a haber sido mucho mas pero que se quedo en presentarnos a un villano que la verdad no gener√≥ mucho miedo en su tiempo en pantalla; finalmente termina siendo una cinta que a pesar de sus fallas tiene cosas que destacan y yo creo que no la hacen una mala pel√≠cula. La recomiendo."
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great action movie. Loved the actors.
"Mar 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was trying too hard to be star wars
"Mar 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Under the expectations, but it's so entertaining."
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Took while to build the story, special effects were
Good"
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie,  not great"
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly fun movie! Good cinematography, great cast, lots of good laughs throughout.

Helpful to do a refresher on the first two movies, but especially the second."
"Mar 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Storyline was good but Kang character could have been better written.
"Mar 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Didn‚Äôt get to make it too late getting down there
"Mar 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Somehow, Ant-Man movies have lost their charm. The comedy-focused first and second movies made for a lovable cast and enjoyable movie series, however, this has been overriden by high-stakes and blatantly lackluster writing. The first act was great, and set up an interesting movie, but by the end, the dull quantum realm and characters are old and we want to see San Francisco again. There are some positives - the few sequences of comedy did hit, new characters are likeable, and Kang looks like an intriguing villain. Overall, Marvel Studios has delivered a mediocre movie."
"Mar 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolute mess. Disney also decided to bring back an old classic from Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and not actually use the heroes to defeat the villain. Like in the final Star Wars movie, they simply create a couple side armies who have supposedly been there the entire time, and use them to do most of the villain-defeating. Very lazy scriptwriting. On top of this, a villain who has an army of several million (at least) soldiers from the 26th century or beyond, who has the powers to create force fields, vaporize anything basically just by thinking about it, and travel throughout time/in some cases space is defeated by literally the Visigoths, with the help of a few ant-people, and some literal ants."
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,M.O.D.O.K was the glue that made this movie. It's full of laughs and action. Tons of fun for the kids.
"Mar 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,An insult to what the MCU once was.
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Another good Marvel movie. It wasn't the best but still kept you into the adventure.
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it, I think it sets up more than we know can't wait to see what happens next"
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I was unsure with all the mixed reviews but I actually liked it. Kept me entertained...and although it had some corny humour it was actually funny!
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely a must see!! It is filled with action, and the storyline is great."
"Mar 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Bom, o melhor da fase lacro da marvel"
"Mar 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was okay, but the script was very weak in parts.  Not as good as the first two by a long shot."
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Just a good movie with good actors and acting. Can‚Äôt wait to see more marvel movies in the future.
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sensational Sci-fi.  Super fun action. Great characters.  Some plot holes (maybe on purpose to be explained later??). Thrilling, loud, colorful, messy popcorn movie! - Oh yeah - more Wasp please."
"Mar 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm a MCU fan, I was left with a lot of questions. How did Kang not know what the quantum realm was? Many more, but I thought it was okay compared to what they've been putting out lately"
"Mar 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe enters a new phase in its epic series of shows by starting the year with a new movie. After phase four ended I have to admit I wasn't as enthusiastic for phase five. But this includes Paul Rudd's as one-half of the titular role and the promise of an adventure in the multiverse.

Set sometime after Scott Lang played his part in saving the universe in Avengers: Endgame, his life has taken a turn for the best as he is acknowledged as a hero with nods and handshakes, book deals, and a great relationship with his girlfriend, he ends up in another adventure no thanks to his daughter who feels he should be doing more than resting on his laurels. A seemingly safe experiment with the quantum realm becomes dangerous as a powerful being is out to free himself from the confines of his prison/conquest as Scott, Hope, Hank, and Janet endure dangers in another grand adventure.

This was amazingly hyped by Disney and there are moments when the movie lives up to the hype. But once you actually take the time after watching it you realize that it didn't live up to it. Sadly, this was an average film at best while others would say it is bad. The special effects aren't as convincing as in previous movies, the story and the characters are poorly developed, and while there is some decent acting by a few there are horrendous performances by the rest. I love Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Jonathan Majors delivers as Kang the Conquerer. But Michael Douglas and newcomer Kathryn Newton fare poorly in this film. Many old faces are missed as well as one old face that was most unwelcome. There were some decent surprises but sadly, they do not make this a great movie. It's bad but not so bad that it is completely unwatchable."
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun and exciting movie
"Mar 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely awful! Likely the worst Marvel movie ever made. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer would never save a story this bad."
"Mar 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think this is a very good comic book movie. I love exploring the creatures and different personalities of the quantum realm. In some ways it brought me back to my first watch of Star Wars in that regard. My biggest complaint is it seems like every shot is Infront of a green screen.
"Mar 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was funny and entertaining. Not the best thing I've ever seen, but still worth it to go see it."
"Mar 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was really looking forward to this, as I've really enjoyed the previous Antman movies.  I don't know why Marvel feels the need to diminish characters they've previously established that fans enjoyed by focusing on newer characters we don't know or don't care about.  In this case, this movie should have been titled Daughter of Antman.   Yes, his daughter was important to those previous movies, as Antman's primary motivation, but she wasn't the focus.  Here, she inadvertently becomes the focus.  We have 2 scientific genius's in Michael D's and Michelle P's characters, but it's the daughter of the dummy who's a genius now too?  I want to see a movie about Antman The Wasp, and the new Marvel supervillian, not an ever expanding team with baby antman.   Bill Murray was wasted here, I don't know why he even signed on for this.  Maybe he's running out of money.   As for the new bad guy, it was promising at first, but really piddled out toward the end as someone with a big ego having a tantrum.    You never felt that way about Thanos.   Modok could have been cool, but the CGI face was a bit of a fail.    There was a lot of wasted potential in this movie.  Just too many things going on, that didn't really serve the overall stories focus.    They should have just got out of there by the skin of their teeth, with someone dying to make that possible.  That would have set up the new bad guy as something to fear.  As is, eh."
"Mar 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was awful!! It was so childish and didn't appeal to me at all. Also Hank Pymn took the Lord's name in vain. Very disappointed:(
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Really had a great time watching this movie. Loved all the performances and thought Cassie Lang was a great new addition to the Ant-Man family. Jonathan Majors crushes in the role of Kang.
"Mar 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is not like the other two Ant Man and Wasp movies. It's raised its level of violence and Michael Douglas's character takes the Lord's name in vain in a very vehement way. Any family that is trying to live the good moral life should snub Hollywood on this one, they just went a little too far. I took my 15-year-old grandson and I thought it was too violent for him! There are still humorous moments with Paul Rudd which I liked in the first two, But overall I would say a big ""Yuck""!!!"
"Mar 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's better than most phase 4 movies, but it still doesn't feel as good as the pre-endgame era. Kang was a good villain, but definitely felt a little underpowered in the movie."
"Mar 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,This film missed the mark on several levels. Its greatest sin as an Ant-Man film is that it's too self-serious and not that fun. Its biggest problem is that it's kind of boring despite some of the interesting conceptual elements it has to work with.
"Mar 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely terrible. Feels like what a Fantastic 4 movie should be, but with odd attempts at humor. Majors is great, but not enough of him."
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. Love the storyline and the exploration into the Quantum Realm.
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's surprisingly really good! There were definitely a few times when it didn't quite make sense, or I felt myself asking why they didn't they make the obvious choice, but other than that, it was a great movie. I will def be watching again."
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was amazing. Perfect mix of seriousness, laughs, great plot, great character development, excellent all around. Those hating on this movie might want to rewatch it."
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I did not think it was the best marvel movie I have seen but not even close to the worst, I feel like this movie has been rated lower then it should have been and I blame the  last entries of phase 4 for this I think a percentage of the people that were coming out to see the marvel movies have lost faith in the franchise and antman took the brunt of it.if you go into the movie with an open mind it's pretty good."
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant and the Wasp: Quantumania is a great movie and being the first movie of marvel phase 5 it's intriguing and I love it.
Can't wait to see more of kang"
"Mar 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The first film of Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe follows Scott Lang, Cassie Lang and Hope Van Dyne, along with Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne, who explore the Quantum Realm, where they interact with strange creatures and embark on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they thought was possible, until they have to face Kang The Conqueror. It is an absolutely visually stunning and colorful film, full of creative elements from beginning to end, even if it looks like a Star Wars adventure. The next big villain after Thanos turns out to be quite a thrilling character and I can't wait to see more of him, literally. The humor of this film, however, is a bit dull and the plot has its flaws, not to mention the M.O.D.O.K. character which is just severely underused and ridiculed, to the point it is deemed unnecessary. Also, Michelle Pfeiffer delivers an excellent acting performance as Janet."
"Mar 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Prob was because I wasn‚Äôt paying attention but checked out sooo fast; guess the visuals were good but need to know the story background better to understand the movie? 
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw this in theaters and absolutely LOVED it. This felt like a true Marvel Avengers HERO movie. The cast is amazing. The family dynamics were great, not to mention the stress of protecting others, the ones we love, and the universe as a whole. Great setup after watching the Loki series and to lead the way forward in the Marvel universe."
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"At first I thought it was going to be bad because of all the bad reviews. Its not true at all, The CGI, Acting, Combat, Villain and so many more were amazing and yes it may have a lot of characters and a bit rushed but it worked perfectly. Jonathan Majors as a future starter like for the MCU, He played this role very well even though he got ended off. The MCU would take Kang as a bigger role. Paul and Evangeline were yet the best actors for this movie. everyone was amazing and I look forward to continue to watch Marvel Projects as it goes to Phase 6."
"Mar 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The film is fun and little bit worth to watch, if you search for film that enjoy and good action you can watch this but if you search some good story and plot I don't really recommend and huge plus for Jonathan majors who play Kang really perfect for this role as a kang. About quantum realm yup is really good and the effect is good to.But for the comedy sometimes boring sometimes is make a whole theater laugh"
"Mar 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Awful. Takes place almost completely in dark cavity. Why? Beyond stupid.
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Tipic Marvel and Superhero movie, action, locations, characters are good, visually better than Phase 4 movies. I like it"
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie. Personally liked it better than the second one ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Didn't even realize the 2hrs had passed so quickly üòÖ
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Wasnt expecting as much as most marvel movies and was pleasantly surprised how entertaining it was.
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought that movie was so good and amazing
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,My family and I really enjoyed this film. Paul Rudd is on point. 
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania was so fun! It was cool getting to learn more about Janets time in the quantum realm. I wish the villain and his motives were explained a little more, but hes still the highlight of the movie thanks to Jonathan Majorss performance. Its fun and interesting like the others and I would definitely see it again!"
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic, fun movie. Loved every bit of it. Ignore the critics reviews and listen to the audience. Go, watch and enjoy."
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's really not a bad movie. I don't get all the Marvel hate lately, if you don't like it anymore please just shut up and stop watching them. A lot of the movies in phase 4 weren't the best but that doesn't mean that all of them are bad. I think that people are going into this expecting something else, like an avengers movie or something (which is partially the fault of the trailers), but if you go in expecting an Ant-Man movie, you will have a good time. It's a great Ant-Man movie and Kang is amazing. My only serious issues with the movie are that:
1. It's too short. The movie is only like 2 hours long I think and if it were just 20-30 minutes longer it would feel a lot less rushed toward the end.
2. MODOK. Even still, MODOK is not as bad as people say but he is still terrible. The way he looks is pretty bad, even after the minor changes and his arc in this movie is so insanely bad. They could've done something cool with him but they failed. I just really hope they redo MODOK from another universe or something in Secret Wars but we'll have to wait and see."
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really loved this movie. It had a good villain, humour, twists and suspense, and a very good climatic ending."
"Mar 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If the story and cgi was better. It could have been a great Star Wars movie,"
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Sit back and enjoy! ü§ôüèªüòé
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid flick.  Jonathan Majors is fantastic!
"Mar 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant man? More like Mid man,
Very predictable, some decent jokes, but most fell flat."
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The intricate design of the Quantuam World was amazing and. I loved many of the characters, especially the inclusion of MODOK and Kang the Conquerer was a great super villain to be featured. Ant Man didnt disappoint in the least and I enjoyed the comic tone which was important to give you a giggle in between all the bang bang and sci fi sequences. Paul Rudd was great as was Michelle Pfeifer and Michael Douglass did an admirable job too. All and All I thought Ant Man Quantuam mana was well worth seeing."
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"You have to see this on the big screen!! Especially, if you're an old school Star Wars fan. This is also for Avatar fans, too. This movie has a healthy balance of similarities from those two films, but this still breaks the mold to be it's own film with their fresh new ideas and the many different directions that the story goes. I genuinely and thoroughly enjoyed this film from start to finish, because it was just a really fun story and had everything a film like this really needs to keep you glued to your seat. The real highlight of the film for me was seeing Modok come to life on the silver screen after growing up seeing his unique character in the comics. They stayed super‚Äîtrue to the comics too, I mean, really nailed it as far as I see it. It was an epic experience for me. I mean, seeing M.O.D.O.K. in live action was incredibly nostalgic for me. Even the acting was great, the story was fun, the script was awesome and I can't wait to see more of this from Marvel. They really knocked it out of the park for me on this one. Having Michelle Pfeiffer in the movie was a real twist for me, too. I hadn't really seen her in something since she played Catwoman in the old school Batman film, and it was really good to see her in something as cool as this again. Michael Douglas always delivers, he's definitely one of my all time favorite actors, how could he not be with incredible acting like that? And Paul Rudd is always so animated, too. The other characters were played well and if I said anymore about all of their acting, I'd be here all day reviewing, it was just that good and you have to see it."
"Mar 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ending could've been better
"Mar 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Weak plot, no real point to the film except to promote a continuation of the MCU. Not worth going to anymore....."
"Mar 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Disliked the foul language and the sexual innuendos!  I took my Grandchildren on Spring Break! One was 9 and the other 12 years old! We can have movies without all this!
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked spending time with my grandson
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoy Rudd and Majors and all the rest of the great talent.
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania
We went in not knowing what to expect, and we probably enjoyed it more as a result. It's a fun film; fitting with the tone of the first two.

I have 2 gripes with this film, both cast related. First off, without Michael Pena, this isn't quite as funny. He stole the a lot of the scenes in the first 2 films. Also, I get why they recast the excellent Abby Ryder Fortson for Endgame (the actress would have been too young to play Cassie Lang for the 2023 time frame of Endgame (Emma Fuhrmann, 17 at the time of filming, fit Cassie's MCU age of 16 better,  and actually resembled an older Fortson), so *that recasting* made sense. But in the time-frame of Quantumania (which takes places in 2025) Cassie's supposed to be 18, Furman was 21, but definitely could've played 18. Instead they recast someone even older... Katherine Newton was 25 during shooting, doesn't resemble the other 2 Cassies, nor quite as  good an actress.

Still, tons of action, comedy (that's funny within the context of the situation), and a mysterious backstory (but really only
 mysterious if you haven't been watching the Disney+ MCU shows). It's a joyride, never a dull moment, although sometimes the plot meandered. It was nice that Janet and Hank got a lot more to do this time around.

Modok (scene during the trailers) makes sense within the context of the MCU, Majors is appropriately mancing as Kang. I don't know what's with the low Rotton Tomatoes, I can't wait to see this again. 
A-, 9.1/10

3D: 3D usually doesn't work in dark movies (which was the downfall of both Wakanda Forever & Malificent's 3D), but surprisingly works here... when it matters. Scenes where the 3D wouldn't do much to enhance the experience,  the 3D was practically non-existent. For scenes where it would make a difference, the stereoscopic imagining was pretty good (I noticed only 1 brief scene where the depth frustrums didn't line up creating a double image in the mid background, otherwise it was always clean)

6.5 /10 for the 3D. By comparison Shang Chi's was a 10/10, Wakanda Forever's 3D was a 3/10"
"Mar 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another big letdown since the first movie. The first movie was good. The second, not so good. The third was just bad. It dragged and didn‚Äôt keep my attention. A lot of the scenes and characters looked like a straight copy from Star Wars. I probably won‚Äôt watch the 4th if they decide to come out with another."
"Mar 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not a great story, and effects are clumsy. Did d not enjoy this movie"
"Mar 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"locamente confusa, realmente se siente esta fusi√≥n de antman en el mundo de guardianes de la galaxia ,star wars o todo revuelto al  mismo tiempo algo que a mi criterio funciona muy simplemente ,cgi que en est√©tica y ambientaci√≥n  funciona muy bien  pero un cgi ,dise√±o y desarrollo realmente decepcionante para modok ,una cassie lang muy plana y sin emocion ,una avispa casi perdida en el nombre de la pel√≠cula sin duda lo que levanta el filme a mi parecer es la actuacion de jonathan majors con su personaje de kang , el carisma de paul rudd como scott lang y las poscreditos realmente asombrosas para los fans del ucm ,marvel y los comics."
"Mar 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"To me the.   main characters are entitled, selfish and arrogant the model parents couldn't keep marriage sacred, because of needs, what else could you expect from a thieving granddaughter and a lying father because the have needs too, the one true character was the villain and towards the end I was rooting for him stupid ants mess it all up. I have  seen all the movies, the heroes are still the same people just older. No moral growth they can't even be dissent people."
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Its just an incre√≠ble movie after all. Marvel had a successful opening
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining and very fast paced.
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,My kids and I loved this movie! Definitely a great movie to watch with the whole family.
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great! Fun, silly, weird, self-deprecating and did not take itself too seriously.

Critics are wrong (and take themselves very seriously)."
"Mar 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"N√£o √© ruim, mas tamb√©m n√£o √© bom... nem fede, nem cheira."
"Mar 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathon Majors killed it as Kang, and the pacing was rock solid‚Ä¶ just not the bang to kick off phase 5 that I wanted. Even so, still the best thing to come out of Marvel since Endgame that's not named Spiderman"
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was your typical Marvel movie but the Ant-Man story didn't play out as interestingly as any of the other Marvel characters, it was kind of dry."
"Mar 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie took a pretty obvious approach. Find a problem to make the characters struggle and how do they work their way out of it. The start to the point was quick, long middle, and ending it as fast as it started. Few good jokes along the way to help keep a pace that wasn‚Äôt overly dragging. I recommend to wait for the DVD/stream."
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie was far superior the Antman and the wasp. The stakes felt higher and the universe wider.  Maybe on par with Antman 1 however Kang could've be3n given more screen time
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked Kang's character and Michelle Pheiffer's character. The message of the movie was uplifting as well. While it could have been better (adding the previous supporting cast of characters and Michelle Pheiffer's forgotten powers from the second film), it was a pleasant romp."
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant man and the wasp quantuminia movie is better than ant man 1,2 because this movie ant man facing Kang he is a powerful villan next Avengers Kang dastiney main villan.but some mistake there in. Store that's all thank you."
"Mar 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Johnathan Major's performance may be a sight to see however Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania lacks the sense of fun the previous two had that made them exciting to watch.
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very family friendly.
"Mar 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible movie wth has happened to marvel
"Mar 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Overhated in my opinion. Antman is better than LaT. Good introducion to Kang The Conqueror. I really would like to see this Kang in Kang Dynasty as The Beyonder. This will be peak!
"Mar 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Guess I'm just not that interested in quantumania... or the uninspiring plot... or the plug for socialism.  Thumbs down for Marvel again
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um filme muito bom, mas com algumas cenas muito parvas e desinteressantes, n√£o compreendo as notas dos cr√≠ticos."
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it, Kang will be huge"

"Mar 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It is not the deepest story of the MCU franchise films but it was entertaining and it is the start of Kang the Conqueror story so there's something to look forward to. I wish the MCU films would not lump so much into one film as it distracts from the main story. MCU is so busy now introducing new hero's that they forget to close out the original MCU Hero's story properly. Doctor strange had to much Wanda going on while introducing AmErica that it took away from Strange Story arc. Thor did the same. Spidey was just a mess that wanted to get Parker out of the MCU in case Sony took their ball and left. So hopefully we get much more deeper stories dealing with the title characters not role players distracting the story.
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was immersive and Rudd, Majors and Pfeiffer were great.  Not without its flaws but I left the movie theater entertained and glad that I saw it.  I can't always say that about some of the recent Marvel films.  This movie, like how I felt about Eternals as well, are examples where I disagree with the critics a lot.  Excited for the future of Marvel again.  (PS, hey Feige, get Quake back in the mix and I'll be through the moon excited)"
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie idk wht all the hate is about
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a very ideal way to start Marvel Phase 5. The action was nothing special, but it wasn't boring. William Jackson Harper played an almost dismissible supporting role that would've probably been overlooked, but he played the role with great humor that reminds you of his character on The Good Place. Jonathan Majors stole the show as the main antagonist. Her was phenomenal as Kang, probably one of the top three best Marvel villains so far. On the downside, Bill Murray's character was completely wasted, and there is a certain dialogue between Cassie and MODOK towards the climax that is literally cringe-inducing. The attempt at humor and heartfelt lessons in the scene are pushed way too hard and the ""punchline"" is just so cringey, if I was streaming the movie, I would skip the whole scene just to never see it again. I give this film a solid 85%, (minus the cringe scene it's like a 90%)"
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love Ant-Man always. Seemed kinda like they went to Star Wars, but crazy plot twist after the credits."
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The special effects were awesome overall that took time to make the film and it is good to see with the family but children must 13 years and older.
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Most viewers here rate by their own experiences, I'm quite a big marvel fan when it comes to theaters (I don't know comics). Coming from me the movie was great. Kang was a great villain and this Kang shows us how big ""Avengers Kang's dynasty"" can really be. The plot was okay as It's an ant man movie but ant man did not play a big part when it comes to decision making [SPOILERS] as the whole reason he helps Kang is because he has no choice. Definitely good on the actions but the ending could have been left hanging. The end will be much better if he was stranded with the wasp in the quantum realm to be rescued in other marvel movies in the future. The CGI is as always questionable but it was worth seeing in theaters 8/10. ps :End credit is also awesome If you watched loki it hypes you up for the second season"
"Mar 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining,  humorous."
"Mar 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You would think that Marvel learned the lesson after the phase 4 fiasco, but no.
Still predictable heroes and villains. The only good thing in this film is the post credits scenes."
"Mar 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel needs to fix there CGI real quick. It‚Äôs just getting worse and worse. M.O.D.O.K was so laughable looking. Legit every time he showed his face the theater would laugh at it. Kang was cool. Paul Rudd and crew were good. Story was ok. Pretty funny. Great surprise cameo
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"If youre a true marvel fan, dont miss this one. Really kicks off the dynasty"
"Mar 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"En realidad la pel√≠cula como tal no es mala, considerando productos entregados previamente por la empresa encargada, el problema en si es que es un trailer de 2 horas, se guarda a los personajes para sacarlos dentro de 3 a 5 a√±os para un ""evento"", pero si yo quiero ver una pel√≠cula, quiero ver una pel√≠cula no un trailer de 2 horas, pero repito tan mala como se a llegado a decir tampoco. 
Sigue siendo una pel√≠cula de superh√©roes y eso nos dieron, mal hecha pero no le quita que sea una pel√≠cula de superh√©roes."
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Was good lots of action but definitely weird. Reminded me of star wars with the weird characters
"Mar 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Everything that was great about Ant-man was not in this movie. All the fun, lighthearted jokes completely eradicated from this movie."
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Anything Marvel is a watch loved it
"Mar 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was alright, at points it felt like a rip off of Star Wars and Godzilla and most of the jokes didn't land but the CGI was decent and the character didn't suck. Kang was pretty much the what thing of the movie.

I don't entirely recommend it but if you have time it's something to consider."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Original Cassie Actress would have much better. Negative for casting choice.
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,AWESOME ! LOVED IT ! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT üëçüëç
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie and food was very good, I will definitely come back to Cinebistro"
"Mar 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,This film is equal parts unique and clich√© as a stand-alone. I get the sense that its main purpose was to establish the next few films and shows of the MCU.
"Mar 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is not as bad as most people say it is. Is some of the charm of the first two films in the series lost? Yes. Is it the weirdest MCU movie(more weird than the Doctor Strange films) to date? Yes. However, this movie is worth the watch, especially because of Jonathan Majors's performance as Kang the Conqueror."
"Mar 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania was a movie that had some flaws. The story wasn't so bad but was mare with illogical tropes and decision. Like the one of the mother never talking about the realm or Kang. that makes no sens. And suddenly, you can breath in that realm. Murray is a glorified cameo. The acting is unequal. The best one is Kang actor and by far. Mordok was just poor, in terms of the who, the how. The humour is almost absent. I missed Luis and his gang. The CGI is nice, but of course, it's done in a dark setting from beginning to end. Better rendering time I guess, but it didn't help to clarify the scenes and the actions. The music is good, and the sounds really decent. I give it 62%. A CGI fest with a lot of holes in the story. For me the weakest of the Ant-man."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's Marvel. it was great.
"Mar 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It really sucks that you can't take villains seriously anymore.
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Paul Rudd was his normal funny self.  The rest of the cast was very good as well.  Fun entertainment.  Not Marvels best but worth seeing.
"Mar 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was interrupted by a light being on, an alarm was going on. A group of adults with kids. Adults taking pictures with their flash on. The the adults were worse than the kids with the phone flash light on. Worse experience ever."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked the movie, although it‚Äôs not a movie I would pick my self my grandson. Wanted to see it. It was a little long. But otherwise good. Great sound effects."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Very interesting i will definitely watch again
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Hopefully there is a sequel to it since they were talking about the multiverse.
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania is a relief after phase 4 and a great kick off for phase 5. Functioning as a typical Marvel movie set in this new environment with lots of strongly varying characters and one of the best villains the MCU has introduced so far.

Kang the Conqueror shows the power and potential that this new big-bad has for the Multiverse saga. Jonathan Majors delivers a villain like no other in the MCU and steals the show. The world this movie is set in is designed great and the CGI is back on the level it should be.

Although the storyline is predictable and doesn't dive deep into our characters the way a 3rd act should, this movie is still a fun Ant-man (and less the Wasp) ride through a new world full of crazy happenings. This last movie of a trilogy is more about setting up new storylines and a new villain. Because of that the characters we know get less character development and poor dialogue, as a result, the movie misses emotion and sacrifice. The debut of the long awaited M.O.D.O.K. is debatable but works due to its crazy comics core and adaption to the MCU's storyline.

It's worth watching both for the bigger Marvel fans as new fans who are ready for more to come. So see it for yourself before you listen to the critics."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the triple story line with mom, dad and Cage"
"Mar 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Able to see superb acting from Johnathan majors other than that film having bad plot , no character development for any character, having cheap jokes and wasted M.O.D.OK ."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"majors is a addition the universe, and so great at adapting to the different versions of his character. was great story telling in my opinion for the entire movie and what's to come."
"Mar 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A lot was going on, but this was an overall fun superhero movie. Sequels are never as good as the first, yet this one still worked on its own."
"Mar 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,The CGI was fun and the movie didn't lag too much but it lacked a lot of the fun from the first two movies. I'm still a sucker for the MCU movies - I'm too vested to give up on them and this had enough to keep me going for another round.
"Mar 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another disappointment from Marvel. The buildup of the story took at least half the time before jumping into action. The CGI was good one way or the other(Except the MODOK), however they failed to explain the chemistry the hero had with his daughter and his love interest. Overall, I think its not worth going unless if there is a flash sale for the movie tickets, or if you have a lot of time to kill. Though they clearly did a good job with making this movie entertaining for kids of 7 years. Great start to phase 5 of Marvel."
"Mar 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Went for Jonathan Majors, got Jonathan Minor‚Ä¶ Should have left Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) as the comedic Avenger movies, not Thor‚Ä¶"
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very fun and visually stunning journey through the quantum realm. A great cast and really good acting, really awesome fight scenes, and definitely gives Star Wars vibes, but not because it‚Äôs copying, simply, because you have rebellions, exploring universes and traveling through worlds and aliens, so yeah, if you like that, then you‚Äôll definitely love this movie. some good jokes mixed in, it is missing some music and may be a little bit of a personal touch but it‚Äôs really a great movie and definitely one of my favorite, recent marvel movies. Go and see it! Don‚Äôt just listen to all the haters, see it for yourself, and you will have a good time."
"Mar 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Sorry marvel too much marvel fatigue with this one‚Ä¶. You had such a great opportunity to make this the kick off to phase 5 but it fell flat it sucks because I really like the ant man character and the movies before
"Mar 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I very rarely walk out on films but I just had to on this one.  The New Ant-Man only brings one to a place of more disappointment with Marvel dribble that just keeps getting worse....and they used to be great!  Why the Quantum realm has to look like a Dali-esque acid trip, with goo creatures that shoot 350 mm magnum bullets, with entire communities living as a collective of creatures you may expect to see in a Star Wars bar-fight scene, is completely beyond me.  Movie made absolutely no sense whatsoever other than to continue a Marvel storyline and franchise now desperate for good writers."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was great! Full of action, heartwarming and funny. 
Love michael douglas and Michelle Pfeiher in it"
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. The story made senses, funny but not cheesy. Jonathan Majors stole the show."
"Mar 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite all the comments from others I enjoyed the film.  There were laughs, good action scenes, the story was decent.  Sure it doesn't match the original in Marvel, and people can argue over certain things.  But it's a movie and it did what it's supposed to entertain.  I mean look at the overall audience score of 83%.  Critics rate it around what 40%.  This is just another sign of critics having NO idea what the public wants for entertainment and live in a little elitist bubble.  You can't trust their reviews, ever, anymore.  The age of the good reviews of Sisko and Ebert are gone and all that is left is .. snobs .. for lack of a better word."
"Mar 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think that Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantunmania is a incomplete movie that fails in some aspects but the quantum world is amazaing is a mix of Marvel with Star Wars, Paul Rude is funny and cheerful but Jonathan Majors stoles the movie like Kang and the 2 post credit scene was like KA-BOOM, but the problem with this movie is that this is a story with a lot of problems but is okay for me. 7/10"
"Mar 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was excited to watch,but it failed to impress. Writing was every where and plot was not Ant-Man & Ant-Man and The Wasp writing. Tried too hard to be funny in a somewhat serious situation and failed miserably and vice versa"
"Mar 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang is the standout of this movie! But Modok‚Äôs face looks goofy ahh
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very funny, lots of action. Worth going to see."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Good action and fun script.
"Mar 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The villain is good if not great.  The rest of it is interesting enough, but the humor elements seemed flat and the story just doesn't offer the degree of threat expected.  Overall, if you are following the Marvel Universe, then this movie is an acceptable watch, but felt like one time was good enough.  My 11-year old son slept through most of it because he felt it was slow and he lost interest, but he did like the laser head dude."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I‚Äôm not sure what movie the critics saw, or why they‚Äôre trying to kill this movie, but it was a great movie."
"Mar 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It as good as the last one. Still decent
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the 31st feature film produced by Marvel Studios and marks the official start of phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As a fan of both Paul Rudd and the MCU, I was excited to see what the film had to offer. The movie features an impressive ensemble cast, including Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Micheal Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jonathan Majors, and Kathlyn Newton. It is directed by Peyton Reed, who previously helmed the previous two Antman films. And written by Jeff Loveness, best known for his work on ""The Office"" and ""Rick and Morty.""

The story follows the exploits of Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne, played by Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, respectively, as they take on their roles as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Along with their allies Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne, portrayed by Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer, they embark on a journey into the Quantum Realm. The team, including newcomer Kathlyn Newton as Cassie Lang, Scott's daughter, encounters strange and enigmatic creatures as they journey work to find their way back home.

Despite the impressive cast and exciting premise, the film suffered from a convoluted plot, underdeveloped characters, and subpar CGI moments. As a fan, I was left disappointed as the film felt like filler content for the MCU, with a story that primarily connected various future projects.

However, Jonathan Majors' portrayal of the multiversal villain Kang was a standout, bringing gravitas and complexity to the role. His performance alone was a bright spot in an otherwise lackluster film.

In conclusion, ""Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is not the strongest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Still, fans of the franchise will likely appreciate the humor, impressive visuals, and various connections to the larger universe. Despite the film's flaws, I remain hopeful for the future of the MCU and look forward to seeing how upcoming projects will continue to expand the universe."
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good father Scott :)
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great for the kids the flow was confusing for us adults.
"Mar 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall, I enjoyed the film. The story wasn‚Äôt anything special, but It had some cool action sequences. Kang was the best part of the film. Looking forward to seeing him in future MCU projects."
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it. 
Firstly the acting by Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly and Kathryn is wonderful.  Michelle Pfeifer and Michael Douglas are great as usual.
Jonathan as Kang only grows better and better.

The story line and characterisations were wonderful and the scenery breathtaking. 

I don't understand the critics reaction. To me this was fun."
"Mar 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Para mi gusto es buena, mas pens√°ndolo bien atman no poderia ganarle al conquistador fartou un poco de realismo, luego lo dem√°s me gusto, tambi√©n le farto m√°s pelea e participaci√≥n de atman."
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantumania was AWESOME. But it's funny because it feels like a star wars picture.
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not the best, far from the worse. A little slow at first, but gets pretty good as it progresses"
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Comedy and a lot of action. My son and I loved it.
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The entire family enjoyed it (me, my wife, 2 daughters). Our oldest daughter (12yo) said it was one of her favorite Marvel movies yet.

My biggest criticism of recent Marvel movies is the overuse of digital sets. The character CGI is excellent, but the sets and lighting are so obviously fake that it becomes a distraction."
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,wonderful storytelling once again! great movie to watch with the family and works particularly well for some father-daughter time. my daughter and I loved it! definitely recommend!
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was supposed to be a film about Kang - the conqueror not Kang - you are wasting my time. come on man. just because its a marvel movie , doesn't mean it has to be all about CGI and visual effects. there is barely any story at all. just the performance of the cast. there wasn't even a strong motive for this story."
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,the ending was horrible. i was not a fan of the movie overall
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie with some laughs too.
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was way better then the second one. The second one had horrible dialogue in it. Critics never have a clue what movies are good. Why they get paid it's beyond me but it seems like every time that I like a movie the critics didn't like it. Case in point avatar The Way of the water was horrible in my opinion
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible, one of the worst marvel movies of all time ,TOP 5"
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie.  I hope I e it continues so I can find out what happens next.
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it the movie was very engaging
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Two hours of my life I won't get back. It appears Marvel are more concerned over quantity than quality nowadays. The Humpty Dumpty character was absolutely laughable.
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,this was good movie as a beginning and first movie of new phase 5 and mid credit scene was mind blowing and important specially end post credit scene was an unexpected surprise.
"Mar 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was at least better then wakanda fornever
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Love this movie I think it was an amazing introduction to kang and to his capabilities. The only thing I would have changed was to make it more violent honestly I wish kang just went absolutely ballistic because in the beginning they talk about his temper and his tantrums so I wish we could see on a larger scale his capabilities. Ant-man and kang absolutely carried the movie and 100% got me ready for the next one.
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I liked kangs actor. But come on, he was ultimately beaten by ants. And Hank said gd. Not cool"
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"MCU writing has fallen way off. Don't expect a deep movie, but too many inconsistencies, even for sci-fi. Yawner as well."
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it MODOK was hilarious! 
It has Ant's, Man!"
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was exciting but there was overused language. The worst was the very slow and loud GD cussword in the middle of the film. It broke my heart.
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Definitely one of the worst films I‚Äôve ever seen in a theater. 
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bad Writing and bad Visuals just a really Bad made movie like most mcu movies these days
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I could only endure 45 minutes of suffering through this movie.  It was so boring.  There was nothing to enjoy about this movie.
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the nonstop action pack movie.
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring,i fell asleep at the cinema"
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it - fun movies cant wait for the next Marvel movie!
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was pretty good! Even after watching it still leaves my mind open with questions and is keeping me on my toes for more. I know with other movies and shows coming up it i want to see how everything ties up together.
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good edition to the marvel universe. no dislikes
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lack luster. Boring. Nobody in the film wants to be there, they know it's bad and the marvel writers have no talent. They're just handing iut writing jobs to anyone huh ?"
"Mar 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"La pel√≠cula carece de gui√≥n y es descuidado, personajes feos y ni se diga de M.O.D.O.K. Y para ser la primera pel√≠cula de la fase 5 de Marvel es atroz. La Vi y me entretuvo pero no la ver√≠a una segunda vez y si algo a demostrado la saga de ant man es que sin Michael pe√±a siendo de Luis con sus chistes la saga no ser√° la misma. Lo √∫nico bueno de la pel√≠cula es KANG!"
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,creo que fue bastante aburrida
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,me encanto mucho esto es extraordinatio. movie full god
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics get paid.  Movies get made.  This one had its moments of bliss.  That's why we go to the movies.  Thank you to the Ant-Man teams!
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Mediocre. Im personally losing interest.I can't see these next phase is being spectacular
"Mar 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Majors arrebenta na atua√ß√£o, fazendo de cenas que eram para ser qualquer coisa serem mais interessantes. Paul Rudd carism√°tico como sempre, mas o filme acaba do mesmo jeito que come√ßa. A diferen√ßa √© que Scott passou a saber da exist√™ncia de Kang e Cassie passou a admirar seu pai. Como n√£o esperava nada desse filme, n√£o me decepcionou tanto."
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is very good movie everyone to see this and share to everyone to see this amazing movie
"Mar 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Is it unrealistic expectations or is it Marvel Movie Fatigue? I actually re-read my previous reviews for both the last Marvel movie and the last Ant-Man one and I realized the things I said before on both those films apply equally to this one. So I don't understand the hate and/or disappointment here when, at least by my account, this really is no better or worse than before? The problem perhaps is that this film is noticeably more CGI/green screen and exposition heavy and it's getting tired and formulaic, lacking the gracefulness or sophistication some other Marvel/superhero films have that allow them to get away with it. The Ant-Man series has always been more family adventure comedy, with the emphasis on comedy, and it has also been the inconsequential and insubstantial little brother to the other Marvel sub-franchises used mainly to introduce new elements to the overall MCU that will be fully explored in other films. Peyton Reed's loud and messy third outing is no different in this respect, as he decides to swing big and embarks on a world-building exercise by sending the Ant-Man family into the Quantum Realm. However, this ends up resembling a Star Wars cosplay convention with creatures that lean very much into the cuddly and silly. Bar some minor clever moments (the communication resolution; some surrealist visuals) and the introduction of a surprising new/old character, the safe plotting lacks edginess or real jeopardy, and much of this won't make a lick of sense in the cold light of day. However, the 2hrs+ running time wooshed by swiftly enough, the comedic moments mostly land, Jonathan Majors' scene-chewing Kang has presence (and promise for future films), and anything that has Michael Douglas having this much fun and Michelle Pfeiffer kicking ass is ultimately fine by me."
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was everything you hated from modern Disney movies all wrapped into one. The movie managed to do a few things right thankfully. Antman's ark feels completed and Paul Rudd's performance was as good as always. Jonathan Major's performance as Kang was easily one of the best in the MCU. Some of the side characters were funny and not overly obnoxious. That is about it. To enjoy the movie you need to believe that Janet Van Dyne, a previous super hero and genius, was either too scared or stupid to alert the world of the guy trying to conquer LITERALLY EVERYTHING. The story writing overall was terrible. Somehow the writers took a character that like Kang and make him feel lame. Kang is supposed to be all powerful, and gets beat my ants. I know its ""Antman"" but come on. The entire Quantum Realm felt like a Star Wars world rip-off, and most side characters were awful. Unfortunately this movie proves that Disney does not care about the movies they produce. Why spend time and money developing a great story and script when if you make funny jokes and swear a few times the movie will make millions."
"Mar 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good at the beginning, then the film lost its own things. So bad for the trilogy"
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The entire movie is in CGI, Disappointed."
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"disappointed... antman is supposed to be more of a fun movie... but this one makes it a hero movie which shows weakness in the whole concept of antman; the discrepency and inconsistancy of antman power...  supposedly antman can be very powerful when expanding to giant size however the character rarely uses it ...and when it does it, it uses it at the most inappropriate times...

the movie tries to remedy the inconsistancies but that only results in inconsistancies across the board for ALL characters, heros, and vallians as far as their power and abilities."
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not horrible like Love and Thunder but just painfully average in every department. Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer are the only ones who actually elevate the film."
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme ruim, t√£o ruim que doi, transformaram o Kang em um ser fraco que perde pros coadjuvante personangens do UMC, filme pastel√£o mesmo, queria meu dinheiro de volta"
"Mar 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant Man has a great heart and good characters we genuinely care about.  We have definitely done this sing and dance before but with the introduction of Kang, makes this intriguing nonetheless‚Ä¶"
"Mar 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,not as fun and into it as the first 2. Majors shows versatility in craft tho. nice one
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am partial to the Ant-Man/Wasp franchise both for its light-hearted/none-too-serious approach to things and Evangeline Lilly starring, so it comes as no surprise that I think this is one of the better MCU films of late. The story seems convoluted and leaves many open questions, but the visuals more than make up for that. Think Avatar meets Star Wars in a dark environment without sky: fantastic world building both in creatures and technology paired with epic infantry style battles. Good popcorn entertainment, of course hinting at further sequels in the after credit bits."
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,O filme √© bem legal! Mas a marvel precisa seguir um caminho mais maduro
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Did not like the story at all. The first two movies were good but this one sucked. Sorry.
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The ending was awesome can‚Äôt wait to see the next sequel!
"Mar 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel Movie Since EndGame Aside from the Sony Produced ones but at least Disney/Marvel is focusing less on politics to push their movies again I recommend it because of Jonathon Majors And Paul Rudd
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,The film has a very unfocused plot with no real dramatic story beats. It's a point A to B film with a weird sprinkle of Kang's introduction to the MCU with a really un even power dynamic of Kang's ability which was confusing. Some very odd choices when it comes to the CGI and choices of characters ie MODOK.
"Mar 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,I guess it's ok because I like all the actors but it is just one long CG extravaganza with most of the effects serving no real purpose.
"Mar 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun but disappointing
"Mar 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Primero Para Los Que No Me Conocen Dejenme Presentarme Soy Alejandro Murillo Soy De Panam√° Y Soy Un Critico Muy Especializado O Sea Que Prometere Ser El Maximo Critico Por Encima De To' Los Criticos A Nivel Mundial En Cuanto A Criticar Producciones Se Trata Y Por √öltimo Voy A Ver Que Pel√≠cula O Serie Me Gusta Y Que No. En Fin (Est√° Es Mi Primera Critica Por Cierto) Me Gust√≥ Un Poquito Quantumania Porque Hay Escenas Graciosas Como En La Primera Pel√≠cula, Pero El Resto Es Horrible Como The Wasp Y El CGI Que Fue LO PEOR. A Est√° Pel√≠cula Le Doy 3/5. Total Asco."
"Mar 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It must be difficult as an actor to play against a green screen for an entire movie. Thats pretty much this third Ant-Man film. I do like Paul Rudd and I liked the relationship that has developed between Scott and his daughter, Cassie. But as for character development, thats about as far as it goes. The other main characters were largely the same and the new characters didnt have any back story that made you care too much about their fate. Apparently, Kang will be backbut I probably wont be there to see it."
"Mar 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Overall, a let down. I expected a lot from the movie, especially if they're gonna bring the Kang the Conqueror."
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Oh man this movie is overhated by the critics, the fans. Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror proved that he can easily beat iconic Marvel villains like Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus and Josh Brolin's Thanos, in my opinion the best villain portrayal in cinema! Newcomer Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang does an oustanding job too! It's good to see Scott, Hope, Hank and Janet again in this action-packed, visually stunning movie that gets snowed under by theaters unjustly only for the sake of playing Avatar: The Way Of Water!"
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"A good stand-alone movie that was only enhanced with the prior viewings and knowledge of Ant-Man, Ant-Man & The Wasp, and Avengers: End Game.

Michael Douglas & Michelle Pfeifer as Hank Pym & Janet Van Dyne were respectable, stoic and even funny at times.  Paul Rudd as Scott Lang stole the show as usual and will have you rolling.  Evangeline Lilly as Hope was great support and will have you cheering her on.  And the casting of Cassie Lang was spot on as she looks just like a grown up Cassie from the initial Ant-Man movie. 

The MODOK character will take some time to grow on you, but will leave you wanting more by the end.  And although Kang's character will seem underwhelming with so much potential, all can be forgiven if understood that this is just a Kang VARIANT and most likely not KANG the CONQUERER as portrayed in the comics.  Once the viewer realizes that this KANG was perhaps the Multiverse's best hope at challenging the Kang threat to come, then the plot begins to solidify into a firm foundation of what's to come in future MCU movies.

Overall, this was a far better movie than the critics give it credit for.  It had it's serious tones when it needed and it had it's mystery that even had die hard MCU enthusiasts questioning themselves.  But most importantly, it had it's awesome action and fight scenes.  It had it's edge-of-your seat reveals and it had it's timely and spot on humor.   This Ant-Man movie is a must-see and probably places as 2nd best of the 3 behind the initial one in terms of quality and overall production."
"Mar 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Spoiler free

If you're a casual fan looking for the thrills and charm of classic mcu films like ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers "" then you will certainly find this installment lackluster. 
Though this movie has the comedic relief thanks to Paul Rudd, there is very little that keeps casual (non-comic reading) fans entertained. 
With this said, Jonathan Majors' role as Kang the Conqueror was extremely well done, and many fans will certainly look forward to more appearances by him. 
The main issue that kept this movie from the ranks of classic marvel films is the fact that the stakes are (pun intended) sub-atomic. We as the audience are expected to feel suspense and nervousness to characters with very little depth and background, and this leads to complacency and indifference. With other installments like ""infinity war"" and ""endgame "" we fear for our humanity and our earth. Heroes that we have grown to love face peril and certain doom. ""Quantumania"", on the other hand, gives us 2-dimensional heroes that fight to save an alternate world.
All in all, I have skepticisms of the direction the mcu is going, and feel that the multiversal themes we are seeing will lead to the death of the mcu's familiarity and charm. If you want to keep track of the mcu and be informed on the canon, go ahead, watch this movie! But if you want to enjoy a entertaining marvel flick, popcorn in hand, you're much better off with the oldies."
"Mar 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Oof marvel has fallen off the cliff...the writing for this was atrocious
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an amazing movie to kick off the MCU Phase 5 Jonathan Majors stole the movie for me Kang the Conqueror is the best villain. But MODOK was kinda done dirty in this film he was hilarious but he didn‚Äôt really have a purpose and also didn‚Äôt have a story arc. Katherine Newton also stole the movie for me. Katherine Newton was amazing as Cassie Lang and I hope we see her in more MCU projects. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily were incredible I love them. The visuals were amazing in the Quantum Realm and this film easily sets up Avengers: The Kang Dynasty even the post credits scenes especially the first one Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was a really great film I really enjoyed it ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING SPOILER AHEAD ‚ö†Ô∏è. the first post credit scene features the Council of Kangs in an arena assembling for the multiversal war (Secret Wars) and Immortus,Rama-Tut, and Scarlet Centurion shows up and talking about the Kang variant they banished that was in Quantumania ‚Äúdied‚Äù"
"Mar 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another pretty boring Marvel movie. It goes through the motions and does little to make the movie interesting. Kang is lame and they make MODOK a bit of a gag character - way to alienate long time readers and maybe even those just being introduced to these characters. Please, don't make mine Marvel anymore."
"Mar 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not as bad as the critics. CGI is debatable but plot is solid.
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was pretty bored with the last couple Marvel installments but I felt this movie brought back some of the magic. Basically, if you like Marvel movies you'll like this movie too."
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una buena pel√≠cula para pasar el rato, la m√°s madura de la trilog√≠a y con varias conexiones al futuro. Los que la punt√∫an mal es porque no tienen idea del todo cohesionado que es Marvel"
"Mar 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Yeah this movie was not fun , i like kang."
"Mar 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was kind of boring...not my type of movie.
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,movie was great people need to be fair when judging.
"Mar 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not funny, storyline just boring!"
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,A Great movie for only one reason - it indirectly conveys the great Secret. Knowing this Secret is inevitable to escape time/ earth. But unfortunately only few can understand the hidden message conveyed!!!
"Mar 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Incredibly silly and foolish üò©
At times painful to watch.
Worst Marvel movie ever üòÜ"
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed it very much it was a fun popcorn movie. It was great to see more of the quantu realm aka the microverse. Jonathan Majors did a great job as one of the Avengers great villians look foward to seeing him again. As a comic fan for over 20 yrs it was a blast
"Mar 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The bar fall franchise is definitely going downhill. From Thors last movie and now Ant-man and the wasp, quantum mania? Kevin really needs to get His act together. Hes definitely losing his touch. And, Disney is not helping."
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,good loved it very much
"Mar 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wasn't interested in the movie but I like Paul Rudd so i gave him an opportunity. Paul Rudd has to carry the movie on his shoulders alone. Michael Douglas and Michell Pfeifer there were good also as supporting characters. Weak villain, I guess I am used to Thanos who was bigger than life. Not interested in Marvel movies anymore. 
Anyway Marvel died with End Game."
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it better than the first two. It had portions that were other worldly like Avatar.
"Mar 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Sets up a lot to come. Some fun moments. Still, a marvel movie, so of course it was decent. "
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this was a great movie.  It was as intense and taut as Avengers Infinity Wars and Endgame.  There weren't a lot of gags but it made sense as there was a seriousness and desperation to the characters and plot.  The special effects and CGI were great and they took their time with the fights scenes so you could tell what was actually happening (not as much jump-cut editing).  I have a theory about the bad reviews it was getting... If you weren't familiar with the character of Kang in Marvel or didn't know much about the Quantum realm, you would probably watch the film and have no idea of what was happening. ""Where is this place and how did all these odd characters get here?"" Or ""So Kang gets to come to our universe... big deal. Whoever is left of the Avengers will take him down"".  If you know some of the background and storylines of the film, you will be immersed immediately and get hooked. 

Anyway, I thought the film was excellent and I was marking out more than I have for any of the other recent Marvel films."
"Mar 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible movie. Bad writing, bad story and some good characters had bad lines. The only good thing about this movie is kang."
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was fun. I don't understand all the hate. It was one of the best of the new phase so far.
"Mar 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrble, too loud, no story line, thought Michelle Pheiffer & MIke Douglas were high caliber of actors and would never have associated with this ridiculous junk."
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it.  A great kick off to the next phase of the MCU.  Paul Rudd is just magic!
"Mar 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"In Marvel Studios' ‚ÄòAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', our favorite pint-sized (and occasionally giant-sized) hero Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and co. are sucked into, and subsequently trapped in, the otherworldly Quantum Realm. There, Scott is forced to make a deal with the Devil, or in this case the dictatorial Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), the only one with the means to get them home. As the title suggests, the majority of the movie takes place in this subatomic universe, which doesn't look half-bad, considering it's basically a fully-CG environment. It is home to some unique creatures and residents, who have fairly minimal roles and are ultimately kinda forgettable, though the one named Veb was hilarious. The movie wastes no time getting the plot in motion, as we're off into the Quantum Realm within the first 10 minutes, and it's pretty well-paced overall. As far as the cast, everyone does a solid job. Paul Rudd is delightful as usual, and Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne gets some time to shine in a larger role than expected. Newcomer Kathryn Newton portrays Scott's now-teenaged daughter Cassie, and while it was cool seeing her suit-up alongside her dad, she comes off as a bit unbelievable at times. However, it's Jonathan Majors' Kang who steals the show. He's menacing, intimidating, and has a calm-yet-confident demeanor. I've always loved characters who know how much of a threat they are, like Darth Vader, and Kang definitely fits into that category. I truly cannot wait to see more of him in future MCU projects. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention MODOK, the most perfectly goofy and ridiculous character I've ever had the pleasure of meeting in a movie. Overall, ‚ÄòQuantumania' is much bigger in scale than the previous films in the ‚ÄòAnt-Man' series, but still retains most of the humor and heart that they've become known for. In fact, I personally like it better than the last installment, ‚ÄòAnt-Man and the Wasp'. It's a fun, extremely comic book-y (in a good way) family adventure through an intriguing sci-fi world, and I definitely had a good time watching."
"Mar 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Great villain. Some nice quotes but, in terms of plot and main development of the main character, something is missing."
"Mar 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Standard film, nothing too great"
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel comics fan‚Ä¶ Presented very much like a comic, to me. I was entertained!"
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Hat mir gut gefallen
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good marvel movie!
"Mar 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was a blast. It reminded me of the OG star wars trilogy. Seeing a bunch of weird aliens and rebels fighting against a dictatorship. Kang was awesome. He is definitely gonna be an awesome villain in the upcoming phases. Paul Rudd was great as always. I just wish it was longer. There needed to be more time fleshing out Cassie's teenage years how how Scott Lang deals with that to nail home the theme of the movie. Overall, such a fun time at the theaters'."
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun one!

I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.

Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.

Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M.O.D.O.K. is a lot of fun.

Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking."
"Mar 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great effects.  Jonathon majors was excellent!
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another typical Marvel movie. Enjoyed it, but it wasn't like Black Panther or Iron Man (which are the two movies I always compare Marvel movies to)."
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked all the new characters, story line tie into everything really well.  Great movie as always!!"
"Mar 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Everything you loved about Ant-Man movies is not present in here for the most part. While it has glimmers of comedic charm, and a wonderful Michelle Pfeiffer, not even a fantastic performance from Jonathan Majors can save this dull installment within this franchise. Goodbye to the small scale fun heist thrillers, this film tries to go bigger and suffer from sequelitis."
"Mar 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was good, the movie was fun to talk about afterwards with the people I went with, great ending but was a little too open ended for me."
"Mar 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another Meh Marvel film. I think I fell asleep during this one. Marvel continues its streak of mediocrity since Endgame. Then again, how do you top Endgame? It's a shame Disney doesn't know how to end it on a high note."
"Mar 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Should of just done movie night at home. My soround sound system is much louder than the 7.1 sound they have. Was very disappointing paying cinema prices w/out the cinema experience. S**t's weak!!!
"Mar 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Enjoyable for my grandchildren who are out on spring break! A good time was had by all :)
"Mar 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,ok movie. not great. slow at beginning but builds up nicely. the bad guy was cool.
"Mar 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A little slow in the beginning,  a little predictable, however the ending is quite good."
"Mar 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good story. Liked the new family dynamic of Scott and Cassie with the Pyms.
"Mar 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"My most anticipated marvel movie since spider-man no way home, VFX were great, but unfortunately the plot had me needing more. Jonathan Majors was FANTASTIC, one of my new favorite actors."
"Mar 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Should have listened to the internet‚Ä¶ wasted 12 dollars
"Mar 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,My least favorite marvel movie.
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked everything about the movie.  I am a Marvel junky.
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,I couldn‚Äôt make the show
"Mar 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as people let on - but nothing really special either. The film was initially underwhelming, but in retrospect, it is not the worst the MCU has offered audiences before. Paul Rudd gets more time to shine here and is as charming as ever. The supporting cast doesn't get much to do here, with newcomer Kathryn Newton being underutilized and her character not being used to her full effect. The real star here though is Johnathan Majors as KANG though! He is a force to reckon with from beginning to end, and totally made it worth the watch, if only just for his performance. The jokes and editing are probably the real things anchoring it down, but the Quantum realm and overall Sci-Fi tone change gave this series a fresh look it desperately needed. It doesn't live up to its full potential, but it's far from the worst this series ever had to offer. My score: 3.5/5."
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,i think this movie was worth it to watch in the teater and the end credits seen with loki in it that was sora a plot twist but i rate it 4.8 stars becuse there were some parts that were really perdictable in the move
"Mar 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I am a huge Antman fan and was kind of disappointed. It came off very strong on the sci-fi end of things and reminded me more of 
Star Wars / Star Trek or something. Cool visuals and plot was decent but overall just went a little too off the beaten path for me and didn't feel like something that belonged in the Antman series."
"Mar 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film tried to cram so much backstory in that it was an actual noticable distraction. The visuals were good and it had plenty of funny moments. There were too many plot conveniences where things came seemingly out of nowhere with minimal explanation. The ending left a bit to be desired but on the whole its a passable entry into the MCU. The writers just got a bit too caught up in new ideas that it feels removed from the first two Ant-Man movies, despite direct attempts to connect them. Felt more like an attempt to make a pseudo Avatar movie rather than a sequel to Ant-Man. But there were plenty of good scenes and the action sequences were well done. As long as you don't think too hard about what's going on its enjoyable enough."
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie started off a little slow. I was amazed with the costumes of the characters that they created in the quantum land. Very wild and crazy looking characters. Towards the middle it got more exciting, I am a Marvel diehard fan, so this was a very, very good picture."
"Mar 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not a fan. Didn't care for the story. Cast was good.
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Great fun - not sure why the critics were being so harsh with it. Definitely a film to see in the theater. 
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Great humor and visual stunning
"Mar 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Story was weak. No real further character development of the known characters and none at all of the ""B' characters.  A lot of questions.
Yet strangely still very enjoyable and entertaining."
"Mar 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible movie, 2hrs of my life I would never get back, unless if I get into the quantum realm and erase this movie!"
"Mar 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pesimo guion, pesimos efectos, aburrida mal editada otra pelicula olvidable de Marvel"
"Mar 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ridiculously long battles and just plain cheesy and hard to follow for kids.
"Mar 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not the worst, but not that great either.   It was certainly better than Marvel‚Äôs certain other films that were horrible."
"Mar 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was just ok. What really bothered me was Janet going a ridiculous lengths to avoiding to talk about Kang because talking about him right off the bat would have ruined the big reveal moment mid-way through the movie.  MODOK was horribly done; he's a giant head, he's pretty goofy, but the actual rendering of the CGI looked terrible.  Cassie was obnoxious over all.  Kang was supposed to be menacing, but he really just monologued a whole lot.  It really was just a mediocre movie."
"Mar 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst films I've seen in my life.  It was worse then Wakanda forever, which is saying something."
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was good, not Spiderman good but still an enjoyable movie. I went twice."
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best marvel movies after endgame hands down!
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,I like to entire movie
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Cassie was in the way and useless and the corny D joke was not needed and not funny. Kang was the truth but not used to full strength.
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the film. I thought the pacing was good, good story in itself and building to more of Kang. So imaginative."
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and explained a lot about the last movie.
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie enjoyed the new submission of the villain, I definitely hope we get the back story of who he is in the future."
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang was worth it for the MCU die hard, otherwise"
"Mar 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie delivered everything that fans have come to love about the Ant-Man franchise - humor, heart, and plenty of action - and then some. What really stood out to me was the new addition of Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror. He brought a captivating and complex presence to the film, making him a fantastic addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Overall, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' is a must-see for any Marvel fan or anyone looking for a funny, lighthearted, and overall enjoyable movie experience."
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a surprisingly fun movie. I recommend it.
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,It was funny and full of action.
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the graphics and story line
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,I Think the movie was awesome ! & so was the environment ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a great movie ... as good or better than both the other Ant-Man movies. It was a really fun movie to watch and I'm glad I got to see it in theaters. Can't wait to watch it again when it comes to Disney plus. No idea why anyone would give this movie a bad rating. The special effects were really good compared to movies only a few years older.
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Very fun trip through the Quantum Realm. Jonathan Majors is an excellent villian.
"Mar 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is great entertainment, this movie was an ok introduction to bring Kang into the MCU but I am not too sure if Ant-Man was the right guy for this, but story-wise is understandable to me. A bit miffed that we did not see Kang's full power and prowess in this movie but we probably will in future MCU movies."
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie to take my grandson's to.... I think that they really liked it.  Paul Rudd is always funny, we laughed a lot. Very funny that he gets cocky about being Ant Man but is still surprised by his own super powers. And don't leave the theater ...there's more to see at the very end!!"
"Mar 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Aside from Jonathan Majors, the acting was pretty flat. The graphics were really good and it was a cool story line but I just cant."
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, action, mystery, continuation of MCU"
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really fun movie, with good balance of laughs, heart, and action. Great Set-Up for the wider MCU as well :)"
"Mar 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Well, it's not bad movie and i like it. I can't wait to see what happens next, and i hope Marvel movies in the future are more concerned with Quality than Quantity."
"Mar 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,Could‚Äôve been a bit better still pretty fye
"Mar 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"O filme √© bem divertido, porem ... n√£o esta ao n√≠vel que a apresenta√ß√£o do Kang merecia. Al√©m de n√£o mudar nada no UCM."
"Mar 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,The story or plot needed more....
"Mar 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fell asleep within the first 15 minutes. The characters are horrible and the storyline wasnt good either.
"Mar 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very far fetched, slow moving, when it started picking up it slowed again."
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie. Not epic but the villain was amazing. Scott is a bit corky at times but it doesnt take away from a good entertaining movie. I fail to see why the critics gave it a 43% on rotten tomatoes. I can see it in the 70s.
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Haters gonna hate. Good movie overall, don't listen to the noise!"
"Mar 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was ok. Probably should have waited until it was on Disney+ 
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Action and humor combined
"Mar 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wish I was my version of the multiverse that did not spend time watching this movie.
I've always been particularly fond of Ant-Man, since his debut and I was looking forward to this movie for many reasons, including the fact that it was supposed to introduce Kang as a villain, which is a very interesting villain in the comics.
However, everything was lacking in this movie.
The acting is horrible, it doesn't look like anyone is actually trying, and they are such caricatures of themselves that you can't feel any real connection! I don't know if it was the actors' fault, but I doubt it since their previous works are good. It feels so rushed like only one take was shot for each scene, everyone was awkward.
The animation is uninspiring, I was expecting amazing things from the Quantum Realm, it is a completely different world where our physics does not necessarily apply, and anything is possible, but it was completely unoriginal and boring. The animations are somewhat well done, but the concepts themselves fall really flat. Not at all like the first Doctor Strange or even the first Ant-Man, which blew my mind the first time I watched it.
The plot is a mess, it has a nice premise, Kang is a very dangerous man, and letting him leave the Quantum Realm can be disastrous for many universes. So we have to fight him and protect our family at the same time. The problem was the execution, nothing feels earned, and the plot just happens almost randomly. 
I don't recommend watching this movie, it is a mess in its story, acting, effects and even pacing. Just read the summary to know how the MCU develops from it and never watch it again."
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it. It had a good story that leads into the next big event of the mcu.
"Mar 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's not perfect, but - in my opinion - it's a bit better than the critics say.

Redemption, bad communication, revenge - it's all piled up. Though I think maybe a few frame from Star Wars got included..."
"Mar 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,Achei divertido! Imagem e sim impec√°veis. Esperar o futuro da MCU
"Mar 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,At least it was entertaining and I didn't doze off.
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Phase 5 is off to a good start! Kang is here!!
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie, justvthe right amount of plot twists to be expected if youvwatched the Loki series. 

The theatre seats were uncomfortable though."
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,it was funny but lacking action.
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it adds standalone.  Ratings are misleading‚Ä¶ entertaining and purposeful.
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie and my son too.üëèüëè
"Mar 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kang is the new big bad. There, now you don't have to sit through this movie. What a disappointing Marvel movie."
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are clearly suffering from Marvel fatigue as this film is not nearly as bad as so many claim. I wonder if I saw a different film. The aesthetics are brilliant (as always). The story packs in a LOT--developing each character, providing a deeper back story to the Quantum realm, and giving viewers a fuller perspective of the overarching Kang narrative. The ""heist"" trope is barely an artifice in Quantumania as the film tilts more toward epic Marvel action than Ant Man comedy. Is this among my top 5 Marvel movies of all time? No--but neither is it in the bottom of the heap."
"Mar 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I feel like this was Marvel's version of Aquaman. Very colorful,  didn't make a lot of sense. It is an elaborate way to introduce Kang which I felt was very lack luster. Probably one of my least favorite Marvel movies."
"Mar 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was okay not spectacular.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, I personally thought it was great acting. Movie flew by was really entertaining. I would definitely see again."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed it and funny
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Disturbing creation of an underworld.  Very violent.  Didn't really care for the movie
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was good only thing that annoyed me was who they pick for Cassie but I got over it
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Immediately makes it into my worst three MCU movies. This felt lacklustre in every possible way & was a bit of an embarrassment to watch.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a fun movie and I enjoyed it. My suggestion to all the verified RT critics is to unplugged your brain and just relax when watching these type of movies. Stop expecting to see ""The Godfather"" every time you watch a movie. You'll be happier in the long run."
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,The first hour almost put us to sleep.  This might be appropriate for the 6-12 crowd.
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie was very slow almost fell a sleep. Paul rudd scott is One of my favorite Avengers. But in this movie it made me realize that anyone with a suit can do the job.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,The first half of the movie went extremely well. Everything was well told and on point visually. Personally the movie felt short and the end felt a bit underwhelming. But I definitely had a great time watching it! There is one mid credit scene and one post credit.
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,How long previews took
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun film that sets up the Multiverse and wants to come from Kang nicely. A Star Wars feel.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a really fun movie.  Not because it is overly emotional or has deep drama.  It is escapism at its best - a light hearted adventure in a fantastical universe.  It has a good story arc, introduces new characters, and humanizes the main antagonist.  I would have liked to see a little less of MODOK, but thats the only negative thing."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some unnecessary characters, snappy comebacks, and heavily relied on cheap jokes but despite setbacks, this movie provides looming introduction toward the Kang saga with the entirety of the movie and end credits scene, actors/actresses make the best with the script they have, with more comic accurate suits, and even though there are some plot holes, the cast brought the humanity throughout that determined the future of the MCU."
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really enjoyed the first 2 Ant Man movies, but this 3rd one just felt like watching a cartoon or George Lucas playing with his sandbox of CGI gimmikery from the Star Wars prequels. Very little plot to speak of and a film so ultimately dull even my teenage son fell asleep during it. Maybe Marvel should stick to Quality rather than Quantity."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Full of action keeper true the Ani-Man trilogy. Must see!
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,It‚Äôs a funny movie to watch with the family
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"M√°s de los mismo, un monton de personas peleandose con otro monton, chingos de lucesitas y la misma aburrida paleta de colores y chistes malos, nada innovador ni sorprendente ni esperado, no aporta nada a  ninguna historia, ni siquiera a su propia historia, nunca empatizas con ningun personaje y pues nada."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a great Ant-man movie.  I miss Luis though.
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel phase 5 kicks off with the taste of Ant Man. Some high expectations with average results. The movie takes a ok start getting the audience in. As soon as the plot takes over the movie starts feeling really slow the action doesn't feel good. The climax is when the movie actually does it's best. Everything happening all at once with great intensity states. Action feels appealing with a solid purpose. Acting is best by Paul Rudd and the villain, others were ok with the acting. Comedy is fairly kicked in certain times feels good. The runtime is actually fine but plot makes it feel slow."
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,Would have liked it more if it had been in 3D.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I Loved This Film , Great Writing, Great Cast, Great Acting, Great CGI, and Special FX......  I REALLY Enjoyed And Appreciate This Film..... Saw it Twice ....."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel has done it again.  This was a very good movie and it is setting things up nicely for another big ""Infinity War"" type of conclusion.  Well done!"
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"When I watch Marvel Movies Im always excited to watch them over and over again and theyre always lengthy.  As I watched this movie couldnt wait for it to be over just waiting for the end. Marvel Movies are exciting fun to watch and lot of jokes. This one was mostly seriousness throughout and few lane jokes. I left feeling like I missed something. However, I could have waited for this to be released in Disney Plus because it lacked excitement."
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Overestimated. It presents Kang, but he doesn't represent even 50% of Thanos's treat."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,So many people panned this movie but I believe they missed the point. My granddaughter and I laughed at some parts until our stomachs hurt. It's a fun watch. Just don't take it so seriously.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sooooo Gooooooodd!!!!!!!
Hands Down !!!"
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Marvel is putting out too many movies just to make them now. They should worry more about the story than the special effects.  There were obviously good parts and funny moments, but quality of past few Marvel movies is noticeably on the decline"
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,O filme foi bem divertido
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"After the backlash, I was expecting worse, it is definitely entertaining. Maybe the most fun I had with a Marvel movie since infinity war."
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I fell asleep 3 times during the movie so 5-3=2 stars, and that was generous. Although I liked the cast, 90% of the movie was extremely boring dialog. The end picked up a little bit, but not enough to save it."
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,I saw this movie because it was the first movie of phase 5.
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Story content, actors and special effects."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the sounds and special effects
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,You have to understand the comic books to truly appreciate this movie. It isnt your typical marvel movie thats straightforward like the iron mans and captain americas but its setting up the whole Kang dynasty which is going to shock a lot of people. Im seriously looking forward to seeing where this is going and what character arcs are going to be ended by Kang.
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Muito ruim, Jonathan Majors carrega o filme nas costas. O Kang (vil√£o que seria mais forte que o Thanos) ser derrotado por formigas √© demais."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Very nice movie great action!! Can‚Äôt wait to see how they defeat all of the other Kahn !!!
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn‚Äôt make it to the show
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, super entertaining and the perfect movie to see with your kids."
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,Overall I think this was a pretty good movie. I was missing out on some of the comedy from his friend Luis. I think this is a great setup for things to come.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than expected.
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not nearly as good as the first two. Not family friendly due to language and sexual innuendo. No story. All CGI. All show and no go. Very disappointed!
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,not bad. interesting concept. better than I expected.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie, or I should say, the actor who portrayed the Wasp, was excellent! He made that story work with his calmness, almost nonchalant, with the way he portrayed himself..would definitely recommend seeing this movie"
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining, great cast."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not the greatest MCU flick, but not the worst.  Better CGI than script but still entertains."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely wonderful!!! Thank you üôè
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The actresses that portrayed Cassie Lang ruined each and every scene she was in. It was the first Marvel movie that I actually fell asleep in.
And Marvel continues making Scott Lang a second fiddle in his own movie. 
Unfortunately Phase 5 is continuing the disastrous streak of bad movies.
Ant-Man wasn't as bad as the Eternals or Thor Love and Thunder but it was yet another bad movie. 
I will be very hesitant buying theater tickets for another Marvel movie that is not Spider-Man."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed the movie and his it brings more detail to the multiverse, introduces the next phase, and ties in the Disney+ series."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"We enjoyed the movie, however we had some very rude moviegoers in the theater with us this time."
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,The first part was slow. Not a movie I would watch again.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"A good 3rd entry to the Ant-Man series. Kang was a spectacular introduction to the MCU and he will definitely leave his mark. Good humor, as expected with an Ant-Man film!"
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Great use of special effects and new syrup creatures
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,not nearly as bad as critics say. still disappointing and seemed rushed or poorly thought out.
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,WHERE IS IRON MAN?!?!?!?
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was really good and I really enjoyed it and I liked it 
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,Didnt hit like other ones last 45 movie was good
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,Antman flicks are always sub par and this one was another stretch.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,another great marvel movie...introducing new characters...looking forward to the next one like ussual... goes along with loki
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Doesn't hold back and gets straight into the story of ant-man within the quantum realm. We all know kanv is the next big bad and seeing his story start to unfold had me glued to the screen! Ant-man and his team gave the laughter and plenty of action throughout, MODOK could have had a bigger story but he was just as funny as I remember from seeing the TV show on Disney. Paul Rudd and Jonathan Myers are brilliant as always and I can't wait to see more of kang! All in all a good plot, amazing visuals, funny and full of action. Spoilers - One thing I would of preferred is to have higher stakes as it is kang and the next big bad I thought he would have at least taken one of the antman members down before seemingly being defeated. This movie is perfect for starting phase 5 and personally my favourite mcu film since endgame (excluding no way home). Must watch!"
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If Kang is supposed to be more powerful than Thanos, how could they defeat him so easily?"
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,The constant sarcasm works. Then the neurotic spell at the end when he over-analyzes EVERYTHING!
"Mar 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie lacked suffifient action.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wasn't that bad,  felt rushed and the Quantumania universe needed more tweeking so it can be more interesting to audiences to want to visit or care about it. What I enjoyed the most about the movie Janet Van Dyne had her secrets and it came back to haunt her, her family and soon the universe."
"Mar 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,Really liked Jonathan Major as the villain!
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I was pretty good movie
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Love every bit of it
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Just wasn't the best storyline
"Mar 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,You get what you'd expect from a superhero movie. Things blow up. Jokes are made. The day is saved. Is it going to go down in Marvel history? No. Did I have a fun time at the movies? Totally.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,i really like this movie it had a great plot. it was a smart well made movie.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it. But I admit that I'm biased. I do think some things were unnecessary haha. Overall, important movie for the overall story line."
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved it. Super entertaining. I put it in the camp of Deadpool where it was super fun, and didn't take itself too seriously. Anyone rating this poorly is taking themselves too seriously"
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid entry to the MCU. Definitely an improvement over AM2. Kang is as evil as they come. No Way M.O.D.O.K. wasn't going to be an odd & humorous entry to that world. Mircoverse made the most sense. Very well acted. Importance of family got me. Not sure what people expected or why the hate.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,the characters and the whole movie
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie some scenes are very boring but the rest is fine
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,The special effects were crazy amazing. The storyline and references were easy to follow.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing movie! It's definitely a must see. Paul Rudd is great as usual! And everyone else did a phenomenal job. Literally one of my top fav marvel movies.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome, simply awesome!"
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Misma formula, pero considero que cumple con lo que requiere el universo cinematografico de Marvel actualmente."
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una buena pelicula, no es algo tan grande como lo son las peliculas de los vengadores pero cumple para lo que es. Buena historia, muy entretenida y Kang se ve muy imponente."
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun and impressive. For me it lacked of continuity with the first 2 films (Luis and other characters and scenes like que one in the bathroom in AntMan) but the villain is incredible and it was more interesting that I believed.
"Mar 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Carece de carisma, desperdi√ßa um vil√£o mt importante üç∑üóø"
"Mar 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The whole show was not as good as the first two.
The story was confusing and made no sense.."
"Mar 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You go to this movie because you feel you need to‚Ä¶ just in case Marvel picks themselves up off the mat and delivers again. Keep going, but unfortunately, keep wishing."
"Mar 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fine, entertaining and decent script. Not sure I will see it again but glad I saw it. I did see it in 4D which was a mistake. Air, smells, mist and lights were great, but the chairs flying all over was insane. I mean it was teeth jarring."
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"My daughter and I loved it. A true escape from the mundane and a fitting, spectacular entry into the marvel universe. A Teddy Roosevelt said ""it's not the critic who counts"".  Glad I ignored them."
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,It had a lot of action almost from the start.  Comedy was mixed in at the right times.  The storyline played out with the promise of a future movie.
"Mar 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was definitely the best version of Ant-Man, Kang was menacing as Jonathan Majors was able to nail his role perfectly however even with the brilliant acting of Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd this movie finds its ways to flop as the movie was all over the place, the run time was definitely too short for a ""high-stakes"" movie and it failed to live up to an ""avengers level movie"" with the final act being a disaster. Not the best Ant-Man movie and totally not worth rewatching."
"Mar 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was decent. What I didn't like was the plot. (SPOILER ALERT) Cassy becomes interested in the quantum realm. So somehow she builds a hi-tech device in her basement, without her dad knowing about it, that allows her to communicate with the quantum realm, all because she found that she was interested in it. Somehow, something goes wrong (shocker), and they magically get teleported to the quantum realm. The rest was decent, I just wish they did a better job of getting them into the quantum realm. It felt like Wakanda Forever, they rushed into the action way too fast. Decent movie."
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I love that it had ever you want in a good movie.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"As per usual I completely agree with the audience score and take the critic's reviews and throw them in the trash. This movie was a lot of fun, was it perfect? No, but it was really good. It had some humor but not over the top. Paul Rudd was great but Johnathon Majors stole the show. His portrayal as Kang was simply Amazing. This being the first of the Phase 5 movies, really jump starts what to me was a pretty underwhelming Phase 4. Majors was menacing and as the Antagonist for the MCU going forward, it leaves Marvel fans eager with anticipation for where this journey is going to take us. MODOK was also a nice addition to the MCU and loved his interaction with the ""Ant Family."" Michelle Pfiefer and Michael Douglas brought stability to the movie and I loved the bond that was shown between Scott and Cassie Lang. Definitely a Marvel movie I will watch again multiple times. My only disappointment was that I paid any attention to what the stupid ass critics poor reviews were and didn't go see this movie sooner. Overall I just loved this really fun Comic Book Movie. I highly recommend going to the Theater and checking it out if you haven't seen it yet."
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie enough to see it several times. The story,visual effects,set design,prompts ,music score,acting all very much top rated. I wish this did as well as Avatar the Way of at the box office.I found this very much all around enjoyable. Two thumbs up from me"
"Mar 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-man was cool guys in terms of a movie it falls a little short for me in terms of a setup for phase 5 and beyond it is a competent set up and introduction to a new big bad , a new world , new stakes and a new saga. The goal of this movie was the latter and for that I objectively look through it through that lens. This biggest selling point of the movie was easily Jonathan Majors. The rest of the cast fell kind of flat. Action scenes could have been a little better and some decisions the characters make will have you confused with that being said the movie was still able to entertain and move phase 5 forward showing the power of possible it's best villain yet."
"Mar 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While there were definitely some great moments, especially involving Kang, the story felt sluggish and unimportant. Marvel keeps missing the mark as they forget to focus on writing compelling characters within their storylines. Quality over quantity, please!"
"Mar 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Remember the fun Ant-Man movies?  This ant ain‚Äôt it.   Another paint by numbers marvel movie with uninspired CG doing the heavy lifting.
"Mar 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not so much, felt too lazy"
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this new phase of Marvel. Paul Rudd was great and the story was great.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,it was very good movie and it had some very good special effects in the movie
"Mar 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not enough action, bad storyline and too much animation."
"Mar 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you didn't see Loki Season 1 before this and you haven't met Kang, then you're going to not like it. It's kind of simple as that. It's campy and wild, but it's meant to be. The poor reviews from critics shows they didn't understand the context because the movie doesn't provide much explanation about what you learn in Loki."
"Mar 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring and mediocre movie. Not worth watching it at the cinema.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal graphics will blow you away! Good story line, but at times difficult to follow."
"Mar 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wow so good it ducks relly pual is good but the other actors suck this movie sucks lol üòÇ
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a good movie, the villain is amazing and the steaks are high."
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Took my kid to see it. Movie didnt miss the mark. As a comicbook fan I was excited to see how the continue tha Khan story amd the movie did Khan justice.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,don't know why this movie is getting so much hate. Compared to phase 4 this movie was great
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Special effects. Wish would have idd actors prior to movie
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super fun! Everything you would expect in an MCU. Don't listen to the critics, they're just hating. There is some strange plot things in it which are weird. Some don't make hit the mark but overall very enjoyable movie"
"Mar 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it's Marvel! however, the campy Ant-man jokes just don't hit this time."
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie! The story and special effects were magnificent! Kang the Conqueror is the new Thanos if even badder!!!!
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,There was nothing I disliked it was an ok movie but it is definitely a one time watch for me.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,A solid 8 out 10 movie!!!!!!! This is how you start the new phase of the Marvel Universe!!!!! Plus the new villain Kang The Conqueror is more powerful!!! Than both Thanos from Infinity War and Endgame.
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm a Marvel fan.  The movie was absolutely great!
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing!!! Can't wait for another movie.
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a very funny, exciting, and visually stunning movie."
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good special effects and of course loved the humor.
"Mar 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,Story wasnt very cohesive or interesting.  11 and 16 yr old felt same.
"Mar 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie quality was good overall from the movie. But Kathryn Newton was just not it for the role.
"Mar 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,Unlike most people i enjoyed this movie for what it was. Wasnt a great story anything but it was a fun watch none the less. Some scenes were cringey but thats a given seeing as its a marvel movie. MODOK was waste of a character imo. Kang was great in this movie. Every scene he was in was amazing. Just wish he won at the end of the movie but lost to ants smh.
"Mar 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Cassie is terrible, Jentorra warrior is lame, and Hank and Hope did nothing. Modak's intro was pretty good, but he sucked. The only good character was Kang and Scott, even though they didn't do anything."
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,QuANTMANia was super cool. Lots of special effects. Would recommend 
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una buena pelicula mostrando algo mas en el UCM que conectara finalmente los puntos entre series y peliculas que se crearon en la fase 4 y 5, gracias al post-creditos vemos como se necesitara de una legion de heroes para combatir lo qu se viene a futuro. Se podria incluso explorar una serie sobre las aventuras dentro del reino cuantico ya que todo es posible ah√≠."
"Mar 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really grew tired of the fake CGI monstrosity that is the MCU these days. This film isn't a total waste of time thanks to Michelle Pfeiffer that white gold, and Jonathan Majors's Kang who is doing the most, and then some, but at least he is earning his paycheck. Paul Rudd is always charming as Ant-Man, but Evangeline Lilly is very much wasted, and so is Michael Douglas (for the most part). I am not too optimistic about the next phase of Marvel, even though Kang is a fantastic super villain. There is just too many worlds, timelines, possibilities, not to mention how fake and low-stake everything seems, and these all makes me care less not more about what's coming next. I see now that the MCU should have ended with ""Endgame"" while they were ahead."
"Mar 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,We were expecting so much more: CGI was incredible - characters were flat and uninteresting... almost fell asleep 4 times!
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The special effects were great. Fast paced action with some really funny moments
"Mar 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not their best work, but it's still Paul Rudd. It felt like the writers were trying to ""boldly go where no man had gone before"" and make a Marvel movie with a Star Trek story line."
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Paul Rudd killed it in this movie! I loved how it felt like a phase 2 movie. I was laughing and even on the edge of my seat. Highly reccomeded!
"Mar 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It just feels like the mcu is slowly trudging along at this point, this movie feels like it was hastily re written and reshot at the last second, which it probably was, this movie could've been so so much better."
"Mar 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A very colorful movie, but too much going and it dragged on way to long the reason Pim left the QRealm"
"Mar 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's not really a bad movie especially the plot and modak but Kang did an amazing job
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie. Major's performance was excellent. I am very excited to see more of Kang in future Marvel titles. There were funny and touching moments, and I was entertained throughout. I have seen all the Marvel movies, but I am not a die hard fan of the comics, so I can't really comment on the authenticity of the movie to the source material, but as a regular Marvel movie and TV show level of fan I found this movie enjoyable and not sure why it got so much hate from the critics."
"Mar 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is a movie that you will like when you see it, it will entertain you but you will not want to repeat it. It's not something that adds much to the MCU's past and probably won't add to the future either. I see it flat and the jokes are so constant."
"Mar 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bad plots for introduction of the next Marvel's supervillain.
"Mar 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,My only real problem was Modok and the number of times they said the d word in what is supposed to be a family film. Other than that it was fine and pretty much what I expected.
"Mar 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The Movie has Great graphics, animations and Actors. However there are multiple one dimensional characters such as the daughter of Scott lang  and the rebel leader, where you know in an instant what they are going to say and what stupid things they are going to do. While the daughter reminds me of rey in the last trash star wars sequels, I feel that the rebel leader character was Done without love just to have a strong woman as some strong warrior. If you want to emphasise on strong women then do that correctly and come up with characters who are rather unpredictable than predictable. My biggest problem with the film however is that Kang, the universally strong bad guy(whose concept of an army of himselfs I love) is just not written in this movie as a character for himself. Whilst having his own goal to escape it seems like in all critical moments he just lets everything happen whilst he should be thousands of times stronger than ant man and the other even less strong characters here. A little example for the bad writing is the stupid fact that every time he captured any of the good characters and they are being held somewhere or walked around, they still have they're weapons on them, they're suits, they don't have any shackles on or just the simplest thing to keep the prisoner from being a menace. Why should a prisoner still be allowed to have all of that freedom and why wouldn't kang immediately kill these threats if he cares so little about life. In the end the movie reminds me of the last Star Wars Finale because of the lack of logic inside of the movie. Kang was nerved so hard that the good guys where somehow able to win and he had  multiple questionable moments where he could have(with his immense power experience and background in mind) easily escaped or won. 
In conclusion I would say it is a badly written amazingly looking and for the most part also well acted movie, which apart from the good guys, only has the goal to somehow make the happy ending happen rather then to tell an exiting and in itself logical story that also respects the character of Kang."
"Mar 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a train wreck of a movie, all these moving pieces couldn't find a moving moment for the film. Lackluster actually boring strangely. marvel had to know this was bad. It sets ground work for a possible good movie later."
"Mar 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,Liked the action but thought it would be more epic since it included Kang
"Mar 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ruim. Mais do mesmo. Parece que a criatividade acabou.
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Have you ever seen any of the ant man's? this was my first and I was impressed.
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Paul Rudd funny movie was very action packed never a dull moment
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel Cinematic Universe yet again presents another key 
step in their evolution ladder. While it is not to be comparable 
with Endgame or Guardian's of The Galaxy Vol. 1 it does introduce 
a Kang that made me stagger as he looked better than if we could 
Kang actually pluck him out of the original classic comics, 
Jonathan Majors is truly Kang and his armor looks better 
than the original we saw in the comics. Now Modok was the 
Jar Jar Binks for MCU that was a misfire. I encourage particularly
Marvelites, there are astounding sequences in this film. I give it 
a 8.5 and yes better than Thor Love and Thunder. See it for yourself."
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked everything about it.
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,overall pretty good movie. feels like it was missing something though
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, characters, villain and special effects!"
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Never boring, visually entertaining and with one of Marvel's best villains. Not sure why all the hate."
"Mar 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Idk what all the hate is about. It was a little too star wars for me, but still a quality movie."
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"My favorite of the Ant Man films. Has classic Disney family movie charm in my opinion, despite all the sequels this probably sets up, I believe it's a great contained story about family, and Choice vs Fate."
"Mar 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,Graphiques where horrible .They where not committed to this project . Why bother wasting ressources? Can we pause on super hero movies? What's the point ! Disney/ Marvel have lost it!
"Mar 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jonathan Majors is a superb villain, but the movie premise as a whole is dumb and they turned Cassie Lang into a sanctimonious a-hole. And I simply have no words to describe the vandalism done to MODOK."
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"My wife and I REALLY enjoyed this meeting. The engaging story gives the main characters a lot to do, especially Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors. Rudd and Lily are very comfortable in their roles and knock it out of the park with some new challenges and experiences. Almost all of the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm, which is beautiful, mysterious, and deadly. 

Even if you are not a Marvel fan or have not seen any of the other movies, it's a heck of a ride. It's close to Marvel's best, and certainly the best thing they have released to theatres (along with Wakanda Forever) in 2-3 years."
"Mar 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"worst marvel movie EVER. Acting was subpar the dialog was awful and the costumes looked like they took left over star wars costumes and tried to put them to use. the fact that this made it post production this way, says alot about the desperation of the franchise."
"Mar 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was ok. I did fall asleep on it for a bit. There was no it factor for me. Not as funny as previous films, storyline was not there"
"Mar 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,please no more uninspired super hero movies
"Mar 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,All the marvel PP riders in the reviews need to learn what a bad movie is. This is a bad movie.
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,very enjoyable good vs evil movie.
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like all of it, except the end, where he was back and walking around his town."
"Mar 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not the best marvel movie. Marvel has a good reputation that's why people expect so much from them. This one was honestly just not it I feel like there was no real plot or excitement mostly just random stuff and random fight scenes.
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining and many funny parts:-)
"Mar 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I thought it was just awful. I have to admit, nostalgia got me through the door. But just the overall dumbing down of plot and characters just didn't do it for me.

Also, why name it Ant-Man and the Wasp, if the Wasp character is going to be regulated to the back in most scenes?

Anyway... Yeah"
"Mar 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Another disaster from the DCMU the story was terrible another movie that should have been great that was terrible.
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best ant man movie so far.
"Mar 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Oh man, Marvel is struggling üòÖ.  This one lost me with the nauseating visuals and CGI.  I think the story could have been better too.  Ultimately though, Marvel movies have lost a lot of their luster in phase 4 with subpar writing and character development highlighting this phase.  Hopefully, Disney can right the ship or people will not be circling these releases on their calendars anymore ü´£"
"Mar 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,A great watch if you're a Marvel junkie. This new Ant Man flick added a lot of great characters from the comics with the MCU take on it. Had a story that was enjoyable. More of a comedy than an action but nothing wrong with that. Paul Rudd really stole the show for me. I enjoy his personality as the Ant Man. My only issue was that Kang the Conqueror seemed like a pushover. Didn't feel like that big bad guy we were expecting from the comics.
"Mar 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As the critics say, it lacked the spark and the joy of his previous adventures. This movie takes a much darker turn. You are taken by surprise by how the film series has changed. But you are even more surprised when you hear regular Ant-Man humor! If this was a smaller-scale, regular Ant-Man movie, it would work much better. I wish the Wasp had more to do, Modok was wasted beyond comparison, and overall, things just felt different. It wasn't bad by any means, but not the best movie. I do think people give Johnathan Majors just a TAD bit too much credit, but still stunning acting. Paul Rudd is great, Kathryn Newton and Michelle Pfeiffer aced it, and everything else was good. The visual effects in the first act were pretty bad half the time, but the rest of the film was STUNNING. Not Avatar 2 level stunning, but still great. I enjoyed the movie more than Thor: Love and Thunder (decent at best). This movie was decent at worst. I'd recommend seeing it just to know what the MCU is going to look like in the future."
"Mar 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,a hand full of actors in a cgi-world. the trailer was boring - the film even worse...
"Mar 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Its an ok watch.  the story could have been better.  there was some big plot wholes in the story.  if you don't watch like a movie critic, you may find that you can enjoy the fantasy ride.  Just that it could have been better."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than what most people give it credit for. An excellent Ant-Man 3.
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent continuation of Ant-Man's story post-Endgame, loved the exploration of Janet's character and progression of Cassie's character, and incredible setup for the villain of Kang, who is even more interesting and complex and mysterious and intimidating than Thanos already. Also loved MODOK and glad they went full cheesy with the character instead of trying to make him serious. The quantum realm was also incredible visually, a bizarre new world beneath us. This movie finally has me excited about the MCU again, and I can't wait to see Kang in the future."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one if the first ones since Endgame that wasn't super depressing. I loved it, I felt like we were finally getting back to the fun/excitement of Marvel movies. I used to watch them multiple times int he theater and that has only happened with 2 others since Endgame. This is now one and I will probably see it again. My favorite Ant-Man to date."
"Mar 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was very interesting but I think they took it a little to far (I loved the villan and the ending)
"Mar 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great special effectsdidnt need the language
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Very epic next step into the mcu
"Mar 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A bit of a mess, but still a good time. 
Quantumania is a departure, of sorts, for Ant-man, getting away from the heist-centric plots and becoming more of a sci-fi epic. The cast is strong, with Jonathan Majors stealing the show. The CGI effects were solid, but pervasive. The humor, unfortunately, fell mostly flat and felt forced. The story, while good, was hampered by lazy writing and a dependence on plot devices. While I enjoyed the spectacle, I feel like this was a missed opportunity."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Very well done with interesting characters and visual effects.
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is very good, amazing things like the special effects that are excellent and it manages to engage, the downside is modok who is one of the worst villains for me but the rest is fine, but kang is an excellent character

"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Tempted to give it 5 stars because it was a visual delight, and I want to support films like this that I enjoyed, I'm with the 5 star review that said they didn't know what the critics were talking about. 

Whoever cast Michelle Pfeiffer is a genius, possibly necessary since regardless of knowing what the storyline is, there's no cast of characters like there is in, say, Guardians of the Galaxy. There isn't a lot an actor can do if they aren't the focus but are more of a plot device or a trope, they have to transcend the movie, for example I don't remember the names of most of the characters even though I just saw it. All the actors may have done this to some extent, since I could see them as bringing something to their roles. In contrast I could barely get through the 4th Star Wars movie premiere, one might have thought Natalie Portman was a wooden puppet of an actor, but she wasn't in other movies and I suspect you would have to be Samuel Jackson to be able to add anything beyond that fully-realized vision, or to add anything to the role of tree that doesn't talk or raccoon that does. 

Most importantly to me and what I couldn't find a lot of information on, I like this genre, and really wanted to see it and see it in 3D on a big screen, but was concerned that I would have trouble as I have hit the movie trifecta of photosensitivity, audio sensitivity, and get motion sick. I haven't made it through some movies and often need to sit quietly in dim lighting afterwards. I had no problem and even surprised myself by feeling well enough to dance a bit while exiting the theater (it was completely empty). 

Upshot: critics panned it so much, a lot of people didn't see it, I'm glad I did anyway. It wasn't as funny as the first Ant Man, I didn't see the second one, and there are some Marvel movies that were more popular with critics and fans that I enjoyed less. Someone said it might be better not to expect too much, but to think of it like an episode in a series, that's a good way to approach it since that has killed some movies for me, but it's also not something you have to go into expecting less or cross-referencing everything in the Marvel Multiverse to enjoy seeing."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, funny enough, serious enough, prepare the phase 5. Great Kang actor even if Kang is a capricious kid,
For sure he will come back more evil,
Good Sci fi,"
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Ant-Man series has always been considered rather unimportant, but this film is very important to the MCU, as we get the first look at Kang, who was superbly portrayed by Jonathan Majors.

The movie offers you everything you would expect from a good Marvel movie, from action to comedy, it's all there. The plot makes sense and the end is comprehensible, good entertainment and another piece of the puzzle in the MCU."
"Mar 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Totally disneyfied to be family-friendly and selling toys afterwards. Childish, formulaic, predictable... it helps to avoid taedum vitae for a couple of hours - but other than that, is simply another scratch on the corpse of the marvel tiger that Dinsey keeps dragging out of death of innovation."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant Man Surpassed my Expectations. Visual and Special Affects are Incredible!
 I Enjoyed it immensely.
The Plot Changes as Movie Progresses, action, Excitement, Relational Struggles, Conflict. Whats not to like?"
"Mar 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I love the way Kang is introduced in this film, where its more of a supervillain intro story rather than a normal good guy beats bad guy (although this did sort of happen). I am though slightly disappointed at the final scene where mega ants were involved as I wouldn't have imagined that kind of ""method of defeat"". Overall I would still recommend watching it, the storyline is quite important as a build up to Avengers: The Kang Dynasty."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good videography, good story line."
"Mar 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wasnt a fan. Luckily I won tickets to see this movie and it was free. I love Paul Rudd and Michelle Pfeiffer but it was eh. Srcond half of the movie was kinda dumb and corny.
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,By far one of favorite Marvel movies.
"Mar 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought it was a satisfying movie at best. Going in, I wasn't expecting a cinematic masterpiece like Avengers Endgame and Spider-Man No Way Home. 

GOOD:
Kang the Conqueror was the highlight of the movie for me; I got Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine vibes whenever he was on screen.  

Scott Lang was entertaining as always, with his sense of humor. 

I actually liked the Star Wars vibes in the Quantum Realm. This is something people have critiqued about the film, but I really enjoyed it. 

The slightly darker tone of this movie in contrast to its prequels was also nice to have, since the next Thanos-level threat makes his first appearance. 

The Mid Credits/Post Scene: Meeting the Council of Kangs on the big screen was exciting, although I found the variants shouting to be goofy. I also liked seeing Loki and Mobius again.

THE BAD:

MODOK: He looked more like a Humpty Dumpty cyborg than the comic accurate version. Him being the butt end of jokes did not convince me that he was much of a threat. His redemption also did not pay off for me.

Cassie Lang: I thought the actress from Avengers Endgame made the character more likeable. I found Cassie a bit annoying from time to time in this movie.

Luis: Where was Luis???

The Climax: I was expecting to see higher stakes in this movie, given how dangerous Kang is said to be. The marketing gave off the impression that Scott Lang might die in the movie, but Kang dies instead (or did he?).

Bottom Line: See it in the theatre while it's still playing, but don't go in with Avengers Infinity War/Avengers Endgame level expectations.

Rating: 77.5/100"
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, great setup for the next phase."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Took my son to it tonight and we both enjoyed it!
"Mar 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The first antman movies were fun and with good effects, now is more like a video game and very illogical, marvel has lost their touch."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie
"Mar 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"One of the better recent MCU movies. Better than Ant Man 2 not quite as good as Ant Man 1. Kang was a great addition to the storyline. As usual, great action and great comedy. 7 out of 10."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"The reviews are crap.  This was a highly enjoyable movie that I would definitely recommend going to see.  Was it perfect? No.  However, how many movies are perfect?  Almost everyone I know that has seen the movie enjoyed it and is glad they went."
"Mar 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pretty lame story line along with tired old actors from the past in unbelievable roles. Can see why IHOP was giving away tickets with purchases of meals...which were better than the movie.
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great movie panned by critics.
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed the movie, so many questions from loki Season 1 was answered, absolutely love the direction this is going. Some may not like how kang was weak in the movie, but they need to understand that kang has been defeated in the comics many times , people need to look at the big pictures. The story is is deeper than it looks and so many details and information will fly over a normal viewer. I understood so much that was going on due to having deep knowledge of past events and stories in mcu which made it more enjoyable to watch than the amount of enjoyment a normal viewer would have. CGI was great besides modok looked weird."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Just a fun movie that was entertaining
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie.  Visually awesome!  Great special effects. As good as the first one, maybe better."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"So good intense, funny, and action packed!"
"Mar 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as the critics say. Not the best ant man. But better than Dr strange and the last thor...
Jonathan Majors is awesome as usual....
But way too much hugging and family things. Reminds me of vin deisal and his family issues in fast and the furious ü§£ü§£ü§£"
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was interesting and kept you on your toes to consider who was the villian, spoiled person, working adventures, and heros.  Listen to the clues to what is coming next."
"Mar 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed this addition to the larger storyline. It moved the story of the Secret Wars forward by giving us another look at Kang after the introduction in Loki S1. This was a good intro to Kangs back story. If you understand this film is part of a much larger story arc youll enjoy it.
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, lots of fun watching the action."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was great, wish MODOK was used more threateningly, but otherwise had a great time with the movie"
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything
Go to the movies to be entertained and forget about everyday drama.  Nice change from my normal.
Lots of action and great special effects."
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I had a good nap about 15 min into it.  Tired of the multiverse.  Don't need to see it again, except for the parts I missed while asleep."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, great story line and action"
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the special affects.
"Mar 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's very entertaining
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"main actress, Cassie, was a really horrible actor. It seemed like she just got out of acting school AKA an alley behind a laundromat where a hobo named Pinkie taught."
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,The bad guy with the big head looked like it could have came from the movie Shark Boy and Lava Girl. Terrible idea!
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't have high expectations for this film, yet I found it really charming and fun. Definitely my favorite of the Ant Man franchise. Jonathan Majors was just crazy good and added so much as well."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very action packed!  Loved the CGI!
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I have to say that this movie was pretty good. I really like the family aspect of the story.
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Im not gonna say it was phenomenal. Id say it was pretty ok. Im a huge Marvel fan, so I understand that each movie is actually more about the prelude to the next Marvel movie. 

The story line was good. They just had some very corny scenes. In my opinion, those should have been deleted scenes or B-roll."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Best ant flim the in the trilogy in my opinion kang is here and he don't disappoint!
"Mar 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,I dont agree with the critics. Not that bad. Average movie. Good enough to entertain the fans. Kang is good. Could be as good as thanos as he will appear again in future MCU. MODOK is bad idea though. Should be just a new character.
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good action, and funny."
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not my favorite Marvel movie, probably wouldn‚Äôt watch again."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very exciting. Kept up in suspicion.
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's Tron and Tron Legacy lacking any and all of the creativity and style that went into those films. Just more of the same grey goop that Marvel is continuing to flush through its rectal pipes into the faces of the gormless consumers who cannot see Marvel movies for the liquid faeces they have become.
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it cant wait to see the next one
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,mcu is dead.. dead..
"Mar 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's an okay film, not that good but not that bad also. Kang's ability feels like it got nerf to be a universal or Avenger's level threat"
"Mar 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was engaging and entertaining from start to finish. Best movie of the marvel phase 4 by far, so far! Looking forward to what comes next."
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Average movie. Not so bad not so good
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,kindly slow for the most part
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Disliked how weak they made Kang. Vibe was cool tho
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the message and it was some of the best CGI to date. Very psychedelic and amazing visuals. I felt the story was just okay, but the visuals were so stimulating that it didn‚Äôt matter that much. Overall, it was a good time. My biggest complaint is some of it felt styled a little like Star Wars."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It was funny and kept me intrigued the whole time!
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It was action packed!! Exciting and funny
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,i thought it was really good dont know why so many people disliked it
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was great good action, slight humor. Actually think it was better than the second Ant-man. The movie did what it needed to do to further along the MCU storyline. Totally enjoyed it"
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang stole the show. VFX were absolutely stunning. Plot was a little complicated and underwhelming sometimes but I still enjoyed it overall. If you like marvel you should totally watch it. Otherwise it‚Äôs a mid watch.
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Just your basic Marvel movie.  Cool special effects.  OK story.  Biggest disappointment was that there was little comic relief.  So miss Michael Pena!
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"***Spoilers ahead: The third installment was really great! Definitely enjoyed it a lot. Idk what it is about Kathryn Newton but she irks me. She bugged me in supernatural too, but i guess then she's doing a good job acting as head strong teenager. When i first saw the trailer i initially thought Scott was going to be tricked by Kang, that Kang convinces Scott that if he helps him he'll get to travel back in time and spend those lost years with Cassie. I also thought it would have also been interesting if instead of immediately introducing Kang as the evil ruler of the quantum realm, that he presents himself as some roguish mysterious character who pretends to help Scott and Cassie get the time and space device. As for MODOK, I didn't hate his design but i kinda felt like the movie would've been fine without him, he felt a little out of place. I missed Luis, wished they could have tied Scott's pals into this one somehow‚Ä¶what happened to Ex-Con security? Overall i really loved the design of the quantum realm and all the characters in my. Wish Jentorra got more screen time! Something about quantumania felt very Star Wars to me (which i loved) and honestly felt like what the Star Wars sequels should have/could have been‚Ä¶felt more star wars then the actual star wars prequels in a good way lol."
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Way too much graphic explosion... no story line.
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very weak movie script. It doesn't connect with what went before it, without a soul."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I did not know what to expect after reading some of the negative reviews. I saw it and their opinions are off base, self indulgent and obviously not Marvel people. Since not a single Marvel movie was intended to be a best movie Oscar candidate, why expect anything different with this one? Just sit back and enjoy the ride. This movie had excellent visuals, an easy to follow (yet Marvel formula plot) and solid humor. Sure Majors was great, but that added to, but did not make, the movie. I can't wait til its on Disney plus to see it again."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen!!! Great cast, awesome special effects, and great storyline!"
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Magnificent what a master piece Experience fantastic nice work totally recommended fun
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. Good story line.
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is great fun, and absolutely deserves an audience.  It keeps the sense of humour, heart and a great sense of adventure established in the original films, as well as adding a wonderfully psychedelic, futuristic, science fiction universe, that pays homage to many great science fiction movies that came before it. It also adds a much darker tone at times, which is to be expected considering the main adversary that is being contended with here. It is flawed, maybe; but no more than any other Marvel movie and far less than many. Case in point: This is absolutely superior in every way, to ""Thor,  Love and Thunder"" and ""Black Widow"", which were both hugely dissapointing and that is just 2 of the lesser Marvel productions out of a number that have been pretty poor over the last year or so, TV and cinema related.  Ignore the critics on this one .  It is far better than it is given credit for.  Go and watch it for the fun escapist entertainment that it is meant to be. It sets things up nicely for what is indicated to be coming and deserves far more positive recognition than it has been given.  Peyton Reed has done a great job here, and I just hope that the Critics opinions do not continue to put people off going to see this."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It wasn't the best Marvel movie but definitely worth the watch and opens the door to so much in the MCU
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolute junk. Worst marvel movie in a long time. All the good reviews are in denial that the mcu has now fallen off. Either marvel gets back on track or the mcu will continue on this path of derailment. 
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie, couldve done without the nods toward socialism"
"Mar 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was bad for a marvel movie but an ok movie
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,e bom.                      .
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! I went in skeptical because of the negative press. But it's becoming quite obvious that the ""professional critics"" don't know what they're talking about."
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just because of kang and not even he's that good
"Mar 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think it was a fun movie but there was major potential for it to be better
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Plot was all over the place. Jonathan Majors carried this movie. They definitely nerfed Kang and did MODOK no Justice
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,lots of action whole movie excellent
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this movie.  Yes the plot is a bit simplistic and somewhat predictable.  But the action and tight editing more than makes up for it.  I could quibble about this or that, but any movie that can keep me engrossed for 2 hrs is doing something right. And if you can, see it in real3d"
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun and fresh new Marvel movie.  People who hate on this just shouldn't watch comic book movies.
"Mar 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was flat out aweful. I actually had no intention of seeing this & the only reason I did was beacuse of Jonathan Majors.  Majors did an amazing job as Kang, but I wish he had a better movie & a better script   to supprot him"
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action throughout and love the comedy thrown in.
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Action and adventure with a good storyline! Definitely recommend!
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great start to the new phase of marvel movies. Funny but serious, great, FX and acting."
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The graphics are great and lots of action and humor.
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,A good edition to the MCU.
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"First time I laughed out loud (several times) for Marvel movie in theaters for a long while. Has the classic over-the-top humor that characterizes the past two Ant-Man movies. On top of that, the villain was played brilliantly by Jonathan Majors. I look foward to seeing more of him in action in future installments."
"Mar 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not cgi at times, but not always.  Everything  looked like it was filmed in a soundstage..."
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I love watching Marvel Movies.
"Mar 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It doesn't deserve the hate it got from the critics, it's a solid 7/10. The story was good and it was as a great introduction to Kang and made me look forward to seeing more from him."
"Mar 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a little concerning that there is, a somewhat drop in the quality of the output of the MCU.  Maybe you can assign that to increased quantity when you throw in the Disney+ shows.  Personally, Thor L&T is the only movie I can call terrible, while Wakanda & Eternals left me somewhat disappointed.

Having said that, IMHO, I don't believe that Quantumania deserves all of the criticism it has gotten. I've got more of an issue with some rather large plot holes vice the character interaction.  It does seem like some parts of the script are forced.  And I do see how if you didn't watch ""Loki"" you might be a little lost as to ""Who the heck is this guy"" in the sense you miss Kang's intro to the MCU.  

The CGI is a little overwhelming at times, sometimes it makes the action hard to follow.  But it's a good and enjoyable movie, and the humor/action ratio is right where it needs to be for MCU, which has made this overall franchise so successful.

I just hope that Guardians 3 is much better than how the Guardians were portrayed in L&T.  That was just awful.  Taika Waititi shouldn't be allowed to direct any more MCU movies."
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"FAR better than the critics are saying.  Ignore them.   It's not ""the best"" of Marvel, I'd agree.  AND if you put this film in the larger context of the MultiVerse saga....if you really look at the details of Loki, What If, Shang Chi, The Eternals, Ms Marvel, etc....at how all these films are being weaved together, Quantumania is a home run!  There is A LOT to this movie if you're really paying attention."
"Mar 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The lowest of them all, bad plot, bad dialog, the wasp was there for 1 scene the rest of the movie without her was the same, the mother is cringe and hatefull to see the entire movie and the background always CGI is just headhachs waiting to happen. Please stop with the M-SHE-U and get back to good stories and not so bad CGI"
"Mar 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not what I expected.  Felt a little contrived and stale.
"Mar 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I used to be a die-hard fan of the MCU and had high hopes that this would be the movie that reignited that interest. 

It wasn't.

Quantumania's story is horrific and illogical. The jokes are tired. The characters are seriously unlikeable (I think Paul Rudd's charisma is the only thing that vaguely saves the bloated cast - I feel for Evangeline Lilly who has been shafted). Some of the worst CGI I've seen in years (spare a thought for the poor artists forced to do this). The music is bland. 

Kang is supposed to be the next Thanos-level ""big bad."" Jonathan Majors is a phenomenal actor, but this attempt at a fan favourite is particularly limp. 

I'm just not convinced there's any coming back from this mess. Phase 4 has thrown the franchise off the rails, and if Antman is anything to go by, Phase 5 is beginning to plummet into the abyss."
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"A really good movie. Definitely the best Ant-Man movie to date.
I really don't know what movie the critics saw honestly.
I wish they had spent more time with the native rebels of the quantum realm. I really didn't mind the simple plot of the movie and this Kang is definitely not dead.
The post credit scenes were absolutely awesome especially the second one.
A solid start to Phase 5."
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"//Spoil Alert In This Review


The movie ""Ant-Man"" is one movie of the franchise marvel cinematic universe that has always been popular among movie fans both marvel fans and non-marvel fans, there are many sequels of Ant-Man starting with ""Ant-Man"" in 2015, ""Ant-Man And The Wasp"" in 2018, and the last one is ""Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania in 2023"" which while I am reviewing this movie, this movie is still showing in the cinema.

In the beginning, the movie starts with Scott Lang (known as Ant-Man), who walks into the city with his headphones. After he saves the world in the Avengers: Endgame war by eliminating Thanos, he comes back to have a daily life like other people. But one day, his daughter ""Cassie Lang"" invented something that can send a signal to the quantum universe, after her mother knew that, she said to shut it off immediately but it was too late, everyone in the room sucked and was stuck in the quantum universe. This is very surprising to me because I hope they can shut it off before terrible situations happen. When Ant-Man and her daughter arrive and wake up, both need to wear ant-main suits to fight with monsters attacking them. In this scene, I think it is really exciting that the animation expands and shrinks the ant-man suits and ambiance of the scene which is attractively decorated and enormous. They need to survive in the quantum universe where many aliens and monsters are dangerous and can be harmful to them, and it is called a secret universe because no one has a piece of info about this universe. However, both got caught by some tribe and ask why they coming here, both said it was an accident and explain several reasons, hence, the tribe decides to let them go because they are not enemies but the thing that I shock while watching is mucus translate that both need to drink it to understand what they said and able to communicate with them. After that, both need to find the remaining people of their family that got stuck in this universe too, so both ask the head of the tribe, do you know or found them or not? They weren't found and might have been caught by Kang who governed this universe. Suddenly, this tribe was attacked by Kang Armies, it is so unfortunate. I also called this to be trouble for the tribe because if both of them don't visit here, Kang Armies won't attack them in my opinion, after they caught and rescued both ant-man and Cassie. The war is continuous and finally ends up with the tribe losing and all of them including both ant-man and cassie got caught in Kang's jail in his building, after both wake up, Kang comes to talk by himself and forces ant-man to find the engine core for his warp spaceship to another universe if he doesn't do, Kang will kill Cassie. So at this point, from my perspective, ant-man has no choice apart from grabbing the engine core that Kang wants to trade with his daughter's life. While ant-man deep into a probability storm and grabs the engine core, all of the remaining people of the family come here to help Ant-Man and his daughter from Kang. In my opinion, Ant-Man's feelings change from hopeless to hopeful when they come. Nevertheless, Cassie got caught and moved into Kang's jail before her family came to help. After that, Ant-Man and her family assemble with the tribe that has helped them before to attack Kang's cantonment to restrain Kang's spaceship to other universes and help Cassie. I can't take my eyes off this scene and the moment, it is perfect in terms of sound, plot, story, and animation. In the end, Ant-Man and his armies destroy Kang's armies and liberate people who got caught, and then, Ant-Man and his family return to the universe where they came from.
In conclusion, I suggest everyone watch this movie on their own (Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania), it contains all of the moments and feelings for the whole time you watch it, in terms of animation, plot story, scenes, and characteristics of the actor. If you are a marvel movie fan, you can't miss this by the way. I will give 9.5 out of 10 scores, there are a few deducted scores for the reason that there is some unreasonable scene that I think is a bit weird nevertheless overall the plot story is close to perfect word."
"Mar 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,The storyline was just not intriguing whatsoever! The best part of the movie was Jonathan Majors; hands down. Phenomenal acting but from beginning to end it was hard to stay connected to this particular story. Still hopeful for more Marvel movies to come
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania is one of my best solo movies for Marvel Cinematic Universe that make the feelings on how put nearly everything together in this movie to look ""epic"" for some reason in the style of Peyton Reeds, who is the director of the movie. The story is about how Scott and Cassie Lang, accompanied with Pym's Family, accidentally deep down into quantum dimension, and need to find the way out in reality realm. During the way to find out, they needed to face with the conqueror like Kang, who wants to have a power to manage every timeline. And also, we have seen M.O.D.O.K. in movie style for the first time.

The production was set up, or directed by Peyton Reeds, and writing by Jeff Loveness. In beginning and the final part of the movie was located on San Francesco with beautiful sunshine day, which is really good location and time to share on Scott Lang's happy moments with his people around him to express on what he did once for saving the universe with Avengers. Also, there would be a lot of scenes that take on Quantum Realm where they were using on their lots of visual effects on nearly entire movies, but I would like to recommend that it will very worthy when we would like to watch with IMAX-3D with laser system.

Furthermore, I would like to say that I really love the movie much, but not hype enough like Avengers: Endgame, though I had seen the big scale of the battalion of ants coming through the quantum realm. But I would consider that this scene is very hype enough to opening the fifth phase of MCU, and worth to wait to see this movie for some reasons, like how Marvel Studios shows us the way they enter the fifth phase of the universe, with fighting the ""Avengers-level threat"" like Kang the Conqueror on this solo movie. Additionally, we would see the development on their changes of four main characters like Scott Lang, who is played by Paul Rudd, on Ant-Man responsibilities and being a father to Cassie Lang, Hope Van Dyne, played by Evangeline Lilly, on The Wasp responsibilities to care the family and the one (Scott) who loves, Cassie herself, played by Kathryn Newton, for her teenage roles and responsibilities to save the world with his father, and Janet Van Dyne, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, have some secrets those didn't tell yet to the family when she was stuck in Quantum Realm.

Additionally, I would add more that the director is excellent on expressing his quantum realm upon Science and his imagination on it. With all these, he came up for designing the appearances, the costumes, and many more to be like living in the quantum, the smallest place that we cannot see it. And then, he visualizes with effects to be more realistic on it. If I compare with the other movies, this one would be one of the best showing off Science movies, which is really like Christopher Nolan's. On music and soundtrack part, they invited Christopher Beck to compose the movie soundtrack, and it's literally thrills with the power of orchestra and modernized symphony, which is absolutely matched together on his way.

Lastly, I would like to say that this movie quite an average good score, but not high much as Avengers did. Although, it could make our mimic that this movie is really excellent opening for Phase 5 of The Marvel Cinematic Universe. And I would like to say that it is worth to see it for this moment."
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it. I‚Äôm not sure what the hate is all about. Solid movie, good cast, great villain, all around entertaining"
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,It's was loads of fun!! Could definitely watch it again!
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good CGI, the end is kind of anticlimax"
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good to see Wreck it Ralph and Star Wars have their scripts and CGI be able to be used again.
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,i loved the movie a lot cuz  there was a huge plot twist at the end and it was very funny.
"Mar 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"its a decent movie , with ok writing and even tho its not the one of the best movies of the mcu . its still got something that makes it somewhat good , i would say that the start is good , the middle is ok and at the end its probably the best part , kang was wasted but still a good character , i would say that scott lang would be the best character in the movie well of course his the main character . but still tho i think i rank this movie a 6.2/10"
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and intensive. Must see! Loved Paul Pudd as always!
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, people that don't like should write and direct there own version."
"Mar 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm glad I watched it, but I happily never will again. One of marvels worst imo."
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,They stretch the movie too long
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,It had a lot of action and great story. I really enjoyed watching it with my grandson.  And we loved that the ending hinted at even more.
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely thrilling! No clue how it could get poor reviews.
"Mar 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Kinda fresh and kinda derivative at the same time. Cool for marvel to go waaaay into anew direction for this phase, but it also felt like one of the first 3 Star Wars movies for about an hour.  Overall Im gonna keep coming back but this ones a nah"
"Mar 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was like a poor quality Rick and Morty episode, but for 9 year olds instead of edgy teenagers.  The worst of every aspect of Marvel movies shoved into one movie.  ""Brilliant"" characters with zero common sense, teenagers creating state of the art technology, oversaturated CGI, terrible humor, zero stakes for any main character. 

Johnathan Majors was good as Kang, but he couldn't save such a terrible script.  Worst Marvel movie so far, which says a lot after how bad Love and Thunder and Wakanda Forever were."
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the movie. Great effects and Johnathan majors killed it with his character Kang.
"Mar 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Almost thought I was watching a Star Wars spin off, but with subpar characters and a terrible script / plot."
"Mar 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a good theater and movie was good but reminding me so much of Star Wars.
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, exciting, and cant wait for the next adventure!"
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I continue to be surprised by Ant-Man.  Thought film had good action.  Kang and Modok are good villains.  If you didn't watch Loki on Disney+, you should before seeing this film.  Ant Man is in the middle of Quantumania."
"Mar 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,What a stinker! Building Kang up to be a menace and then gets defeated by ants and a goofy MODOK with the most undeserved Characterdevelopment ive ever seen. I only loughed once during this movie and that was to make fun of MODOKs design.
"Mar 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A poorly written, badly directed movie held together only by the vain attempts of the cast to bring some little slice of the charm of the first two Ant-movies to this bloated, tedious spectacle.

Jeff Loveness should never be allowed near a script again. His dialogue was anemic at best, and insipid at best. The forced ""Let's do Marvel Star Wars"" aspect was awful... I mean... rebels, troopers, a cantina scene... even a detention level? There is nothing remotely original or intriguing about the movie, and even Paul Rudd's charm, nor Jonathan Majors' charisma could save this mess. 

Simplistic garbage, lacking all the small scale caper charm of the first two... and a complete waste of Cassie and Hope... tonally inconsistent... just bad all the way around."
"Mar 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst film ever in MCU and MODOK is the worst caracter ever.
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was so entertaining! I admit that I did not really want to see it, but I went with my superfan son, and it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time! Made me laugh SO many times! Paul Rudd is quickly endearing me to him. Michael Douglas is such a national treasure, and I loved seeing him stretch his acting chops more. I was very glad that Michelle Pfeiffer's role was greatly expanded, so she could have fun with the role. The only complaint is that the movie had so many interesting characters, all of whom could have had their own movie, and not one of them gets more than fifteen minutes of screen time. Other than that, I am excited to see what comes next!
SPOILER ALERT Bill Murray's character, as well as the mind-reader, should have gotten at least triple the screen time, and MODOK, while a hoot, was rather unsettling to look at. And I wish they hadn't ended him when there's so much comic lore to draw from. But I about leapt out of my seat with pure glee at the sight of the two greatest characters put to screen (Loki and Mobius) making a long-awaited comeback!"
"Mar 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ant-man and the Wasp Quantumania is a funny movie but at the same a bit of a mess. Kang is definitely the best character of this movie and I am so excited for more of him. Jonathan majors is great! I would recommend it if you like comedy in the MCU and don't mind a messy plot overall.
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action, good storyline and just the right amount of humor!"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really Love the action and the funny parts were Awesome, I would watch this movie over and over!"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was a Great Movie with Understanding and Trust in The Most Unconditional Forms ""Love"" with People's Best Interest at Heart is The Key as Say Cheers"
"Mar 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"TERRIBLE MOVIE. Underwhelming, unbelievable and just plain boring. I'm getting fed up with frenzied marvel freaks giving bad movies fake rave reviews."
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,I was really excited for this movie and I didnt want to keep my hopes up so I didnt. I saw it the day it came out and I would say it was good. There was some moments where it kinda didn't make sense. I would say its a movie you would want to watch one time and never see it again.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun wild ride from start to credits and post credits. Paul Rudd is stellar as usual, finding the balance of comedy and action hero.  Majors gives an incredible performance that digs deep into the nuances of ""what if"" a being could control time, they would be all-knowing and our relationship to them would essentially be like us to chickens - is he a villain or are we collateral damage of a larger plan?"
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Depende do seu olhar e expectativa, pois ele √© mais uma com√©dia de sessao da tarde do Homem Formiga pra passar o tempo, mas n√£o atendeu as expectativas de ningu√©m, pois era pra ser um filme grandioso que a Marvel n√£o soube fazer, a grande n√£o trabalhada introdu√ß√£o do Kang! Que o que salva o filme √© a atua√ß√£o do Jonathan Majors e a Michelle Pheiffer e as duas maravilhosas cenas p√≥s cr√©ditos"
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While feeling more like a set-up film for what's to come in the MCU and with inclusions all over the place that feel a bit unnecessary, Jonathan Majors smashes it as Kang and there's plenty still good about this film for it to be solid and enjoyable"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a solid movie with some great acting. It feels a bit like Age of Ultron, where it's more connective tissue for other events and movies, but it was a fun ride in itself and sets up the next phase. It's a lot different than the first two Antman movies, but a lot has happened in between Antman 2 and 3."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!  Loved it!
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,Nice palette cleanser and bridge to The Multiverse Saga. Good set up to next Avengers movie.
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,Writing is not as great as the original ant man. But still a fun story with the kids. 
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Paul Rudd will forever be one of the funniest MCU superheroes
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely refreshing!  Ho Marvel Movies!  Will watch it again and again!
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, entertaining, and a good story."
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,overall decent movie dragged on a little at the end. Paul rudd was great like always
"Mar 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One hour into the movie and my son and i still weren't interested,  or captured in any way. We chose to leave after one hour and ten minutes of movie time."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it very much.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was fun and enjoyable. It was a lovely super-hero movie. Told its own story, while giving interesting backstory while also setting up the future story.
That is a lot of heavy lifting for any one movie, but it did it well while also looking pretty."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked how they went back into the quantum realm and showed people live there. Not much I didn't like
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie. No idea what all the criticism is about. Good action and effects, humor was great. Would see it again."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,We loved it!! Very action filled movie!! Would watch it again!!
"Mar 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie wasn't the greatest movie of them all it still checked off a few boxes. The storyline was everywhere and I didn't think it added up at all. There wasn't enough person moments in the movie and it was all action the entire time. One thing that angered me was that they didn't keep Cassidy as the same actor in the previous movies but it makes sense because the blip had happened. I would recommend this to someone trying to pass time.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was pretty good but I didn't like it as much as the other Ant Man movies.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Great continuation of the Kang story started in the Loki series. Jonathan Majors is the perfect strong terrifying villain in the midst of the chaos. Kang is the next Thanos level villain, and I'm here for it."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Visually stunning. Amazing performances. Epic story. Definitely a huge Marvel film with lots of humor and fun.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Plot was definitely a bit of a mess and it wasn't as comedic as the other movies, but it was extremely enjoyable nonetheless. It definitely makes your wonder what'll play out in the next movies to come!"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Special effects were amazing, good action and funny."
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too much going on, i felt a bit lost or overwhelmed, but it had its funny parts"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked this movie I recommend going to see it
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"May not be one of the top ones but definitely a great watch.
Visuals were lovely."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Firstly; OMG! I love how the ""professionals"" have no idea what they have experienced?! It's almost like they have been watching a whole other movie? When they are rating Thor Love and Thunder, and She-Hulk higher than this movie, then they all have to reconsider their profession, cause this movie was FIRE. Both the plot and the CGI/VFX was so much better, than where they have been the last couple of months... well the last year. 

The start of this movie had a really great way of establishing the vibe that we got from the first Ant-Man movie, where we have a ""down-to-the-ground"" hero like Scott Lang (Paul Rudd). It also introduced the core driving force that our main protagonist Ant-Man will have during this movie; the urge to keep his daughter Cassie Lang safe. 

The actors were solid in their performances, with Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and Jonathan Majors's Kang The Conquerer, being what carried the movie. I could not wrap my head around the recasted Cassie Lang, but some people likes the change, others did not. We have to live with it, as this character is most likely to pop up in a future Young-Avengers movie. 

(SPOILERS)

Back to the plot; how they slowly introduced us to the fear Janet had to someone in the Quantum Realm, was a smart way of making her more mystical and interesting.  Like she had something to hide. They also used the blip in a great way, as (technically) Scott Lang, and most of the characters in this movie (exception; Cassie Lang) had been blipped away for five years, whilst Cassie had been reading about and experimented with the Quantum Realm (without Janet's supervision, as she was blipped). I did not like Janet in the previous movies, but here, she was there for a reason, and that is why the movie works. Finally, the""producers"" have done some proper character development with Janet, that impacts the movie greater than what she normally does. 

The way they build up to Kang the Conquerer throughout the movie, but not properly revealing him before the late second/early third act is geniously done. We had to see some of him, but considering the fact that he is the new Thanos, it might be smart to keep some questions about the character for the audience to pounder. We have established that he is indeed powerful, and his driving force, as opposed to Thanos, is to conquer, and not to ""save"" the people, which can lead to many interesting storylines, culminating with either Avengers: The Kang Dynasty or Avengers: Secret Wars. 

Although, during most of the movie, several creatures and characters in the Quantum Realm, the MODOK creation, etc. could be compared to Star Wars. I asked the friend i was watching the movie with, and he totally agreed, mentioning several points to prove my statement. 

It is also worth mentioning that most of this movie was shot in front of a green screen. Many characters had been computer generated, and all shots had a ton of CGI and VFX. Nontheless, I think that the movie still works quite well, and what the CGI artists have created is a masterpiece (one exception; camera angle when MODOK is on-screen).

The ending of the movie is also good, but many questioned how easily Scott Lang escaped after the portal was broken down. Cassie simply opened a portal and they walked through... Ant-Man is definitely onto something, as he is walking thorugh the streets, just like he did during the start of the movie (good circle-composition), only this time; something is off! He is seeing a lot of people wearing green and purple colors everywhere (colors of Kang the Conquerer), and most of them are walking past Scott several times, like if either them or Scott Lang is in some sort of time-loop. Is something happening in the ""background"" that has not been revealed yet? Probably... Maybe we get more answers in Loki Season 2. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was a great start to Phase 5, and a step up from where Marvel has been since the ending of WandaVision and Loki (which were two great shows). Now, I can't wait for more genius writing and awesome projects from Marvel Studios!"
"Mar 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad directing, bad storytelling, bland acting, poorly developed plot."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the movie. Ant-Man is one of my favourites characters of the Marvel universe and I went expecting his cute goofiness and sense of humour and it was still there. Of course is not a perfect movie. I wouldn't add characters that look human is you want to create a new universe like the quantum realm. Please paint their skin in colours? like in guardians of the galaxy so I can actually believe characters are in another realm. 
The humour was really good, the addition  of a new villain really cracked me up. You will get this when you see the movie. 
Also, Kang is a very impressive villain, I'm really looking forward to what's coming with him on the Marvel universe.  
I really dont understand all the hate for the movie. Lately critics expect to see masterpieces at the movies. Sometimes they forget people just want to be entertained and get distracted from reality. Which is why I still enjoy watching Marvel movies. Anhway, I do recommend the movie as a family friendly movie that will keep you entertained."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Liked so many things about this movie, including that it wasn't predictable. Some good laughs and so much cool new imagery in this new dimension. It had the heart of any Ant-man movie, and I will always love Scott Lang's sensibility as a person and dad. Definitely a great ride. Oh, and Jonathan Major's subtle yet commanding performance as Kang was excellent. It had a Shakespearean vibe. I could watch him all day."
"Mar 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,(SPOILER FREE) I think that the movie was not that good although Johnathan majors did a magnificent job in this movie. I love Kang now.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a great ""trilogy-capper"". I'm an old guy, with ""old eyes"" üòÅ, so I'm probably not going to pick up all the perceived ""defects"" in the CGI that I keep reading that many are complaining about. I just don't see it. 

I think that EVERY character shined, especially Michelle Pfeiffer chewing the scenery, and Michael Douglas getting a heroic turn, as well. Yes, it's supposed to be, and should be, about Scott and Hope, but I'm kinda glad that everyone had equal parts to play. Even Cassie had her ""coming out"" moments, because she will surely be featured in upcoming installments, to go along with Kamala, and America, among others. 

I think the only thing I disagree with, is the hype for Jonathan Majors, as Kang. The critics are blowing this guy up, as the next Poitier. I'm not seeing it; not from this role, honestly. Maybe he's great in Lovecraft Country, or other roles. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Don't get me wrong; he was good, and intimidating, but I found T'challa (Boseman - R.I.P.) and Killmonger (Jordan), far more dynamic, on the screen (Black Panther). We're going to get A LOT more Majors, from here on out, so let's see what he does. 

I think that this movie, in later years, will receive much more appreciation, than it's getting, now. I watched Ant-Man and the Wasp a week before AM3, just to refresh my memory, because I have it on Digital, and I forgot how GOOD it was!"
"Mar 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another Paint by numbers marvel flick that checks all the boxes. 

Doesn't provide anything new or ground breaking story wise. 

Wastes yet another villain needlessly just to get recognition and a few cheap laughs. 

Main villain could be interesting if flushed out more in future installments. 

Cheap laughs and repetitive jokes that seem desperate or lazy. 

Story drags and writing isn't up to par."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,saw it for the 3rd time this time in 3D....gets better every time....
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Imaginative and wild, epic but a little too plotcentric outside of a terrific menacing Kang and a little cringe (MODOK) keeps it from being among the best of the best ... very captivating and interesting all the same ..."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a great movie great comedy!
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Heard it wasn't that good but I'm glad I didn't listen.  I thought the movie was great, and can't wait to see what's next!"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,We really enjoyed this movie.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors is great. Missed Michael Pe√±a's character (Luiz). 
Can't wait to see the next film."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"(SPOILER WARNING) See,I don't get why people hate this movie because for me it was the BEST movie ever, it has comedy, suspense, action, and a bit of drama. The movie takes place in the quantum realm witch iv'e always wanted to happen. Ant-man's suit Is INSANELY COOL.If you are a girl the Wasp's suit also got upgraded so that is something else to enjoy.
In conclusion the movie is awesome the villain is great and the plot and characters are perfect EVERYTHING in this movie is perfect!! so, all in all you should DEFINITELY watch this. If you have a kid over 10 I highly recommend this movie!!"
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I can't believe that Marvel would bring up sustainability, etc. in this movie after being shredded at the box office for the last several movies to include Disney movies."
"Mar 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel has lost its magic. Its a mere shadow of what it was. Cliche lines and stupid corny jokes everywhere with no real consequences to the overall arc. Maybe its time for Disney to hire Jon Favreau back into the MCU to teach them how to run this thing.

Weak plot
Weak characters
Weak mid credit and post credit scenes"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent and exciting movie!
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie had some good things, but it was mostly carried by Kang"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Family movie. Good writing, editing and screenplay . Love the story where the whole Ant-Man family is involved. Some funny moments. Ant-Man is a regular guy character one can relate to. If you are having second thoughts don't , go watch it."
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked it.  I honestly didn't expect to, hearing all the negative reviews on YouTube and such... but going into it, I started to realize, that negative reviews probably make better content for those YouTubers, so there is motivation there.

Anyway, all the major characters had decent character arcs, though Scott and Janet got the bulk of the story, with Cassie, Hank and Hope as secondary players, and of course Kang, who is a really descent villain who I'm intrigued by.  It's worth checking out."
"Mar 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,I fell asleep halfway through.
"Mar 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cringey humor, amazing villain wasted, modos was barf"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a sucker for Ant-Man, maybe I just love Marvel, but this has been the best Marvel release since the pandemic. Fun, funny, great time!"
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania might not have been the biggest Marvelverse story, but as a friend once said, size matters not. It was entertaining & visually impressive."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Great graphics. The actors were great.   The jokes were funny.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10 but if any parent wants to see it obviously don‚Äôt bring your kids
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,movie was great can't wait to see more of Kane
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Really loved it and cant wait to watch it at home on regular tv
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another fun instalment of the Antman franchise, is it high art ? no but ignore  all the haters , it's a fun family movie , we almost didn't go because of the mediocre reviews , glad we ignored them !"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it. I've heard bad things about it but I actually enjoyed it. Story was consistent, and it didn't felt like it was jumping around. It tied in with the previous Ant-Man movies so it had continuation. I'll give it an 8 out if 10."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"People are crazy this movie is awesome! Avengers level quality.

As good as Avatar WOTW if not better.

I should have watched it in 3D"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great continuation of the Ant-Man movies!  It was fun and enjoyable.  One of my favorite Phase 4 movies alongside Spider-Man: No Way Home and Wakanda Forever.  I really enjoyed the performance of all the actors.  Looking forward to more Kang variants in the future.  (although, hoping they don't over do it, don't want Kang in too many movies).  Great movie.  Don't believe the critics, it was very good."
"Mar 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,Poor attempt to impress viewers with wild collection of creatures and special effects. Mediocre acting plus stupid jokes made us to walk out in 20 minutes.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Personally thought it was the best of the three Ant-Man films. I went into this film with lower expectations given my previous experience with the Phase 4 films. My brother and I left the theatre very pleased and both said that this film is worth a rewatch. If you're a Marvel fan, you'll enjoy the film. Definitely worth the watch!"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Great way to introduce Kang! It was funny and visually great!
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Great family movie special effects must see
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"MCU still delivers, but I'm more of a fan of the first two. Its missing the quirkiness and fun of Luis and the small comedy jabs of the previous two installments. Still a good addition. Slightly misses the mark."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Gets more into the multiverse it was cool to see with my son
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,A movie best enjoyed if you leave your brain in the car before entering the theater. Script thin as single ply toilet paper and so full of holes it makes Swiss cheese jealous.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is amazing movie, is one of my favorite movies."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Favorite entry in the Antman series to date. Look forward to watching again on streaming. Doesn't break out of the Marvel mold much but is enjoyable
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely love the storyline, funny and action packed. The actor who plays the villan is an awesome actor."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun movie! Personally, I didn't think it was as entertaining as the first two installments, but I could tell it was setting up another pathway of Multi-verse action and after I watched the two post-credits teasers, I knew I was right. Definitely worth a watch for Marvel fans."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie! Love the quantum realm.
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was pretty good 7.5 out of 10
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not very good.  I have seen the first two several times and they are very good.  it was to weird, not enough action.  Only the villain was awesome."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It was full of action.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good Ant-Man movie!!!
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Probably one of the worst marvel movies I‚Äôve see 
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critical consensus  is wrong. ""Quantumania"" passes what I call the ""next day test"", i.e. it's full of characters and moments that stay in my mind, and it takes me to a place I'd like to see much more of and to see again. The visuals are gorgeous, the Quantum Realm is fascinating and convincing, the plot makes sense, the family relationships are real and funny, and the fate of Darren Cross (""M.O.D.O.K."") is hysterical - one of the most bizarre, and strangely moving, visual creations I've ever seen. And Kang, Jonathan Majors, a version of whom was already intro'd in ""Loki"", is the best new villain in time, space and the Multiverses. So whatever weird forces are at work in the critic-verse on earth...ignore them. Enjoy the movie."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I just wasn't as funny throughout as Marvel movies usually are. I would have liked to see more of those funny characters, like the guy who wanted holes."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a movie here to entertain. It did. Left you waiting for the next set.  I'm ready for them
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and great animation!
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a thrill ride from beginning to end.
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Una pel√≠cula que carece de emoci√≥n, no se siente como una pel√≠cula de superh√©roes. Muchos errores. Efectos especiales detestables. El mensaje es muy dif√≠cil de entender. Guion p√©simo.  Lo √∫nico rescatable es la gran actuaci√≥n de Jhonatan Majors."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very fun, exciting and entertaining. The acting was great. I especially enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer, Paul Rudd and Jonathon Majors. I guess some of the CGI was not up to some people's expectation, but in context of the rest of the movie, I didn't mind."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,To weird special effects were over the top the fun banner that the characters had in the first two werent there. This one wasnt my favorite ant-man
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Really good MCU movie. It's a good beginning to Marvel's Phase 5. Looking forward to see how they incorporate Kang into other MCU movies until the big payoff in Kang Dynasty. The Kang character is Thanos to the Nth degree as he wants to eliminate entire timelines instead of half the universe. This movie drags a bit at times and doesn't have the funny/quirkly flow of the previous Ant-Man movies. But I'm a big MCU fan and am happy with the result!
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,very fun movie great watch
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even though I got a few Star Wars vibes throughout the movie, it didn't disappoint in entertaining me. A good mix of the Marvel tune, serious mixed with witty comments and a dash of self-aware cringe. Definitely has me interested in what's to come."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this! It was the most 'comic book' movie Marvel has done yet and I was fascinated by the creatures in the Quantum realm. Some good funny moments. I am not sure why this is getting a lot of negative reviews as it is comparable to most Marvel movies.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Best one so far! Don‚Äôt listen to the reviews
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely love Antman. He's the best character hands down. Paul Rudd is a spectacle. The amazing universe they created was awe inspiring to my kids and I.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I was pleasantly surprised
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,it was a great movie I love all the Marvel movies so I am biased I really enjoyed it looking forward to the next Avengers installment
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,I thought the visuals were good. The grandparents were annoying. Still not a bad marvel movie overall.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It was your standard fun colorful Marvel flick. Villain was excellent
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Other than Kang, the movie felt very unnecessary. Cheese factor is agressive in this. Its like a 12-year olds fantasy of finally getting to curse for the first time and just saying dick over and over. It was fine, but I wouldnt really wanna watch it again."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-man 3 left me without any words (in the wrong way). It proves that Marvel isn't the same anymore. All the characters are pure cartoons. They are only caring about making jokes and jokes. Peyton Reed made Hank Pym (my favorite character) a joke. All the characters in this story are forgettable, because they all have the same personality which consists in making jokes and laughing all the time. Finally, the whole movie is a bad excuse to present Kang. It is definitely the worst MCU film of all time. Final score: 2,5/10"
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. If you come to enjoy a movie you will be satisfied.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story. Stunning visuals. Not perfect but a damn good watch.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The review to wait for is by the professional CGI crew at VFXguide.com. 
In the meantime I found QMania better than I expected.  To me John Majors does NOT seem like hes in a different Shakespeare movie.  He does seem like the most believable person where everyone else is in Your Average Super Hero Effort. 

I believe QMania has the same problem many creative but low-grossing sci-fi fantasy films have. Audience sophistication is over-estimated. It plays like it was made for an audience of CGI professionals, NOT a mass audience.  ""...writer Jeff Loveness, is making up the rules as it goes along, which is why ""Quantumania"" whisks you through its visually zapping action without generating any real investment in it"" ~ Owen Gleiberman in Variety

Compare with Way of Water.  Avatar 2's heroic and cerebral gags never overshadow its characters and audiences can ride on the solid emotional thru line even if it's predictable. By contrast, Quantumania appears to be for professionals whose idea of fun is Siggraph conference presentations."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good, made Cassie into an annoying character. Start of the story made no sense‚Ä¶but overall bit of a nice change to generic marvel"
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie and has its funny moments. If you like Marvel, this is a top option to see."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow my review seems inappropriate once I read all the adult film buffs reviews. I dont know why people like them watch a movie that is so far below them? They obviously dont get it. Its fun. Its meant to be fun. Excellent story line and acting! It was new. The quantum realm has not been explored this way in film before. I mean where else can we go everything has been done and said so now were into remakes and extending series of things already created. This movie was a step in another direction that was creative and directed at the whole family. Actors and storyline for me and stunningly beautiful visuals and characters for the kids. I would see it again.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I felt like this was a good quality marvel movie.  The last couple movies after endgame really ruined the marvel name but this gave me some hope for the future of marvel again.  It was funny, entertaining, and Jonathan Majors plays the perfect roll for kang.  He is a worthy succesor to Thanos."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Least favorite installment
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,a weird but fun star wars movie . yep i know this anty man but it really made think star wars . while not perfect i enjoyed this one for the most part . yeah some the humor was a bit cringy and some the things did not land and i once say its fun weird popcorn star wars movie
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel should be embarrassed for releasing this in the theatres. No tactile storyline, no character arc, just an empty 125 minute trailer made for the sake of introducing Kang into the MCU. Jonathan Majors is a great actor, but all his charisma couldn't inflate such a shoddily written character. Marvel's quality control seems to have vanished into the quantum realm, like Scott pre-Endgame. This is incompetent filmmaking, given the budget they were working with."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"At first when I was watching this I didn't really understand all the negative reviews. Yeah, a lot of the jokes didn't really land (which is weird for an Ant-Man movie). But  it was better than the worst of Marvel's movies like Eternals and Thor: Love and Thunder.

Then it got to the ending and it just... didn't make any sense. I was confused and wondering if I missed something. I went and looked it up later and no, it turns out I didn't miss anything. The ending, in fact, doesn't make any sense. It was also re-shot a month before release. Apparently someone at Marvel felt this non-sensical, contrived ending was better than what they had before. But for me, it completely ruined what was up to that point an ok movie.

Also, the first two Ant-Man movies, Infinity War, Endgame, and the first season of Loki are basically required viewing before watching this - otherwise you'll probably be completely lost on what's happening."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania was Awesome. Another view into the Quantum realm !
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I would rate this film 9/10 if it wasn't for the writer intentionally screwing up MODOK's character and not making it like the comics. Since the writer is a troll and did not stick to the source material, i have to give this 2/5 stars. It's offensive for a writer to make a Jar Jar Binks character on purpose rather than make a serious character that looks like the comics instead of bad CGI."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great beautiful theater! Great movie!
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I personally loved the movie and  Jonathan Majors as Kang was fantastic!  as we're all of the other actors!!  I love of Paul Rudd and especially his portrayal of Ant Man, and to see Michelle Pieffer is always a bonus!  The Quantumania  realm is now one of my favoritesüêô"
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"4/10. The definition of emptiness that the MCU has been pumping out for the last few years. Kang was very good but for what? So many possibilities with the quantum realm gone down the drain. From a very authentic hero from the previous two Ant-Man movies we get (for whatever reason) this digi-mess. Ant-Man is a decent movie on the surface, but so empty on the inside. But hey. If you enjoy decent movie with decent jokes and decent story, Quantumania is for you. However I'm afraid that MCU is slowly (but surely) dying out."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Antman to date. Scott lang is treated like a respected person who has grown as a character. No more making Scott the idiot of the group who only good is to steal. He is the leader in this movie. This movie is for people who are currently following Marvel. This means if you haven't seen Loki Season 1 then you have no reason to watch this movie. This version of Kang is not the strongest version we will see; this is only a preview of what is to come. The one thing I will say is that Marvel will not die while Johnathan Majors and Tom Hiddleston are in it.
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just average Marvel movie. Like the characters for the most part pot the plot was nothing great.
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,I like the movie yes there was a few ups and downs but its overhated and underrated the dialogue was ok and decent for my liking but I enjoyed it
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's everything you want from an MCU film. A great plot, great acting, great special effects, and it furthers the MCU. This film felt like a launching point for the next phase of the MCU in all the best ways. An epic adventure that was a lot of fun to go on. I would recommend it, but you know you're going to see it anyway."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania.

Includes loads of new characters from the Quantum realm that none of us care about but Disney can sell them all as toys, so that's OK.

Animals and creatures that offer absolutely nothing other than ""Star Wars-esque"" comic relief and $$$'s for toys.

Paul Rudd as Ant-man is cool as always.

Kang is great, but he's not in it for long enough and he's not as powerful as he is made out.  There is no real show of his power or potential.

The flying manta ray is a totally unnecessary mode of travel.

The movie is basically a massive soulless green-screen CGI fest used to introduce...and then get rid of Kang.

The Quantum realm is both bizarre and completely unnecessary.

Marvel SERIOUSLY need to go back to the drawing board.  Maybe rewatch The Winter Solider or Civil War and see how the more ""Grounded"" Marvel movies give so much more substance than the empty soulless CGI-infested rubbish that has been churned out recently.

Quantumania is a slight improvement, but Marvel SERIOUSLY needs to go back to the drawing board to make quality over quantity.

I'd give Quantumania 6/10"
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't love the movie, never been a big antman fan, but it is the best out of the 3 antman films and Kang was awesome."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the unique world portrayed in the movie. 
Hated the bad guy. Dont want to see him or the actor again. Didnt like that Bill Murray has such a small role"
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,i thought it was incredible. the plot is good its just individualised because its only about the 5 main characters. it still has the jokes and the laughs. the only negative thing is that luis isnt in the film :(

"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic acting from the classic crew, with the expected comedic relief of Paul Rudd. Beautifully animated throughout."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,My husband and my son really enjoyed the movie!
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly a really good movie and the best ant man movie out of all of them very good to continue the storyline
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Actually It was a fun movie. Sure, it was not perfect, but I think It was Better then the most of phase 4 MCU movies. Looking forward to see more about Kang."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hands down the best marvel movie, in terms of visual effects. The story is a little rushed at the beginning, but the overall story is great. Considering the pretty weak showing Marvel has had in the last couple years, I think this was a pretty strong step in the right direction to get them back to where they used to be before Endgame."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie lots of action
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,CGI was not to the standard I expect from a high budget Marvel movie.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Going into the movie with the mindset of it's not a major character, such as ironman or spiderman, he's a second tier character is somewhat important. 
I've never been a big Evangeline Lilly fan I've always felt her acting was sub par at best.  The script was decently written, the quantum realm could have certainly used a more ""Avatar"" feel.  Immerse the world and really get into it, which could have highlighted Michelle Pfeiffer getting into detail explaining the realm, her character was a bit dry and she certainly could have filled that role.  Kang was great, Jonathan Majors nailed it.  The rest is exactly what I expected from an ant man movie.  
Personally I rank it higher than ""Love and thunder, Dark world, Eternals, Black Widow, Thor, Captain Marvel, and Iron man 3"" 
It met and slightly exceeded expectations."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not as good as the first movie. Good cinematography would recommend seeing it in Imax. Storyline was just ok. This is not the best marvels movie. Did like the giant ants at the end of the movie.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story was action packed but not overdone.  Not a big Antman fan,  but this one kept my attention.  The effects were absolutely amazing. It was well written."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty great. I‚Äôve seen a lot of bad reviews but fun movie and not sure what you‚Äôre looking for. Turn your brain off and enjoy.
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bro kanged everywhere
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Any scene that doesn't have Kang is kinda bad. Writing is the weakest it's been since Thor 2
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"the story line was a bit tawdry but had its twists and turns plus some comedy...the special effects were good...some of the scenes seemed to be copies of various recent movies (The Matrix, Avatar, Star Wars)...overall a good movie to go see on the big screen..."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst Marvel movies to date. Without Kang it would have been worse. 
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"7/10 for marvel, necessary though."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst MCU film to date next to Thor 2. Terrible plot, too sci-fi. MCU x Star Wars. First 85% of the film was so slow I fell asleep 4 times. Forgettable, don't need to watch."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie good effect s
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,I took a nice long nap!
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was cool to see the backstory of Kang and Janet Van Dyn come to life on a giant screen. As usual, plenty of random hilarious one-liners from Scott Lang (aka Paul Rudd) and Cassie who is now all grown up. MODOK was kinda hilarious but also felt like fan service a little bit. Overall, it was a solid movie - not great but pretty good."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, great CGI, good plot, must watch for marvel fans."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The kids and I enjoyed the movie . Quite surprised we stayed up through the entire thing !
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't really understand why people didn't like this.  Leaps and bounds better than the last Ant-Man, the new Black Panther, and the last Thor. I love Marvel movies, and this is the best since Dr. Strange 2."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I wonder if everyone realizes this whole last phase is what is happening at the same moment Sylvie got her revenge.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know why this movie got low ratings.  I find this movie better than Doctor Strange 2 and Thor:  Love and Thunder.  Great movie to start Phase 5.  Jonathan Majors stole the show playing the Big Bad Kang.  Can't wait what he and his variants have in store in Avengers:  Kang Dynasty.
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ok I finally saw it and it was an OK movie. It was not horrible or boring but seriously the cgi is getting too much. Now I keep hearing about how Kang is the new big bad‚Ä¶.. nope I don‚Äôt see it. Thanos was much more of a threat than this guy was.  Now I don‚Äôt blame the actors, I just blame the writers. In the end, it is what it is."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,It should have been a two part movie that goes further in depth of the villain characters Kang and Modok
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Much better than I expected.  Definitely too over the top, but overall one of the best Marvel outings in a while.   Better than BP2.  Way better than Thor.  Loved MODOK.  Kang should have been tougher to defeat, but we'll see if he comes back.  Would have been awesome if they could have brought the real Microverse characters into the movie.   With the Microverse, an incredible amount of stories to tell.  Overall, some mistakes, not perfectly executed, but I'm back and interested in the MCU."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,really like quantumania!!!! must watch!!
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie had a good plot and will hopefully be a good setup to the next phase of marvel. I very much enjoyed it.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great cgi and good start to phase 5
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania works for an Ant-Man film, but it's incapable of setting up much anticipation for a ""Multiverse Saga""."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Greatness as expected, loved the relaxing theater seats"
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it, funny and action!"
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great, got to explain the quantumania. Love the marvel movies and Paul is hot and love the way he is narrated the movie."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Glad we ignored the reviews, hate Rotten Tomatoes.   Great comic book movie!  Totally original story, cool effects and great on the big screen.  A+ cast too."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the return of Darren Cross and visually it was a masterpiece post credit scenes were amazing cant wait for Loki season 2 now
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a great ""trilogy-capper"". I'm an old guy, with ""old eyes"" üòÅ, so I'm probably not going to pick up all the perceived ""defects"" in the CGI that I keep reading that many are complaining about. I just don't see it. Literally. Lol

I think that EVERY character shined, especially Michelle Pfeiffer chewing the scenery, and Michael Douglas getting a heroic turn, as well. Yes, it's supposed to be, and should be, about Scott and Hope, but I'm kinda glad that everyone had equal parts to play. Even Cassie had her ""coming out"" moments, because she will surely be featured in upcoming installments, to go along with Kamala, and America, among others. 

I think the only thing I disagree with, is the hype for Jonathan Majors, as Kang. The critics are blowing this guy up, as the next Poitier. I'm not seeing it; not from this role, honestly. Maybe he's great in Lovecraft Country, or other roles. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Don't get me wrong; he was good, and intimidating, but I found T'challa (Boseman - R.I.P.) and Killmonger (Jordan), far more dynamic, on the screen (Black Panther). We're going to get A LOT more Majors, from here on out, so let's see what he does. 

I think that this movie, in later years, will receive much more appreciation, than it's getting, now. I watched Ant-Man and the Wasp a week before AM3, just to refresh my memory, because I have it on Digital, and I forgot how GOOD it was!"
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Tired plot line. Couldn‚Äôt wait for the movie to end. CGI was great but there was too much of it. 
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Should have known it was going to be good when I started reading bad reviews.
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"First off I really liked the first 2 Ant Man movies. But I had a bad feeling about this one ever since I saw the trailer. The trailer reminded me of a 70's Yes album cover.

The whole think was kind of a mess, it was almost like it couldn't decide if it was a Marvel movie or a Star Wars movie with all the weird alien characters. One was even like a Jar Jar Binks comic relief character.
Bill Murray who I have loved in so many movies was just so out of place I thought. His casting did not fit his character at all. Jonathan Majors was great though as Kang.
Giving it 2 stars because the end battle was pretty good even if it did feel a little like a formulaic Marvel final battle sequence, was still well done.
I dunno, am scratching my head at all the rave reviews from all the Marvel fans. Has their standards dropped this low that they think this was a great movie? Had this been a DC movie the Marvel fans would have torn it to shreds.
It was at least better than the last Thor movie, hoping the new GOTG is better though it won't take very much effort."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a good continuation of the Antman saga, with a great lead into the Kang Dynasty wars."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It was Great... Love MARVEL!!!!!!
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. A lot of good one liners that filled the gaps and sent marvel into the next phase
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was awesome. A combination of Star Wars, The Matrix and Alice in Wonderland. Great science and a spell bounding plot. I highly recommend it."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, Best marvel movie since Spider-Man, No Way Home!"
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just saw this movie and I loved it. I loved how we were immersed in the beautiful world of the Quantum Realm. I really connected with Scott and Cassie and the whole cast was great. The movie definitely had a Star Wars feel. Critics what do you want it's Antman ffs. You guys really missed the boat on this one. Majors is a beast as Kang and so menacing on the screen. He will definitely be a force to reckon moving forward, and I can hardly wait to see more of him in Loki season 2."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what the problem of the haters is, I think they are really nitpicky with each and every MCU movie at this time. Yeah the movie has flaws, but not more or more serious ones than most MCU movies had before. Fact is, it's about 2 hours long, and me and my friend had a blast and were never bored.

It's perfectly fine popcorn entertainment, and frankly doesn't even try, or need to be more. And Jonathan Majors as Kang is pretty great - I'm looking forward to seeing more from him."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing production and otherworldly settings - also plenty of humor. Loved it!
"Mar 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Just not a great movie!
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,SO FRINKING AWESOME!!!
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,The quantum realm stated having a lot of Star Wars feels to it in some scenes. Overall though a good film.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed this movie!! I personally could have done without 3D, though."
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Great giggles for me
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Es un asco una pelicula infantil con argumentos mediocres donde los buenos siempre ganan es muy clich√© y abusa extraordinariamente del poder del guion, magicamente todo pasa por que si, el doblaje desespera y no tiene coherencia ni emocion, decepcionate las actuaciones y las bromas dan cringe"
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang is great. Quantum Realm is cool. Good chemistry. Pointless coarse language.Glas we went.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was good but everyone hates I don't know why.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie to watch. I believe it to be on par with the previous antman movies. It was definitely better than Thor Love and thunder. Not to funny, or Corny just the right amount of Action, comedy. i liked the pacing of the movie and Kang  is a great villain."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this movie, it is a setup for future projects, cheesy comedy but overall well done"
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Defiantly enjoyed that it wasn‚Äôt an over saturated comedy like some other entries of phase 4. It was a good start to the new phase and where the MCU will being doing from hear on out. Hope the MCU keeps this trend going.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie was well produced and put together i was entertained 
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jonathan Majors is phenomenal. He singlehandedly saved this film. Everything else is B movie level. The CGI looks like trash. The plot is meh. Probably should have introduced the TVA in the film itself.
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok not the best of mcu but decent for a family day with no big plans
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I see the different routes they can take, but was expecting a bigger intro to Kang coming in. Also was horribly portraying most characters in movie (MODAK)."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Really fun movie for the family! Critics are like dinosaurs..not needed and extinct!! Go see the movie for yourself! 
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was awesome in every way
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,i like the movie when first saw the reveiws on critics i didn't know about it but i decieded to watch it and when i did i liked it. now days when i see reviews i mainly trust the audience. kang was the best part of the movie. i guess the worst part of the movie was kinda the begining which was kinda bad
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed Ant-Man and the wasp: Quantumania, although there were a few laugh out loud moments (which weren't supposed to be funny I think), the story was good, the writing was good, the acting was good, the special effects were very good and I had a good time watching it, which is how I judge a movie - was I entertained?  Yes!!!  Go see it and make sure you stay for the 2nd post credits scene!!!"
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,A Marvel est√° completamente perdida!
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Its was good.  Enjoyed the action.
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,If it wasn‚Äôt for Kang this would be as bad as Thor: The Dark Worls
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie. Jonathan major did an excellent job.  He was awesome playing the villain. Love it, love it and I love it."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome I don't know why people hated it so much.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun and crazy movie, I love it"
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lacking the humor of the originals 
Shoddy sound throughout"
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,To be honest this movie is great i don't care what other people have to say but this is a great movie
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"loved it, best Antman In The Series"
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I did not care for Jonathan Majors as Kang. The role called for better vocal skills. His various speeches were dull.
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was just a normal movie with comedyüëç Kang is a killer Villian tho.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Not bad it didn‚Äôt waste time getting into the action
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,In my opinion better than the first 2.
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,I fell asleep in the cinema.. Jonathan majors was only good thing about it
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"it's an antman movie I actually want to see again  loved it was more serious. wish I went day one u
instead of listening to the new hate on mcu fad"
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"this movie was really cool, you can watch it with the family, it doesn't have those boring scenes of militancy and rebellion XD"
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a fun movie. Serious only when necessary but charming overall. Well in line with the previous Ant-Man films. Johnathan Majors looks good as the villain, setting up the big bad for the current phase in the MCU. Pfeiffer and Douglas are strong in their performances. And Rudd is low key which makes his final showdown that much more powerful."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it non stop action it was a great Marvel movie .I go to all the Marvel movies
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good MCU film. If you like MCU films, ignore the haters, and see it. It was just a fun movie from beginning to end."
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,Some fun but I am done with the quantum realm. Actors did a great job with what they had to work with.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant army VS Kang army
Today, I watched the movie and I found it so amazing. Paul and Jonathan were awesome at there respective roles. Even the story was thriller and some what unpredictable.
Paul's smile is so fascinating  that it can make anyone's day just like it made mine.ü§ç
Can't wait to see more Kang in action"
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film is weird, dumb and funny all at the same time. It's a super action-packed mess with a pinch of dumb but funny jokes. The script, the actors and the humour are good. There's no drama here. I would have understood if they hadn't emphasised it, but the father-child issues are waving to me again. Overall, it's a good entertaining Marvel movie for the evening, but as a movie with a capital letter: it carries no value.

"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Storyline had too many holes and the CGI was cheap. The series is falling and the studio doesn't care because fans will still watch just because of the namesake of ""Marvel."""
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Awful. Boring. None of the charm and comedy of the first 2 films. All visual and no heart or soul - not to mention the lackluster script. There's a saying that ‚ÄòEven a bad Marvel movie is a good Marvel movie'. Not anymore.
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a good movie. Although it's not as exciting as I thought it would be, there were some very good moments. Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors were really good. The visual effects were not bad. This movie could have been a lot better if they handled the plot conveniences, MODOK and Kang a bit better."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun movie with great acting; it also looks amazing! In my opinion,  the critics got this movie wrong."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Incrediblly entertaining to watch with the family
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Marvel is showing its age and Ant-Man 3 has all the warning signs of this. The story is fine, the CGI is rough and distracting. Kang is a great Villian....MODOK is so bad he needs to be studied. The visuals are both great but somehow when you place actors in front of it, it looks terrible! 
It helps if you do your homework on this one to understand the Kang character. 
As a popcorn night at the movies type of film it works. Just remove your critical hat and have fun."
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Top 5 for worse movie ever there were a few bright spots but not worth sitting through that to see them !!!!
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Mesmo sendo um bom filme,ele apresenta uma queda de qualidade narrativa e signific√¢ncia para o mcu"
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,What a mess. Worst Marvel film I have ever seen. No redeeming qualities whatsoever.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was very pleasing and entertaining. it was kinda dumb but for some reason, I adore this film!"
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible): esperaba mas
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The characters and plot were great. The special effects are amazing. It kept your interest most of the time.
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, dull up until the end fight scene and that barely held my attention. The second post credit scene was more exciting than the whole movie."
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"uh... it wasn't that bad but the MV(Kang) lacked attractiveness and seemed to be just one of most feeble villians in the MCU during the movie. Also, Antman's unique size reglating power didn't stand out that much in which I think caused the movie to be a bit dubious. Finally, it was worth my time(a little bit)  but I regret the fact that I didn't watch the spoiler review instead of spending my money on the tickets."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a great movie
Story was Kool and it leaves the expectation to what comes nexts"
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was absolutely boring. I felt no suspense the entire showing. I never asked myself how will they pull it off, or who will die, what's gonna happen. It'd the same boring script as the last one. 

Protagonist's family is in danger. Protagonist cries about his daughter. Protagonist is an absolute idiot. Family and friendship save the day. I can't even say it had good character design or had amazing graphics. I've seen better designs watching my brother play fornite. The only good character was Modok and he had leas than 5 minutes of screen time.  

You won't be on the edge of your seat watching this film. You won't be chattering your teeth. It's not even a good spectacle. Should've just gone to see cocain bear instead."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots big plot twists and great characters
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the film with my two kids, (12&15), yes the storyline was a little lacking, MODOK was something of an afterthought, bit too much CGI, but overall it introduced Kang well and kicks off Ph5 with lots more to look forward to.  Don't understand why so many column inches are being given to panning this film.  What should the everyday family and film go'er care more about, the audience's score or the so called professional critics score???  Go, enjoy this big screen Marvel film with your family, you'll enjoy it :-)"
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,With a few ups and downs but overall a very entertaining movie with a amazing villain. A excellent way to kick of phase 5! Don't mind the critics!
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I had a lot of fun.  I haven't liked most things in phase four but I really enjoyed this one
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall, a very good and entertaining movie if you have been following all the existing MCU stuff. Unlike some MCU movies, this one is heavily entrenched in the greater MCU. The following is a list of stuff I'd strongly suggest you see before watching, though:

The first 2 Ant Man movies, obviously. Avengers Infinity War/Endgame, predictably. Loki, surprisingly. Captain America, Civil War, debatably. They really just reference that last one as an event that happened but you should watch it anyway because it's a really good movie. 

This felt like one of those movies where they were putting it out there to grow the MCU and set things up for the future. And it worked well because they didn't do just that. This was not a 2 hour trailer for the next big thing. It was entertaining in its own right while also allowing the involved characters to do their cool thing and grow themselves.

Overall, if you have been watching the MCU so far, I think you'll find the movie enjoyable. It brought hope to my mind that the MCU did not peak with Infinity War and Endgame, which was a very real concern after the last few movies."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Visually stunning! 3D is the way to go
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,We just love Marvel movies...they never disappoint.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the movie. I think it was ok.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang kics ass!.. Johnathan Majors did his thing!..
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Love marvel Kang was so OP I think they should have had a better lead up to him but can't wait to see Loki season 2
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Could‚Äôve been better
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Avengers has done it again and so has the movie theater. I just love the whole experience me and my friend enjoyed ourselves and everything was fantastic.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie! Really thought it was a great kick off for this new phase of the marvel universe!
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved how Ant-man was able to hold his own against Kang.
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This sucked. Corny acting, poor cgi, no baddies. Would go lower if I could."
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a solid movie like the last 2 ant-mans. Definitely kept my interest throughout.
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's an easy Ant Man movie. Here the trick is you are going to be entertained: don't expect Endgame. Ignore the bit rip off Star Wars, it doesn't last much and don't be resentful about, Mr. Douglas will clean that up."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great, focused story. MODOK was cringe worthy at moments."
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie was Marvel meets Star Wars with a side of Mad Max sprinkled with Peter Pan's lost boys or something like that. It was not the best nor the worse. Michelle Pfeiffer can do no wrong!!! She is my favorite character in the movie and along with her senior counterparts who I believe carried this movie. Even Bill Murray's character understand the cues between funny and serious. There was a steady pace of dialogue and action from beginning to end. Ant Man deserved its trilogy - the first one still being the better of the three but this was was a step up from the second one. I missed Michael Pena as Luis. I feel like he should have came in riding an ant!!!
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great chapter in the series loved it!!
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sooo good.  Opened up So many possibilities!
Cryptic Easter egg 
Loki, Owen Wilson,  was that ""Creeds""  nemesis???
  All the kudos to heroes known and may have yet to meet."
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was so slow. Some of the creatures in the movie were pretty cool.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed and liked a lot. And MCU ""kids"" should STOP taking it for granted. I mean it."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining. Me and my girls enjoyed the show
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A bit predictable, but lots of action and entertaining."
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There is a house in my town that has had extensions built on extensions built on extensions. Initially it was quirky and fun but now you look at it and it seems cluttered and messy. You worry what kind of foundation is holding this clusterfuck together. Ultimately I think it just needs to be demolished and we all just move on. I think we reached the same point with the MCU. It had its moment and it lasted 2 decades, it can die now."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the stranger entries in the franchise but worth the watch. The story was a little  haphazardly put together but I felt like it worked well enough. The Pym team is one of my favorites in the MCU so I was happy with it.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was better than expected, I like the fact that the universal atomic theory is the basis of the quantum realm. Plot was good, the whole multiverse theory is something to pick at your brain. Overall I'd say it was a solid 8.5/10"
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10 movie spider-man carried it
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,to much of the same thing over and over and over
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie! Majors is great, Paul Rudd and the rest of the cast was awesome too. Of course you'll miss the comedy style of previous movies but I it waw good to see ant man come through a crysis point on his personal story."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome!! Another Marvel movie I love!!
"Mar 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,Awesome set up for the future phases of the MCU
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors shines here obviously. I'm left needing more Kang and a little less of the side characters. This needed to solely be a Scott Lang vs Kang face-off with future consequences for it to be top tier Marvel. It's funny and witty and the characters charm, it's what you'd expect from the Ant-Man franchise with a little bit more of the action turned up."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of fun, ties a lot of MCU together. Will watch again."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Starts off slow‚Ä¶but pretty decent movie 4/5 stars! Kang will be cool!! Phase 5 has begun!! üëÄüëÄ
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the experience
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"sinceramente un asco, no vale gastar 1$ en verla...solo sirve para verla gratis de pasada por matar el tiempo con algo nuevo"
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was just fun.  I don't need to be preached at or have every movie I see delve into the social statements and blah, blah, blah.  My son loved it, I didnt want my time and money back and we were entertained for 2 hours.  It was visually stunning.  Like The Eternals but not drudgy and preachy and awful."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie developed Kang beautifully and gave us a lot to hope for in the upcoming phases.
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,First movie was WAY better. we need Simple. Not a good sequel. Characters were good though
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Full of action, humor. LOVED all the CGI
Johnathan Majors is definitely a fierce presence!!"
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I didn't like it or hate it, which is a shame, its the continuing trend of phase 4 and on.  first act i really dislike, gave me star war vibes. i don't hate star wars, but this is a mcu film... ant man's daughter robotic acting, cheesy characters are other things i didn't enjoy. best thing in the film was kang, but this is part 3 of the movie and maybe the last ant man movie, i was hoping for a bigger bang.  But its not really about ant man, and more of kang."
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lazy script and poor CGI. Not even Bill Murray is funny on this one.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"For me, This is movie is awesome. I like the 2 end credit scenes of the movie."
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"no interesting character, no interesting plot, annoying daughter character, same old marvel story. NO MORE MARVEL."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic!  Great fun!
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"A good mix of fun, suspense and awesome action. Introducing a new Marvel big bad guy! Ant-Man is always fun and funny with our being too goofy ( unlike the last Thor movie which went too heavy on making the hero a duffus.) The only thing missing was Scott‚Äôs ex-con business partners. They always add an excellent outside comic element and subplot."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,A worthy addition to the Marvel Universe. It took a bit longer than was necessary to get going but it ultimately came through.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great fun!   Continuing the MCU tradition.  Stay through the end of the credits!
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Having used up 10 for Avengers, Infinity Wars and 11/10 for Endgame, Quantumania deserves a solid 8. The plot was reasonable, CGI was good and there were no boring, long scenes. There are some better Marvel movies like Ragnorak and Civil War, but Antman is definitely worth watching."
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as others made it out to be, crowd seemed to also think it was funny (enough, but not all jokes landed) and a visual spectacle, not as much as Multiverse of Madness though. I was in an IMAX in SF, sp of course the local references played better."
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"TOO MUCH cursing !!  The part  where Antman & MODOK talk about Modok being a ""Dick"" was TOTALLY stupid, unnecessary and did nothing positive for the movie.  
Ant totally NOT what Modok is in the comics.
also, It was Ant-man & Wasp meets Star Wars. - Didn't like this.
Most of the ""Alien"" life-forms were dumb and over the top - especially the Gel like creature obsessed with holes.
Wasp's lines were too few."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,it was creative but some parts were difficult for me to follow.
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome def would see again!!
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Solid MCU entry but I expected a lil more. Worth checking out 
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie. Some of the special effects were poor but overall a great start to phase 5 of the MCU.
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Suspenseful, well acted, Jonathan Major was great, funny, inventive, lots of ""spark "", great start to phase 5!!!"
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,totally entertained ^_^
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had a lovely fun time at this movie. I liked the trippy world they created for the quantum world, the family aspect of the story, introduction of a terrifying new villain- it was fun! The pacing worked for me. I loved the cast - great chemistry between all of them."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Family friendly and fun to watch
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It wasn't what fans are saying. I was always looking forward to the projects brought by the MCU. With recent developments, including Ant Man 3 it fails to present a good story, clouded with terrible VFX and CGI, it's really hard to like this film. Only positive would be the introduction of Kang. The worst offender is how the plot develops, no spoilers, but everything could've been avoided if there was continuity between Ant Man films."
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,great movie if you‚Äôre 12-16
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Visible effects are awesome and a wholesome family movie!!
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Est√° bien pero no es la mejor, claro que ya que est√° muy conectada a lo que viene hay que verla si o si"
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"good storyline, plot, and cast."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure why the ratings are so low for this movie. My friends and I actually think it was the best Marvel movie since Spider-Man No Way Home. It was entertaining, funny and had a really good story. And best of all, it set up future Marvel movies like was done with Thanos in the past. I was starting to give up on Marvel but this movie sucked me back in. Also Jonathan Peters was excellent as Kang. I look forward to seeing him in future films. For those who are looking for an Oscar worthy movie, this isn't it. But then again what comic book movie is? It was exactly what it was meant to be, very entertaining. It should be rated much higher on the tomato meter. I highly recommend it."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a super fun and weird Sci-fi movie.
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Awful - should have listened to reviewers.
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Obviously this is my opinion but I enjoyed this movie. Disclaimer: I was a Marvel comic book reader for many years and am just thrilled to see so many of my favorite characters brought to life, as it were, on the big screen. Jonathan Majors knocks his portrayal of Kang ( which variant, who knows?) Out of the park, Michelle Pfeiffer is superb as Janet Van Dyne, the original Wasp and Michael Douglas looks like he's having some fun. Sure, the father/daughter story between Scott and Cassie does get overwhelmed by the Kang storyline. Hopefully, we'll get more regarding their relationship in the future as, I can only assume, Cassie will join the ranks of the Avengers and Scott won't be able to get out of his own way trying to protect her. The scenes were he tried to show her how to use the size changing ability to the best effect in a fight were a nice touch. The mid-credit and post-credit scenes were wonderful, a wave of nostalgia flowing through my person. I plan to see it again."
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel, what happened? Oh wait, it's Disney. Overloaded with CGI and cringe, I can't believe the MCU has gotten like this. Prize for most horrible character goes to Cassy, worst look is MODOK, and best BJ lips is Kang."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant movie, one of the best marvel movies to date. Make sure to stay for the end credit scenes too :)"
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Very exciting and entertaining. Great action and Jonathan majors was phenomenal. Don't judge this movie off of the rotten tomato critic rating
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Completely Bonkers even by MCU standards, borrowing a lot from Star Wars. Whilst the plot leaves more to be desired, Paul Rudd is endlessly endearing as Scott Lang and overall it retains the simple fun we've come to appreciate from the Ant man franchise, even with the heightened scale. 
Also Jonathan Majors is simply fantastic as Kang the conqueror, truly terrifying."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the most visually stunning and delightfully weird films I've ever seen. Jonathan Majors is incredible and complicated to watch. Surprisingly epic. Felt like watching a Star Wars film in many ways.
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"What an absolute thrill ride from beginning to end ties so much together from moon knight, Wanda vision and the Loki series so beautifully setting up the next series of secret invasion. This was everything AntMan."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what the reviewers were watching, but I was entertained and had my helping of escapism for 2 and change hours. What more do you want or need?"
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring movie, actors definitely phoned it in."
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Enjoyed the unique environment and characters as well as how the story involved the entire Lang/VanDyne family. Story also told mostly from Janet's perspective. Not bad for project created during the pandemic.
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a fun movie and a great movie for a big screen experience. The people nitpicking it seem unable to suspend disbelief. There are no perfect movies and no one should expect a Marvel or DC movie to be ""believable"". It's fantasy action, for Pete's sake!"
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched Quantumania with my teenage daughter and we both enjoyed it. I think it was a perfectly adequate summer blockbustery type movie and while there were times I thought it would lean in a darker direction, which the critics would have liked, I was happy it didn't! Not every movie has to (or should even try to be) anything more than a fun adventure that takes us to another place for an hour or two."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this movie. It looked fantastic on the big screen. I really liked all of the action and humor.
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's was  not my favorite  mcu movies but it was  a good  moive  I love the cast     so watch it   cinema   or just  wait for it to drop  on disney plus
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,People are definitely hating on this movie for the sake of it. It is a generally enjoyable movie
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I saw this in D-box 3D. I had high hopes for this movie. I like the look of Kang, but the character was written pretty poorly. Jonathon Majors did a great job with the material that he was handed. MODOK was a train wreck. The scenes with him made me feel like I was watching a low budget film. Tho post credit scene made me cringe. There isn't anything memorable from the film. I wanted more of Bill Murray's character. I was disappointed but not as bad as I was for Eternals. Something has to change at Marvel. I am losing interest."
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A lot of fun. Quantum Realm feels a bit like Star Wars, and Kang is an imposing villain."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Lots a action.
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the characters and the writing, I laughed more during this film than any other MCU movie and I've seen them all. Cool to watch on the big screen with all of the colorful and dazzling details of the quantum realm. Super creative and visually pleasing. I really loved it."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Good story line and entertaining.
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was everything I had hoped for and more!  Awesome eye candy, I was very entertained."
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"well, I watched this kringe parade called Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. In fact, the cringe here is only a M.O.D.O.K (From each of his appearances on the screen, the whole room laughed out loud), the rest is normal. The plot is 50/50, the script too. Kang is good, but he's not an Avengers-level threat. The graphics are very bad, you can clearly see that the actors are just standing in front of the screen, where the pictures just change. The wasp is not needed at all in this film, she just runs around the whole film in the background in order to do what she did at the end. Jannet is needed here purely to tell the exposition and tell about Kang, nothing else. Hank just drives a plane the whole movie, but he's good at the end. Scott and Cassie are central characters who have a father-child line due to Scott wanting to make up for the 5 years he was not with Cassie. As a result, the rating is 3.5 / 5, better than most projects of the 4th phase, but I'm more looking forward to Guardians of the Galaxy 3, James Gunn will definitely not let you down, but I had reached the limit of trust in Peyton Ridd even after such a 2 part, but 3 is better than 2. But still, I liked part 1 more."
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Huge Budget , non stop action and mammoth special effects what could go wrong , ironically a Story line  that could have been written on an Ants handkerchief , no depth of characters a tiny plot stretched out ,every minute you watch is millions of $$ 's of CGI . The continuity of Michelles hair was shocking every scene it looked different . But it was still the best thing showing at the Cinema !!!"
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a fun, entertaining film that did not take itself seriously."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"plot was simple and easy to follow, it was good, but another mulriverse movie"
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really good! Recommend 3d version of you get the chance.
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Every second was entertaining!!
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Is a good movie to watch.
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania is what I expect from a Marvel film. No more, no less. It's not Endgame, but at least it's not Black Panther 2 (which was far too depressing, and not in a good way like Infinity War). Could the FX be better? Perhaps, but I grew up on Star Trek: The Original Series. To me, the story rules as long as the FX aren't 1960's era Dr. Who. And the story here is solid, and advances the MCU. Plus, I had fun! Isn't that the basic point to most movies?"
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"What can I say, the ""professional"" critics don't like the same movies as moviegoers. Too often they give crappy reviews to movies people love. People don't go to watch AntMan for high drama, they go for a fun time and hopefully a thrill ride, at least I did when I saw it in 4DX. Had fun and enjoyed the movie."
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,In the 21st century I am amazed that people leave the theater before all the credits roll; stay until the lights come up.  This movie is a direct tie-in to some other Marvel Universe entities and didn't disappoint.  I don't feel I wasted my time or the extra fee for 3-D.
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie held my attention seen that it is 2 1/2 hour movie its a good movie to go see
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the best antman movie and the best start to phase 5 . There‚Äôs a twist at the end that people didn‚Äôt notice . The entire movie is a good time so I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing it again .
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a great, exciting and entertaining movie, the movie that will open phase 5 of the MCU that leaves you wanting to see Kang in future movies.
The only thing I didn't like is that Luis doesn't appear in the movie."
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,It‚Äôs kinda boring to be a Marvel movie
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thought it was good, done well, the plot a little iffy, but good, and perfect for 3 d"
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It didn‚Äôt go off the ending from the last movie, started a whole new plot with no backstory. Not worth seeing in theaters."
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Bom, foi o filme do Kang, o Conquistado e n√£o do Homem formiga, mas n√£o foi ruim."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a solid movie for a stand alone character. I think people got really spoiled with Infinity war and end game with so many characters as a group. I liked this movie the quantum realm  was cool and Kang was also good. Its alot better movie than the last 2 Marvel movies Thor Love and Thunder and BP 2
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic! Marvel does is again. Great action adventure with the humor you expect from Ant-Man's Paul Rudd! More Sci-Fi than ""superhero"" and that's a good thing. Got an old school Star Wars vibe at certain parts of the film. Jonathan Majors shines as the new Marvel villain Kang. Also‚Ä¶ Absolutely mind blowing in 3D, if you see it in old flat 2D you aren't really seeing it."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,it was another fantastic marvel movie
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is a fast-paced and amusing adventure that shows us a different side of the MCU without losing its chemistry. Considering the world they were creating, it has decent visuals and stellar 3D effects that immerse the audience. Sure, some of the jokes don‚Äôt land right, but the film did it‚Äôs job. It sets the tone and stakes of Phase 5 with great detail without giving away too much about Kang. Jonathan Majors is the perfect casting choice for Kang, he brings a glorious performance to the table and saves the movie from its underwhelming moments."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"a great movie, highly recommend."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,loved it. awesome movie. so much fun.
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it, found the movie very good, would recommend it r, for Antman lovers"
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jonathan Majors does a fairly good in Carrying this Movie. My word it was poor
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great. Awesome. Loved the updated suits. Worth seeing again.
"Mar 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"You need not to have expectations except for expecting nothing, in that case, the movie even entertains and keeps you laughing. With that said, the MCU is taking a turn that I don't like."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't get the hate. The best Ant-man movie to me. Did miss Luis though but it makes sense why he isn't there.
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed it from start to finish. It's an Ant-man movie. FUN and a bit silly. Paul Rudd and the rest of the cast were great.
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Good story with action and great effects
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Marvel movie. Wish the story line was more complete and less slow scenes. Looking for more action for Ant-Man and the Wasp next time.
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Look at the CGI. We need to bring back costume design so badly, but Marvel continues to run the quality of their costumes into the ground. Protagonists look like the spy kids."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I really enjoyed the movie, loved the special effects"
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! I was afraid it would suck, because of the constant toxic babies on the ""Internets"". I'm glad I gave it a chance. It just demonstrates that cretics and social media are never right :)"
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn‚Äôt get to see it due to an medical emergency
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,really good can‚Äôt say more
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is mid, like the whole movie, but the end is the worst. Like, a bunch of time, kang could get in the portal and go back to earth, or kill ant man,or kill all the heroes, and all the ants. By the way, Kang said that he killed Thor and multiple avengers, but he couldnt kill ant man and the wasp. You can see that for killing extra he use his laser but the main charachters he just dont, he doesnt really use his tech to kill ant man or wasp because he is DUMB. This Kang should be as scary and dangerous as Thanos but you fell no consequence, you fell no fear ,you fell no threat at all. Marvel maid terrible end arc with terrible figthing strategy, a bunch of times they just talk instead of fight, or they take the helmet off for no reason in mid fight, or dont plan nothing at all and run into an army ( which they beat them all, like fast and furios )."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,johnathan majors was the star
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Spoiler-free: 

Paul Rudd in a superhero dad movie? Yes please. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Se disfruta mucho m√°s en 3D que en formato original, pero la historia para Kang es tan lenta que aburre los primeros 45 min. De pelicula, aunque.. al final se levanta con una pelea brutal y digna, pero luego cae en un final mediocre tipo CAPITANA MARVEL, fuera de KANG no hay nada m√°s que ver."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a lot of fun. Paul Rudd is great as usual and Jonathon Majors is terrific as the villain.
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie itself was good, no blowing away at all. They did have some comedy in some scenes which was a nice switch up. Worth a watch, with some good end credit scenes."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel movies have really gone down in storytelling over the past few years. They need to focus more on individual plot and characters rather than trying to tie everything together for another huge Avengers movie. Make  At this point it just feels like a cash grab. Make Marvel fun again.
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sadly numbing in the state of drowning in tasteless action movies, Quantumania barely survives the test of simply being a good film, however decent Jonathan Majors' performance is."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Liked the humor but they overdid the special effects. Would have preferred more of a storyline.
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Eeeek.  Did they just throw this together?
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the most boring Marvel movie I've watched. And I'm a Marvel's fan.
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Storyline was good and the effects. The end credits scene had me a little puzzled but I hope theres a sequel to it because I need an explanation lol
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another very funny MCU movie, with Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Major fiting perfect on their characters. Great action scenes and visual effects."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is everything you would expect from an Ant Man movie and more. Jonathan Majors steals the show. The movie can get a little silly at times, but it's what we expect and love about these movies. This movie definitely feels like the starting point for the bigger picture picture of what MARVEL is about to do next. Full of action and comedy. Weather you are invested in the MCU or just looking for a weekend flick to catch, this would be a great choice."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie .. enjoyable
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Definitely my favorite Star Wars movie 
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"saw it last night and I get where regular reviewers might not like it but if you have followed the MCU and all it's varieties, you'll will love it because this is beginning to tie things together that we've been wondering about. as a stand alone movie it might seem weak but as MCU canon, it's awesome."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,La neta si esta entretenida
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the movie very much.
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed this movie, visuals were awesome, had just enough comedy to make it wonderful film."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it the movie was atleast a 7 out of ten if you let ""critics"" otherwise known as people who look too much into the laws of physics and the reality of movies tell you how to feel about it then your meat rider nothing else to say about you"
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is the third film in the Ant-Man series of comedy/action/heist films.  Each film expands (pun intended) the world, the action, and the cast of heroes as the family shrinks down to a vast bizarre setting that harkens to the best Fantastic Four comics of the 60s and 70s.  

If you go into this film looking for dark, depressing, grounded, and serious, you've entered the wrong theater.  As far as Marvel films go, the camp level mirrors that of Thor Love and Thunder.  It's about fun first and foremost.

If you've caught up with the Marvel films and series on Disney+, you know we are reintroduced to the concept of Kang the Conqueror from Loki, but this Kang (like all Kang's in the multiverse) is his own man, exiled by the council of Kangs to live outside of time in the microscopic Quantum Realm.

Majors does another great job making this Kang unique from He Who Remains.  If you haven't seen another MCU project, first, you're missing out. Second, the only ""missing pieces"" come from the first two Ant-Man movies. If you are watching the third movie without seeing the previous two, that's on you.

This movie is so much fun, with great spectacle, action, and that Paul Rudd charm that keeps you smiling along with him.

Don't listen to the doomsayers. This movie checks all the boxes a family adventure comedy should provide.  Five Stars."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun outting with familiar characters, providing a solid introduction to Kang, in his less than, amiccable, variation. 
Felt like a star wars movie with Antman flavour."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy entretenida y graciosa, me gusto mucho la pelicula, aunque me hubiese gustado que kang se luzca mas para la pelicula de Advengers"
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,ignore the critics its a very enjoyable film
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went to see Ant-Man on February 20th. In the movie, Ant-Man and his family accidentally went into the quantum realm and found life in it. The ""life species"" were scared of Jannet because she used to be friends with Kang the Conqueror. Ant-Man and the Wasp fought Kang and helped the people that are living in the quantum realm to free themselves.

I was laughing through the entire movie because the people in the quantum realm are funny and Paul Rudd. Especially in the M.O.D.O.K scenes. The action was a tiny bit confusing but it was GREAT. It was one of the funniest Marvel movies I watched but I prefer Thor Love and Thunder comedy. R.I.P MODOK The lost avenger."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"filme horrivel em quase tudo, atua√ß√£o, CGI e estoria. Gastei dinheiro atoa vendo isto."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The growing problem Marvel is going to have is that the average movie goer is going struggle with some of the abstract concepts around Kang's character arch, the multi-verse and time variations.  With that said, I'm a sci-fi marvel/rick&morty nerd so I absolutely loved the movie and it's interconnectedness.  In fact, it's my favorite Phase 4 movie so far.  Take the complexity aside, this movie needs to be seen in the theaters and preferrably in one of the higher formats like 4DX or IMAX 3D.  The digital special effects and action were amazing and left me in awe like it was 2009 and watching Avatar in Imax 3D for the first time."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a fun action packed movie. With a different tone than the first two films that I think helps make it standout reminded me of ragnarok in a good way. Kang is incredible and the complaints about MODOK I get but how serious was it going to be as a villain in live action he's just a big head with guns, so I quite i enjoyed the direction it went. My only complaint is I think it would have been a good thing if they explained the council of kangs  more for the none comic book fans. I would be happy with another ant man movie too or a MODOK spin off."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"These Marvell universe movies are getting worse and worse , so disappointing "
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Achei o filme divertido, apesar dos furos de roteiro."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,This film lacks the creativity and fun of the two prior entries of this sub franchise. Everyone feels side lined for Kang who in my opinion doesn't carry the film very well. Added with the terrible VFX and CGI this isn't a classic MCU entry that'll be remembered.
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Entertaining enough but felt like a star wars rip off. The girl who plays cassie really took me out of the film as she isn't really acting. I don't know why standards have dropped so much but she and many more need acting lessons, you can't just speed through your lines like that and show no emotion, charisma or effort. Michelle Pheiffer is amazing as always and Paul Rudd is ant man, embodying everything that goes with his goofy characters but even Kang was boring, predictable and sort of flat, despite the numerous accolades hes gotten for the role, it was a pretty meek performance. No real stakes or danger, and the father/daughter relationship is so lacking, there is 0 chemistry between ant man and cassie."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sadly I was not a fan of this Ant Man Quantumania. I LOVED the first one because it was filled with action, humor, wit, great characters and a wonderful story. This one felt like Disney just recycled their Star Wars sound stages and updated their bar scene characters. The storyline was idiotically drawn out and the characters in the movie were poorly acted. I was very disappointed in the entire movie and would have loved to have seen more Avenger style wit."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was awesome. The plot was solid, Jonathan Majors was compelling in his performance, characters showed good growth. At this point I don't know why folks expect marvel movies to be stand alone. It's the third movie in the franchise and I think the only real viewing required is that you watch the previous two Ant-Man movies, infinity war, endgame and Loki. And Loki is more of a bonus than required. Only half a star lost for two complaints. 1) CGI struggled at times. 2) the cast from Ant-Man 2 was not complete. His friends from prison could have been included somehow out side the quantum realm."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not a fun experience, lacks emotion, does not build on relatable characters and the story is a mess. The actors did what they could but writing and directing is really bad. Pass at best."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie !!! For you to understand it you have to watch the lokie episodes .
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie started to glitch and cut off with in the first 20 mins. Fandango wouldn't let me have a refund. So I paid to watch this movie for nothing.
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was rough, it feels like Marvel still has not found its footing since End Game. I don't know if they  were trying to juggle too many things at once or what, but it was very underwhelming."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Antman is not the horrendous movie it is made out to be, but it furthermore pushes the mcu into the rabbit whole of the theme park genre it has become in these past years. Its plot is ultimately just filler and setup for the future causing antman and the wasp to be really dulled out characters. Jonathan majors as kang really stole the show, and did phenomenal though he did not feel like the right choice for the villain of this movie and should've been saved for a future film, cgi and blue screen looked bad at some points too just need more time in the oven. But in the end this movie is fun, funny at points not counting the corny Disney channel jokes, and has a great climax. Definitely not life changing but watchable for sure."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics have been too harsh.

Cons: cheesy at times, typical awkward teenage hero introduction, Paul Rudd humor a little suppressed(probably a reaction to Thor Love and Thunder's reception

Pros: Jonathan Majors is great, story is entertaining

Turbo-pros: the visuals and world-building are nuts"
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining and comical, cant wait to see whats next!"
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible ... que rayos con la actuaci√≥n de la chica 0 quimica
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Underwhelming watch, the movie got tons of action, the stakes are big, has a decent amount of humour too and is supported by a good star cast. While it checks most of the boxes it still felt meh, don't know why but maybe an oversaturation of MCU movies."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel is over.  Ant Man isn't even interesting!
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not a great story.  Mostly unimpressive acting.  The best scene was the one with all the Scott's from different realities, but that was about it."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,very fun.  at first i was skeptical of the quantum realm they created but I grew to enjoy it visually and conceptually.
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny and creative, yet sweet and foreboding. It's like a short, focused dose of Star Wars that doesn't take itself too seriously"
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You can tell that Marvel neither pays a decent amount nor gives proper timelines to the Visual FX team, yikes... (Also just a meh movie overall)"
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Demasiado lenta para m√≠ gusto , mala actuaci√≥n por parte de una actriz quiz√°s para una pel√≠cula hecha por Marvel su nivel estuvo demasiado bajo"
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies ever!! Definitely the best one so far this year.
One of my Favourite Marvel movies. Jonathan Majors was superlative, just awesome.
The Ant Family were also all awesome, the new Cassie did very well - Go Katherine.
This just proves that Critics do not know what they are talking about - never trust a bad rating from the critics as they are out of touch with what real audiences want and like. The movie was awesome - if I could give 10 stars then I would.
Bring on more Kang and more Marvel - Bring it!!"
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolutely one of the worst mcu movies. Derived close to no enjoyment. Will not watch again.
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, funny, jaw dropper, action packed, great visuals, amazing soundtrack"
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great Marvel Comic action movie! Paul Rudd was fantastic - never saw the first Ant Man movie.
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The Movie overall is entertaining and it's hard to argue that Jonathan Majors is an amazing actor. His performance is up there with some of the best big bands from all film franchises.
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked this movie better than any of the others.
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don't know what happend here
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was passed just right with the comedy, drama. and action. Getting to see the Quantum Realm from there point of view was awesome. So it must see beside the 1st ant man i think this is the best one as well"
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not the best MCU film but I had fun
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a good watch for Ant Man, but it was very cheesy. Kang was the best part of the movie though."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is a mid start to Phase 5, and the writing wasn't that good, but I do enjoy Jonathan Majors as Kang. A fantastic villain."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not sure why the critics review is so low. It was a fun and entertaining movie. Will not go down as some classic, but it is definitely worth watching as a movie for entertainment purposes. Would watch it agin unlike Thor 4 and Dr Strange 2. Actor playing Kang is definitely a big reason for the movie being good and gives hope for future movies he will be in"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a great introduction to Marvel Phase 5. It has its flaws with the humor and action but this overall was a great movie to watch.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Comedy: Perfect
Villain: Amazon!‚Ä¶ Great movie!"
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Movie is a mess. 
The daughter Cassie is that kind of quippy, annoying one-note character that's been done a thousand times by now, and her actress is changed from who she was in Endgame, who I think did a much better job. Jonathan majors as Kang is great but it does get a little tiresome hearing him speak in that same dramatic way over and over again. it started as super cool but got a little wearisome. Also, without spoilers, after seeing what happened to his most powerful version in Loki and what happens to him here, I'm not really feeling like he's the real genuine threat to everything they're  trying to hype him up as. 
Modak was cool but his arc makes no sense by the end;
The Quantum realm is just guardians of the galaxy /Thor love and thunder levels of weird that we've seen before, just not original at all which is sad, they could have made the place far more interesting than what it is here: just another wacky funhouse where the ""normal"" expectations are all inverted. 
I could say a lot more but I'm just bummed, I wanted so much more."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything that you want from a Marvel movie! Action packed and humorous moments. I really liked it and it deserves better ratings than it's getting.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Action and effects are awesome
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie. I kind of see what the reviewers saw. But it was a fun time. Full of great special effects and to see the quantum world come to life was fun. My kids loved it. So 5 stars.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I believe the critics are far too harsh on this movie.  Sure there are some uncanny valley moments with a particular character but overall the movie delivers on comedy, suspense, and action.  There is a lot going on in this movie and it references a lot of events of past MCU movies as almost all MCU movies do now. As such it helps to be familiar with the Infinity War saga and Ant Man movies."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"ƒ∞nanƒ±lmaz k√∂t√º bir filmdi. Hi√ßbir duygu imarisi yok. Karakterler √ßizgi filmden fƒ±rlamƒ±≈ü gibi. Yani ne yaralandƒ±klarƒ± ne √∂ld√ºkleri umrunuzda o kadar olamƒ±yor ki, √ß√ºnk√º √∂yle bir ≈üey olmayacaƒüƒ±nƒ± biliyorsunuz. K√∂t√º adam starwars'dan fƒ±rlamƒ±≈ü, yanlƒ±≈ü sete gelmi≈ü gibi. Paranƒ±zƒ± √ß√∂pe atƒ±n, bu filme gitmeyin."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang was kinda cool but not as good as I expected after watching Loki. The movie was boron at times but overall enjoyable. Just pretty meh.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I feel this is one the best Ant-Man movie I‚Äôve seen. Great special effects, entertaining, and had a story. Love it üòç"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super enjoyable.  I get that it's flawed in some aspects, but the imagery and sheer fu of it just made this a really enjoyable movie to be at."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-man is always nice. Good start for MCU phase 5.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think you guys need to drink the ooze I've seen this movie about five times in theaters and I just love it it's a great movie it's been along time since a  movie felt like a movie!  I feel like I was watching a movie from the late 90s early 2000s and I just love it it's not trying to do too much and it did just enough and at the end of the day it feels like a classic Disney movie that I grew up watching and I really appreciate that it's a good family movie it's a good movie.  I just love the dialogue. I love this mini episode of Rick and Morty or Brian and Stewie multi-verse travels the first 10 minutes of this movie Kevin!  can you please make Ant-man into a TV show.  doesn't need no crazy villains. Just Scott trying to get Cassie out of trouble them shrinking and growing things I would love to see that. Make it into a TV show please.  To me this movie was very psychological and I feel like it was messing with your senses on all aspects  visual to audio. The soundtrack is amazing, and why wouldn't he be there literally going into the quantum realm.  I have no issues with this film I've seen it a couple other times on some substances which made it even better I see a lot of complaints about the CG and I can't really see the complaints or why they have some with the CGi, looks good especially the quantum realm it just looks really really good I can't wait to sample it it's a really great film watch it. Buy it On  DVD streaming do whatever you have to do. This is the best Antman movie and this is the one of the best MCU movies in a while trust me also watch it on the big screen you can! Also also this completes the trilogy I feel like this is a great completion of the trilogy for Ant-man and his ark and everybody's again I just it's a good family film and I have no complaints I'll probably watch it a few more times in theaters"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"We really enjoyed this movie, Good story, plot, action, and special effects. Marvel did not disappoint!"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best of the Ant-man movies and Kang, Janet and hank steal the show!! The Quantum Realm is a great new universe to explore.  The story makes sense and has real stakes.  Don't miss out!!"
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cotton candy cute and cuddly! This is PG13 now? Wow. This one is under a ""G"" rating. At first, I thought the ""Star Wars'y"" quantum realm was cool. Then, I was SERIOUSLY expecting Spongebob and Patrick to show up and start farting at people. If you are a 4-year-old girl, you will enjoy this movie. This also explains the entire row of toddlers sitting in front of me with their mommies. I wish I was lying. I wanted to like this movie. My 13-year-old son said the same thing."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enough with the Critics! They're ruining the movie industry for their own inflated egos. The movie is definitely worth watching, it's unique and very entertaining."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I preferred Ant-man 2. Take away the newness of Star Wars-esque quantum universe and replace it with the real world. How would you rate the movie when you take away the CGI? What characteristics of the acting, script, and movie would you appreciate?"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Good to see those characters again. Liked to see MCU version of Kang
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"We took 5 people and everyone liked it! People have to quit comparing Marvel movies against each other, to me that makes no sense! It had action, humor without being cheesy like the last Thor movie, and I'm not sure what people are complaining about as far as CGI. Is everyone now an expert on CGI?"
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's a good marvel movie with every second of it being a great mix of action and comedy. It does an incredible introduction to Kang and leaves you wanting more
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was fun, visually beautiful, and introduces an amazing new villian in Kang. Jonathon Majors was absolutely amazing in the role. I could have done without the secondary villians redemption story arc that was made very comedic but that one issue aside I absouletly loved it and can't wait to see it again."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Esse filme tenta arduamente lutar pelo posto de um dos piores longas dos √∫ltimos anos da Marvel. Falha incrivelmente em tudo que tenta, n√£o aprofunda personagem nenhum e tira do foco daqueles que levam o nome do filme. Triste ver esse universo definhando dessa forma. A cena do Cassie dando discurso motivacional/ li√ß√£o de moral no MODOK foi uma das coisas mais vergonhosas que j√° vi. Nota: D√≥."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you were to look at a thesaurus, flip through the pages until you got to the letter 'M', and continue further until you reach the word 'Mediocre', you'd find 'Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania' as the most common synonym."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Aware that there was a lot of expectation on this film to deliver something far different from the previous two Ant-Man movies, and perhaps the ending didn't land as well with some people as well as it could - but I loved every minute of it. From the vastly different scope to the first two, I loved that they went BIG for an Ant Family movie. All the element were there for me. I've read some reviews saying there was too much exposition but I didn't feel overwhelmed at all. I thought it was a strong script and everyone delivered. My favourite of the three Ant-Man movies."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A little cheesy.  Had a bit more of a Star Wars vibe character wise and visually.  Not the best Marvel movie by any means, but a fun watch."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Did not like what they did with M.O.D.O.K
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"While not the strongest MCU movie - or even necessarily the best Ant Man movie - this does a great job of kicking-off phase 5, setting the scene for Kang as the new ""big bad"".  As with the previous Ant Man movies it keeps the humour going (albeit ""dad-joke"" level), and develops the idea of the quantum realm introduced in Ant Man 2 as well as exploring Janet Van Dyne / The Wasp's time there. I'm sure many wondered what (or who) she was doing for 30 years, now we know - Bill Murray!! :D Michelle Pfeiffer really expands into her role here and Jonathan Majors steals every scene as Kang.  The rest of the cast do sometimes seem to struggle to keep up.  Still - it's a great fun movie and bodes well for phase 5.  I remain somewhat baffled by many of the criticisms I've seen - I'm really not sure what people are expecting from an Ant Man movie, and for a movie that is at the very beginning of a new phase as opposed to the likes of Endgame which ended a decade of storytelling?"
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,I liked the world building. I disliked the cuts.
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The good - Johnathan Majors as Kang. He was phenomenal. 
The bad - Messy script, plot holes, ugly CGI, unneeded corniness that wasn't funny, and M.O.D.O.K who looked HORRIBLE. It was laughable at how bad he looked. 

The movie was entertaining, but don't expect Marvel Phase 1-3 excellence."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,what happened to marvel movies
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"First time watching a marvel film since the latest Spider-Man, this movie was awful terrible acting everything was a joke for a 10 year old girl"
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Oof....I miss the old Marvel movies when they cared about quality...
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just awful. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Boring, chaotic, terrible CGI‚Ä¶ I could keep going. I really like Paul Rudd, but this is not it"
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie does not stand on its own. The entire movie is one long after credit scene setting up future heroes and villains. The viewer is deprived a satisfying denouement with the promise of some future point where it will all ""make sense.""
   I used to really enjoy the characters of Dr. Strange, Thor, and Antmant. I'm afraid the MCU's last three entries have succeeded in extinguishing my interest in any of these characters.
   The actor who plays Kang does a great job."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania left many wishes unfulfilled. For a movie that is allegedly facing our superheroes against Marvel's next ""big-bad"" it seemed to lean heavy on comedy, but that's expected with an Ant-Man movie. The movie also feels hastily thrown into the Quantum Realm in a spur of the moment plot pivot not too far into the movie. Furthermore, the Quantum Realm in itself feels underwhelming. The CGI is good enough to tolerate, but when comparing it to other full-CGI worlds like Avatar, it doesn't blow you away. Lastly, our ""big-bad"" does not seem so bad after all. It often feels like our superheroes are not facing any true consequence except Kang escaping the Quantum Realm, and even if that happens, then what? 

Aside from the short-comings, this movie does offer exceptional action and adventure sequences. After all, they are in a complete ""alien"" world. The comedic relief is top-notch for a superhero movie, even if it seems out of place. This movie also does a good job as a introductory of Kang into the MCU, with a sneak peek of his variants' potential."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,It maintains the Ant-man formula. It follows the Marvel set-up without taking itself too seriously.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand all the hate - I had a blast - epic comic book story - completely took me away on a thrill ride.  Some of the jokes fell flat, but no where near as badly as Thor Love & Thunder. Can't wait to see it again."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was A very fun movie to watch
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you remind yourself that Quantamania isn't trying to be a cinematic masterpiece, it does have some enjoyable and humorous moments. The main cast do a good job, fan favourite Paul Rudd does what he does best along with Michelle Pfieffer and Jonathan Majors giving great performances. But with a lot of scenes feeling like they have been taken straight from Star Wars or Guardians, it makes you question whether the film was written as a parody and sadly overall feels dull."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the review bombers and uptight critics. This is a fun MCU movie, Antman films have always been light and a bit crazy, this one provides that in spades."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,An above average MCU movie. Not sure what the critics are smoking.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was, well, a good Ant-Man movie: funny, weird, fake-sciensy, and superheroes. I'm puzzled by the low critic score, like did they go into a superhero comedy expecting Bridge Over The River Kwai? I enjoyed the movie, had some popcorn, and look forward to what happens next with the Marvel storylines."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,interesting and active scheme
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I love Marvel comics the movie was overall great this is a must see.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie. The mini verse was lit and can‚Äôt wait for more
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie was legendary. Kang is the best villain ever. It was a thrilling insane experience.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really good! Alot of action and enjoyed a laugh from time to time!
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"To me, honestly it felt as disappointing as Eternals, but for totally different reasons. I felt the plot for Antman QM was just to heavily reliAnt  on CG, and in 3D the whole thing was just too damn dark.
 I think the previous Antman movies had a real light-hearted banter going on with their ensemble cast which was, for me sorely missing here. I read somewhere, before going to watch this, that Kang was even more frightening a villain than Thanos.... I said to my friend at the time 'well, that's a given as Thanos was a CGI character, you can't beat a real life actor onscreen' But I guess I was wrong, don't misunderstand me, Kang and the actor that played him was fine, but Thanos had real menace that was lacking in AQM. Over the years that Marvel has been releasing movies either through the MCU or Sony they have set a high bar, if AQM was the only Marvel movie out there and we hadn't seen any others it would be spectacular, but they set the standard for superhero movies and this just did not make it for me."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. Honestly was a bit worried because I loved how the first two movies were more street level super hero movies where it wasn't the fate of the world or galaxy on the line and was just a good guy trying to do the right thing. Also missed seeing Michael Pena and the ex-con friends as comedic relief, but can see how they wouldn't fit in to the plot. 
That being said I thought they did a good job of putting Ant-Man, The Wasp and the Ant-fam into a huge conflict with major consequences. 
Also really like the setup for more multiversal villains. 
Also not saying it was the best super hero movie or anything and I enjoyed the first Ant-Man movie more. There were a few goofy humor scenes that were a bit overdone, but didn't really take me out of the moment. Also thought Modok's design and character change was going to annoy me once I heard a rumor about it, but honestly didn't really mind it so much. The design was a bit goofy and wish they had made him a bit more intimidating, but thought it was a fun change to the character's origin and thought it was a fun swing on the fate of Cross. Also wasn't a villain I was ever all that attached to from the comics or games, so I can see where other fans might be a bit more critical of it than I.  

Also looks like another movie where the fans get to laugh at the out of touch film critics from looking at the reviews so far. also the reason I never look at ""Film Critic"" ratings anymore. If it is a film/series that is a genre or topic I am interested in, I look to see if the actual fans of said genre are enjoying it and completely ignore critics(maybe with the exception of Chris Stuckmann).  If those fans are bashing it, I will usually wait for streaming...unless it's a comic book movie then I go see it in the theater anyway."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,not bad just kang things
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it such a great film.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,If I had more thumbs...
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a really fun movie from beginning to end. It's a great start to Marvel's phase 5!
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, fits with the other marvel movies."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I agree the plot was a bit messy, but we  laughed a lot and it was much better than we expected!"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it all... it was an awesome movie.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie.  expected worse. but was pleasantly surprised with all the new characters, I enjoyed the humor, the story was great.  negative reviews are actually surprising."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it! It was the best movie ever
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I didn't love this movie, it follows the 80's TV show method of bringing in a kid to revitalize a dying platform. We went on cheap movie Tuesday and I feel like it was an appropriate price.. I would have been mad had I paid full price.

They made Ant man and The Wasp ancillary characters to the lame (new) daughter. Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang. They should have never replaced the original Cassie. The new girl crapped all over this movie.

Apparently this is the 1st movie they didn't have Paul Rudd co wright.. AND IT SHOWS. Basically, the movie is about the daughter making one terrible decision after another. Everyone we were with including my self hated the character at the end.

The other issue is again one of the worst thing about the 80's TV/movies. They drag out the reveal WAY TO LONG.. it was pissing off the entire audience (every one was talking about it as we left. Not even in our group just overhearing) Michelle Pfeiffer's character was constantly saying ""I'll explain later"" or ""we don't have time to explain"" it broke the first 2/3's of the movie. Add that with the kid making jerky decisions I understand why a lot of people say this movie sucked.

The savings Paul Rudd carrying this movie on shoulders, and some of the other cast, with an assists from the new girl. Katy O Brian she was actually a good character. She didn't suffer like all the new movies have now of ""So woke"" stuffing as many minorities as they can in a character just to show how ""with it"" they are, it takes you out of the movie.
I'm definitely not tired of super hero movies, I just wish they would have made a better reason to move the movie forward than how much the news daughter SUCKS.. 
Can't wait for Loki to come back! BTW I also thought Thor 4 was awesome!"
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,very fun good jokes cgi is ify at times but over all good time
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very interesting tie-in with the multiverse/Kang saga. Not the strongest Marvel movie, but overall a entertaining experience."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I entered the cinema with the certainty that I was going to waste my time, and I confirmed what I thought. The movie is just sad."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked the overall story line.  The visual effects were cool.  Not a fan of antman as a character. tired of the cheese, corny sayings.  make the characters do stupid stuff just to stretch out the movie.."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"dope movie, cool action fun to watch"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wonderful, definitely recommend. If you‚Äôre a big marvel fan and enjoyed the other movies you will enjoy this one"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand all the bad ratings. This is exactly what you expect from a Marvel movie, laughs, amazing effects and decent enough plot to keep you engaged."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, jokes were not funny, even credit music sucked"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,good  movie was not bad like what the critic says
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Remember, the critics aren't normal people with normal lives. They are critics always critical of everything. The verified audience tells the real story. Great entertaining movie for normal people to escape from their normal lives for a couple hours."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Typical, run of the mill post endgame marvel movie."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than the other two movies...
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are being way too harsh about this movie. They are comparing it to certain golden MCU classics and not seeing how much better it is than a lot of Phase 4 flops were. This movie recapture the childlike wonder and spirit I had when watching most of the classics from Phases 1-3. Paul Rudd was charismatic and likable, funny as usual as both Scott Lang and Ant-Man. Jonathan Majors was awesome. MODOK was amazing. The Quantum Realm reminded me of Andor meets weird and funky (in a good way) or the Cantina scene from A New Hope. So many great dynamics between pairings of individuals. A lot of laugh out loud moments, and awesome adrenaline choreography. 2 awesome post credits scenes. Great father daughter dynamic stuff that melted my heart as a daddy daughter. Loved it."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! I wish there was more of a background on Kang, but  I think this will be the connection to the new marvel movies."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Got back from seeing Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantomania, and to be honest, it was weird. I know it's meant to give the MCU's Post Endgame a new plot, but other than that, it's confusing. But when you watch it while you turn off critical thinking mode, you can sort of get a little enjoyment out of it like a guilty pleasure.

But that MODOK though... üòñ"
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun with lots of action. Great visuals.
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not the best movie I've ever seen
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is a good experience for people just going to watch a entertaining movie like myself. Majors is the standout in this movie, but the whole cast does their job. The criticism for this movie is crazy, and DOES NOT deserve a 48% rotten. I'd take this over dark world, L&T, Ant Man and the Wasp, Iron Man 3, and most of the disney+ shows besides Loki and Moon Knight."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Story, special effects, acting.. I don't understand the critics. This was a great movie. Looking forward to where they go with Kang!"
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"In my opinion, it was better than the multiverse of madness. Kang (Majors) is so expressionate, his performance and range are out of this quantum world."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Incoherent plot with no consequences or pay off
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action-packed movie, special effects are great, will thought out story, you'll get a few laughs out of it."
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I paid for Imax 3D Experience, but the movie wasn't 3D. We were given glasses, but they didn't make the movie 3D. Very disappointed"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing like every other Marvel movie.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Interesting development. Can‚Äôt wait to see the next installment
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a good fun movie, Some fun little twists in the story and an overall sound movie. Some good character development and a good introduction to Kang the Conqueror. 
Only questionable aspect was the cgi around Murdock looking a bit strange but overall it's worth a watch"
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie ruined the Ant-Man series
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is terrible. The plot is a mess and the writing is bad.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I registered specifically to write a review on this film. All the negative press and reviews excoriating it are total bull****. The MCU is getting too much unwarranted hate in general from the critics, probably because their high art can't compete (not that I'm saying there isn't a place for that). Grow up or go pick on something else. 
The actors were great, it was funny and action packed, it had heart, MODOK was amazing (hoping for more of him elsewhere), Majors nailed it as Kang, and the (spoilers) futuristic ant-army was a nice touch. My only critique is that some of the quantum-inhabitants felt more like sight gags than well thought out creatures (still‚Ä¶funny). The movie probably should have been about a half-hour longer as there was a lot to touch on. Looking forward to seeing what Jeff Loveless does with the Kang Dynasty."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best marvel movie in awhile, very entertaining, easy watch.  No clue why critics rated it so low, would see it again"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Surprised by the critic reviews. Great introduction to Kang! Top 5 marvel movies definitely.
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This review is really generous. No spoilers, but here is my take. .. It‚Äôs Antman and The Wasp. The Wasp was almost non existent and in no way was crucial to the Story Line. Cassie, the daughter, was given powers she didn‚Äôt earn or work for. No accountability or life lessons taught when immaturity reared its head. The plot was thin, and it really turned out this movie was a product placement to peddle a Marvel TV Show. Not great, not terrible. Just mediocre. Full of monologues and action sequences that don‚Äôt connect. I‚Äôm starting to lose patience with Marvel, seriously.."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly don't know what audiences (and especially reviewers) were really expecting. It's a Marvel movie! Something like number 31!  And we're now at the start of a new phase so the idea is to slow things down and gradually start to build back towards another epic climax.  Every movie cannot be Avengers Endgame! You simply can't maintain that kind of pace movie after movie. It makes no sense to do so. 
And this is an Ant Man movie - Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is a dad, so expect some dad joke level humour. But despite that - this movie still manages to create a whole new world (universe / microverse) which is gorgeous on screen! And it introduces us to Kang properly after Jonathan Majors brief welcome at the end of the Loki TV show. Majors of course does steal the show, although closely followed by Michelle Pfeiffer who finally gets her Wasp on as Janet Van Dyne. 
There are for sure things to criticise - but what do you expect? It's a comic-book movie, not Shakespeare! :D :D :D"
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"No es lo m√°ximo, pero no es tan mala como Eternals, se deja ver y por momentos es interesante. No me importa la reacion de los cr√≠ticos, si no, la de la audiencia."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was really good didn‚Äôt deserve a lot of the negative reviews that it got I think it just came out at a bad time in the MCU timeline deff a good watch
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,I should've went in with lower expectations!
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"February 17, 2023

If ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" was a TV series, one of its episodes might be something like ""Quantumania."" In other words, this second ""Ant-Man"" sequel is familiar, adequate, and fine in the short term, and because we suspect it will lead to something greater and more consequential later on, we can believe it has purpose. At the same time, as a standalone film, it's vanilla, it's what we expect, and it mostly plays things safe, so it's not exactly riveting. Although it makes for a nice, light distraction, we wish it was more than that. We want it to function as an exciting movie, not as a common episode of a potential TV show.

Not that ""Quantumania"" is a bad movie. In fact, we continue to care about the likable characters; the story has a great villain; the special effects are exquisite; and the whole production feels light and joyful. Where it falls short is in the number of surprises and complexity of the plot. This is the type of big budget blockbuster that we can step away from, come back to, and piece together too easily, and at this point in the (overly) stretched out Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) saga‚Äî""Quantumania"" is number 31‚Äîit shouldn't be so easy. We yearn for these movies to be deeper and more complicated, or at least entertain us in new ways. ""Quantumania"" is too complacent with being typical.

The movie catches us up with our Avenger friend Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a.k.a. Ant-Man, for the first time since ""Avengers: Endgame."" Scott walks merrily down the streets of San Francisco as John Sebastian's ""Welcome Back"" plays on the soundtrack and the ex-con turned superhero receives a plethora of friendly nods, winks, requests for selfies, and free gifts from passersby because everyone knows the integral role he played in saving the world.

Scott is a minor celebrity and he's recently written a book titled, ""Look Out for the Little Guy,"" and his breezy narration also gives us the latest on his girlfriend/superhero partner Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), a.k.a. The Wasp, her philanthropy, and their blissful life together (they often grab lunch atop the Golden Gate Bridge thanks to their power suits, which, together, allow them to shrink, grow, and fly). Life is good, but is Scott getting too comfortable? What's he going to do next?

That's the question his now teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) poses. Meantime, Cassie, in between her activist work, has been working with Hope's father, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), on engineering a device that can communicate with the Quantum World. The Quantum World, you'll recall, is where Hank's wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) spent 30 years before being found and rescued in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" (2018). When Cassie gives a demonstration of her invention, Janet pleads for her to turn it off, but it's too late: the whole ""Ant-Man"" gang is sucked into the Quantum Realm.

If you're a faithful follower of this series, you're probably already aware the Quantum Realm is not a welcoming place, although it's really neat to look at. As I mentioned, the movie's special effects are superb, and the actors blend seamlessly with the Realm's vast, colorful backgrounds, high-tech machinery, and digital characters, all of which render convincingly. 

Speaking of the digital characters, we get a kick out of the diverse creatures and humanoids inhabiting the Realm, among them Veb (David Dastmalchian), a pink, blob-looking alien with beady eyes and tentacle arms who dishes out red ooze, which foreigners such as Scott and Cassie can drink in order to understand the local language. There's also Quaz (William Jackson Harper), a cynical telepath whose head glows whenever he reads peoples' minds, which is something he really wishes he couldn't do; and Jentorra (Katy M. O'Brian), a formidable female warrior who leads this group of guerrilla rebels known as the Freedom Fighters, who've been displaced by the Realm's megalomaniacal ruler.

Said tyrant is Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who possesses unwavering ambitions to live up to his name and subjugate as many worlds as possible, although his exact motivations for doing so are never quite clear. However, with this being a Marvel superhero movie, we can chalk Kang's evil incentives to his being high on his own power and simply enjoying the practice of toppling peoples of all kinds. Crushing civilizations has sort of become his hobby and obsession. 

We know from the film's opening scene that Kang and Janet have a history, and we later learn Janet foresaw Kang's nefarious plans to use the Multiversal Power Core to travel across space and time and quell multiple dimensions. To thwart his schemes, Janet sabotaged the Power Core, and now Kang wants it restored. 

Eventually, Kang's newest weapon, a Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing, a.k.a. M.O.D.O.K., which is actually Darren Cross (Corey Stoll, semi-amusing) from the first movie reincarnated, captures Scott and Cassie, and Kang demands Ant-Man fulfill his demands to repair the core lest he kill Cassie. Meanwhile, Hank, Janet, and Hope seek the help of Lord Krylar (Bill Murray), Janet's former lover who's not so loyal to the rebels' cause. 

The various conflicts in Jeff Loveness' serviceable yet uninspired screenplay all come to an expected head, and we get the standard rebel uprising, extended battle sequences, final showdown, etc. I wish I could say there was more to ""Quantumania,"" but in the grand scheme of things, the movie, though well-produced, feels like filler. It contains some standout qualities, such as the upbeat humor and a strong performance from Majors, who makes for a threatening, charming, and eloquent villain (I suspect we'll see more of Kang in future Marvel movies), but it's mostly underwhelming. The action and events don't ignite us the way we hope a superhero (or any adventure) film will, and we watch ""Quantumania"" in a state of mind that's too laid back.

Have the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies finally hit their apex? With last year's messy and bloated ""Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness"" and ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" leaving bitter aftertastes, and now ""Quantumania"" being merely okay, perhaps it's time for the MCU to either take a break or pivot to a different formula. It needs to recharge because it now seems more common for these movies to bore us than grip us. Given the potential of their complexity, not to mention their budgets, these movies should be heavier, more involving, and, as the title of this latest ""Ant-Man"" installment suggests, manic."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great introduction of the Kang character into the MCU. The character's opening act in the LOKI TV series left a bit to be desired. But in the film, that was more than made up for in the level of menace the character deserved. Loved seeing Douglas and Pfeiffer as Hank and Janet Pym. They're great together.  Corey Stoll's MODOK was hilarious. But I always liked the character in the comics and he fit the part almost perfectly. I'd see it again."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the new castings.  Story line fot right in with previous entries in series!  Look forward to upcoming Loki series and Avengers movie to follow on this story!
"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lot of comedy unfortunately but Kang holds it down
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie HIGHLY reccomend! Very feel good story but with some scary tones from Kang, very worth the watch."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was a good movie. It's not the best of the 3, but still very enjoyable. who can't like Paul Rudd in anything. Along with Michael Douglas, it is a hit."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fresh, entertaining, a tad like SW or GOTG space look. A new universe to explore and discover. And Kang takes the stage for the next big baddie in the MCU."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"loved it! was it perfect? nope. and what the WHAT with m.o.d.o.k.?? but terrific narrative and damn, the multiverse visuals were INCREDIBLE, as was john majors throughout. they gave us just the right amount of paul rudd charm (it's potent stuff, use with caution), SOLID 2 hours of marvelous marvel."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Even if you don't mind some of the cringe and rough convenient parts, the plot and backstories weren't built well. The world wasn't really explained or explored at all. Things just kinda happened so it was hard to care about anything. There was also a lot of dumb plot armor just to make the story continue. The villain was also conveniently over powered or really weak when they needed it. Not even trying to hate but the film was executed poorly. Some parts were definitely enjoyable, but cheap plot armor and no development makes this film below mid."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. Saw it in theaters with my dad. My favorite movie of this phase
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,The story was decent. The dialogue was so clich√©. The special effects were great.
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love Paul Rudd as always and Jonathan Majors makes for a cool villain, but wow, the beats in this movie were well off. I'm normally really forgiving of movies and shows (I loved Netflix‚Äòs Iron Fist) and I love comics and superheroes, but this movie bored even me. It'll be interesting to see where it goes, but aside from Guardians 3, I'm not sure I'll bother to watch any more marvel films in theatres anymore."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was pleased with this movie. I feel it was a stepping stone for the next round of movies and shows more than anything. It could have had a little more in-depth story, but overall was enjoyable."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,The humour of Antman combined with the creative and zaney setting of the quantum realm makes this an experience like Guardians of the galaxy or Thor Ragnarok. Comedy is balanced well with the more serious villain we get in Kang
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was for all ages UNTIL a few minutes before ending they have to proclaim loudly the Lord's name in vain. Why and what did it add? So disappointing! Other than that. It's a Marvel movie that's very entertaining and great cinematography. I just would not take my children because of the unneeded outburst. Knock it off......
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie. Lots of action and I loved all the different creatures and the beautiful, stunning visuals."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang is the only actor in this movie. Others don't exist.
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good movie. It dragged at times in the middle but picked it up toward the end. It was a little too light-hearted at times. It was a good movie to watch, not great, but good."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is good! It didn‚Äôt disappoint, especially in 3D! Definitely looking forward to Loki season 2 and the rest of the MCU."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"At some points, I could understand why critics may have not liked this movie, however watching this movie after the heaviness of the latest avatar- this was such a great, fun movie to watch! If you go into the movie knowing it is somewhat of a filler movie to help set up an overall plot point for the next phase, you can learn to enjoy it quite well. It was very comedic in an almost childish way but I heard everyone in the cinema having a good time. Would watch again"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,A very average marvel movie with above average performances.
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can't understand why the ""reviews"" of this movie are so bad. It is another excellent MCU movie and it continues the excellent plot line from Loki. Jonathan Majors is FANTASTIC! And Kathryn Newton as Cassie is wonderful. I can't tell if she fits in well with as Kathryn and Paul or Cassie and Scott. Either way the duo on screen as father and daughter is fun to watch."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"It had its ups and downs but I absolutely enjoyed the movie, Kang definitely stole the show and I hope to see more of him !"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantamania feels very raw, it is supposed to be the entrance of a new phase of MCU but falls painstakingly short of being what it could have been, they should not have changed the ending. (Alleged) it feels weightless with the happy go round ending."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"the movie was really good, the look of the quantum real and quantum people was really good, also kang was a really good and menacing villain, there were many shocking moments throughout this movie that I really enjoyed, and the final confrontation was really good, overall I would give it an 8.5 out of 10, compared to other marvel movies"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie without memorable moments, kinda empty script and Kathryn Newton's performance left something to be desired, but Jonathan Majors' Kang manages to animate the film and hypes the next Marvel productions."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Favorite Marvel of the last 4-5 years!! As fun as guardians of the galaxy and just entertaining the whole way through and not sure why the ""experts"" hated it, yet another movie I seem to disagree with the elitist art school dropouts critical of anything that makes people laugh or smile as bad art, who only consider depressing and dramatic as quality. You will not be disappointed in this movie, it's the rare(recent) fun and understandable movie from the marvel brand"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was great kang was a great addition to mcu. But even tho I give 5 stars plz don't bring back modok
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't know what people are complaining about. The movie is highly entertaining. I rate this higher than Shang Chi because I didn't doze off while watching it.
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie changed my life. Before this movie my father was on his deathbed not responding, but then when I put this on for him he got up to turn it off"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was silly, but ok."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Replaces most of the charm and cleverness of the earlier films with hackneyed plot devices, and the increasingly prevalent problem of the entire universe being at stake‚Äîyet no one really feeling at risk (except for characters clearly included to be sacrificed).

Jonathan Majors was a highlight, though the incredible scope of his story was trivialized by expediting it through the lens of under-developed characters like Janet (though Pfeiffer did great with what she was given) or the refugees, while his powers were incredibly underwhelming (Got taken down by an ant stampede? Multiverse-brain genius couldn't solo Ant-Man?). Cassie is a one-dimensional macguffin. The verbal and physical comedy enabled by the first two films' supporting cast was badly missed. M.O.D.O.K. was the one truly strange thing the film offered, but his (again) one-dimensionality (I crave acceptance!) wasn't sympathetic enough to be meaningful.

The design and interactions in the quantum world were unimaginative (characters, landscapes, materials, physics all fairly Earth-like; creatures and aliens that, while occasionally neat, could have lived in any other sci-fi film). Distractingly inconsistent CG (par for the course these days)‚Äîit's a shame so much effort from an overworked industry was spent on this.

If there'd been more negative space, more slow, emotionally tonal moments (like Janet seeing Kang turn), contrasted with more creative and truly humorous moments (like the Ant-Man tower), and less bland fist+laser fighting, less trudging exposition, this could have been an interesting, weird, ominous, enjoyable film.

Compare the emotionally complex but simply illustrated bonding of Thanos and Gamorrah. Compare the fantastical and rollicking end fight in GotG2. With great reference within easy reach, it's a shame a movie so crucially positioned to support a larger arc missed out on its own worthwhileness."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good entertainment. Paul Rudd is awesome. Michelle Pfeiffer stole the show.
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie. 
It's looking like the MCU is getting back on track."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Typical Ant-Man humour as I liked it from the previous appearances of Ant-Man in the MCU. Interesting story. Amazing effects with CGI. Of course, that's not what the quantum world looks like but, let's face it, it is not a documentary."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"There's some storyline/plot issues and inconsistencies. Overall an enjoyable movie. Kang really carried the movie. MODOK was an interesting take on an absurd character. Not sure if I liked how he ended up, however. Marvel Movies has a bad rep of killing villains too early before they can develop."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best MCU project since Endgame IMO. Majors was awesome, movie was fun. Don't get the poor critic reviews!"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,I like my Superhero movies about the characters in the title...How can you have a superhero movie with the main character sucking so hard through the ENTIRE movie... having to be saved over and over again looking like a fool...and in the end... meh.... I wish Disney never put their hands on marvel ... :( ... also part of the reason why WB and DC don't gel...
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Let your imagination run wild!‚Äô
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The beginning of the movie felt very out of place and incredibly rushed. Cassie Lang was a very shallow character with only a few important lines. If they were attempting to set her up to be the next big hero, they failed. Some scenes were quite beautiful, and overall excellent CGI. Johnathan Majors was fantastic, can't wait to see more of him. Wish they could've shown how terrifying Kang was instead of just telling us. The ending was fun but at the same time pretty terrible. Hope future movies will have a more serious tone."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cheap jokes and poor character development make this marvel movie a painful experience. Majors was excellent but the character underwhelmed. Makes me reconsider my ""watch every MCU movie"" attitude.

Seriously this is DC Universe level status"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Efeitos especiais totalmente esquec√≠veis e sem profundidade, di√°logos fracos que tiram o brilho e peso da historia, a √∫nica atua√ß√£o memor√°vel √© o Kang que tem seu peso por√©m n√£o consegue salvar essa trag√©dia que √© Quantumania."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it very much. Truly a movie I expected to like and not even be disappointed at all
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Did you need more  abaut text marvel
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jokes didn't land. M.O.D.O.K. looked like a 5 year old learning CGI made it. Seemed like Paul Rudd was kept on a short leash creativity wise. Best thing about the whole movie was Jonathan Majors.
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Great cast, really awful movie, particularly the first half or 2/3s"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good and fun movie. Doesn't hit the highs of other marvel movies but enjoyable! Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd definite highlights.
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lackluster and boring. Had I not seen this movie, my life would've been exactly the same. Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania was a souless two hours and five minutes. The scrap-booking was rampant, making the editing look extremely poor and often times, I found myself just waiting for it to be over. This is NOT a good start to phase 5."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it! I don't get why so many ppl are hating on this film. Jonathan Majors is def the right choice for Kang and his variants. I thought MODOK's adaption in this film was a little silly but I still give the movie a 5-star. It may not have been the greatest film in the continuity of the MCU but this movie definitely hypes me up for what's to come with Kang's Dynasty. I loved the mid-credits scene with Pharaoh Rama-Tut, Immortus and Scarlet Centurion and then the counsel of Kangs!! Loved it!!! Then the second post credits scene as a sneak peak into Loki Season 2 with Victor Timely. So whats there to hate???"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,A kettle slow at times.
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story was on a basis towards reveal, giving us the viewers the suspense of ""Him"" which is stated about 5-10 times and after the many opportunities of explanation it was always interrupted which made it feel repetitive. There was 0 lack of humor and action and this introduction of depth towards Kang the Conqueror is excellent and excited to see Majors play this role more."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a very good movie. I do however feel that it was lacking in the action side of things. Very cute and would recommend to another
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Insufferabley long and boring. No humour. A turgid plot that was just an excuse to put together masses of stunts. I left before the end and didn't care what happend to anyone of the characters. This film requires huge amounts of bladder control if you want to see it on one sitting....
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Watch Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) Full Movie >>> CINEMASTAR.SITE
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lifeless and lazy. The MCU is definitely suffering from exhaustion. Too many projects means quality control has hit an all-time low with everything from storyline to visuals. 

After watching the Rings of Power, MCU CGI just feels cheap and lazy. Jokes are stale and quite frankly, inappropriate for the target audience (is this a superhero movie or a episode of Trailer Park boys?).  Jonathan Majors as Kang is the film's only saving grace but isn't given any sort of development on screen. And even the movie's Headliner, Ant-Man (by no fault of his own of course), is no longer given a chance to charm us with his quirks. 

This was a movie solely meant to be a stepping stone onto the next 5 movies and not able to stand on it's own. Take away all the Easter Eggs and references to future movies and what you're left with is an empty shell that crumbles like the rotten egg that it is. 

Save your money and time and watch a YouTube breakdown instead. At least more effort gets put into those things."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Acheio filme super interessante. Como os filmes da Marvel est√£o com hist√≥rias cada vez mais complexa achei super tranquilo sobre o fatos do filme ter poucas cenas de a√ß√£o e mais cenas com explica√ß√£o, fez com que a hist√≥ria tivesse mais nexo, mas ainda assim √© um √≥timo filme"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"More of the same, if you miss this movie you won't miss anything at all."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang is a great character I can't wait to see him in the MCU but there's just to much going on here.
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it....got straight to business too. Def a must see
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!  It A-/B+ marvel story.  It was not meant to be light and airy like the first two.  The critics need to take the stick out of their ass!
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Majors is very good in this, and very undervalued......huge issues were ...mordok...is that the right spelling (who cares)....it was a crash course...was it supposed to be funny?"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just didn't keep my attention like the other Ant-Man movies did. Not quite sure why.
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As a marvel fan, this help to explain the quantum realm. I kept expecting to see Dr. Strange!"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not the best Marvel movie, but by far not the worst.  Decent bits of humor and a I guess a good prologue for the Phase 5 arc to introduce Kang.  Ant Man definitely suffers from not having his side crew who are the real funny people in the previous movies, and not sure if his grown up daughter could be any more annoying."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,MODOK is so cute and funny
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great visuals and plot twists at times. Sometimes, the answer the public is seeking is long to get, but they are complete. We get a good glimpse at Kang's power inside the Quantum Real even though he can't have his full powers."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had a lot of fun with this, doesn't waste much time getting into things. I did feel like they dragged out the reveal of Kang quite a lot but I spoke with my wife about this who is very much less in the know about these types of things and she said that this actually worked for her. I think this is a very solid entry in the MCU and sets up Kang to be potentially be the MCU's best yet. Very excited for what's next"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm totally amazed at the critics score versus the people who pay to watch it.
The critics job is to advise the general public by objectively watching a show and working out what they may like not try to poke holes and knock something just for the hell of it.
I enjoyed it, I left my brain in the foyer and went on a ride. 
It's not the Shawshank redemption, it's a Marvel movie. 
I got what I paid to see. 
It's not as fresh as the early Marvel movies but that's because we're used to them now.
It's not perfect, there may be the odd plot hole but don't question it too much and enjoy!"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it - the characters were compelling, the villain impressive.  The bad press is overblown"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,marvel is falling apart
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is the pre-cursor to make Kang the next Thanos. It might not be as funny as the previous one, but with good reason as they concentrate more on Kang. It's a great movie considering the overall big picture."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Unexistent world-building. Again Marvels leaves you with more questions than answers. Power gaps between heroes have 0 consistency. Is Khang supposed to be the new Thanos? Totally forgettable.
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A hard to follow plot , far to much going on to even make it half interesting, we were going to leave about 3/4 the way through but perserved to the end, I think if anything it damaged my previously high rgeard for Ant man and his team , glad to get home"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't fret, Marvel fans! (Should be 4 and a half stars). The reports of Phase 5 stumbling out of the gate is... perplexing. ""Quantumania"" is a fantastic third Ant-Man movie in its own right, and as for properly introducing the next Big Bad, the crew behind the MCU have knocked it out of the park. Cannot wait for what's next!"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang The Conqueror is a savage
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was great, it sets everything in motion for the kang dynasty and loki"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie was alright, pretty empty theatre though. Definitely would've kept my money and spent it on a different movie. I don't recommend seeing it in theatres if you have Disney plus though. Mcu needs another big hit movie or bring back iron man somehow to revamp the mcu."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was boring. I kept wishing it were over, then faking sleep, waking up and wondering why it was still going."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great cast and compelling story but it's bloated with CGI and feels very Phantom Menacey at the end. Jonathan Majors is fantastic as Kang!!
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly Love this movie, It Was a Great film and Was Very interesting!
lots of things I wasn't expecting to happen.

my Girlfriend didn't like a lot of the Dirty jokes and said it was alright (She would give it 3 1/2 stars)

it gives Ant man a good Movie to shine in, Facing someone who beat our other heroes so much."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dear Critics, you've missed the mark. I thought this movie fun. That's why I went to see it; for entertainment. I there were so many of you saying it was trying too hard to be funny. I thought it was. This movie delivered exactly what I thought I was going to get. The scenes were beautiful. The Villain  gripping. I thought the plot was ok, better than some I have seen lately (Avatar I am looking at you.) Make mine Marvel"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sometimes the ratings are lower then the actual movie should be. This was and I quote: ""a marvel/starwars/star trek fans litteral wet dream""

My heart was racing multiple times during this movie. I cried some and had proud moments along side the ""wait WHAT"" moments. 

I'm in the theater right now waiting fir the end credits as I'm typing üòÜ this really was worth it‚ô°"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Very funny and entertaining.
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,It felt little more like watching a Star Wars movie but wasn‚Äôt horrible
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Love Jonathan Majors Kang. The quantum realm story was begging to be explored in previous movies and I loved the world within a world and Janet's PTSD. Kang feels like a huge threat to the MCU.
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"From beginning to end I was enjoyed.  The Quantum realm was a whole new world to explore in the MCU. Scott and Cassie's relationship is great. Kang is awesome, can't wait to see more of him. Great intro to phase 5. I've seen every MCU movie a few times , and I'll watch this one many times as well."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Such an unnecessary film! This new villain isn‚Äôt even worth it. Terrible, terrible film!!"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel needs to go home 
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It was lots of fun and had a lot of great moments‚Äîloved it!
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"What an amazing ride.  A shame people cant stand watching so much CGI for so long.  This was a visual masterpiece, and I could have watched another 1-2 hours of seeing artist‚Äôs imaginations.  Hilarious that reviewers said they couldn‚Äôt understand it.  I mean what is there to understand? Appreciate the imagination on the big screen."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't understand all of the hate. I loved this movie! Jonathan Majors as Kang was incredible. The dude genuinely came off scarier than Thanos!
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Next to Thor: Love and Thunder , this movie was Citizen Kane. The storyline was easy to follow, and a convincing new villain (Kang) , really helped buoy the movie along. Only drawback was the new actress for Cassie (not convincing)"
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is an exciting movie that raises the stakes for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story follows Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne as they battle against a powerful villain from the Quantum Realm. The movie features an all-star cast, including Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly reprising their roles as Scott and Hope, as well as Michelle Pfeiffer and Laurence Fishburne joining the cast as Janet and Bill Foster respectively.

The action sequences are exciting and the special effects are top-notch. There are some great moments of comedic relief, which is something that only a movie like Ant-Man and The Wasp can provide. The performances by all the actors involved are excellent, and the overall chemistry between the characters is one of the best I have seen.

Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is an exciting film that pushes the boundaries of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action, effects, and performances are all top-notch, and it is definitely a movie that you should check out if you are a fan of the series."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall entertaining. Felt like Kang's takedown could've been handled better. Cool concepts were introduced that'll hopefully be expanded upon in the coming movies/shows. Didn't get enough on Lang's story, but it looks like we'll get it in Loki season 2. Hopefully this'll be one to rewatch next year once we're through phase 5."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,A visual effects extravaganza with a lot of fun! What else does a super comic lover need? The next Marvel Universe Phase is HUGE! I can't wait!!
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"It‚Äôs a fun movie and good action, I love this movie "
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very good but was very skewed in action most of the action was at the end of the movie but still would recommend
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,My son suggested a father and son day. He wanted to see puss & boots. We ended up seeing Antman.  We both thought it was great. Opens up the storyline I think it will get better and better. Ready to see the next movie in the MCU universe.  Bring it on!
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Scott Lang, Hope Van Dyne, and Doctors Pym and Van Dyne did amazing!!  yes, I left the daughter out of this review because the actress I do not like at all.  I first saw her in SUPERNATURAL and she played the annoying, rebellious, and too big for her britches kid/daughter.  She just made me mad everytime she opened her mouth in the movie.  I was so upset when I found out she replaced the other teenage Cassie from Endgame.  However Ant-Man, The Wasp made a terrific duo and I hope we see them again.  Kang delivered an incredible performance as the new major Villain for the MCU."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie, so what's all the fuss? it was worth the ticket price. Remember the best review is from those that see it. It's better than both previous Ant-Man movies and sets up the next stage. For those who compare it to The Eternals you must have missed the movie."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Loved Kang, but weird movie. I felt claustrophobic."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Liked the actors but plot was a little too far out there and had too much futuristic stuff
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was good, will watch it again, however, didn't care for the sneak peak after the credits."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Why does M.O.D.O.K. look exactly like Mr. Electric from Sharkboy and Lava Girl 3D?
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Didn‚Äôt feel like an Ant-Man movie, but not in a good way. This film made me feel less excited for Kang as the ‚Äúbig bad‚Äù of the next phases because he‚Äôs just a guy who can be beat by ants. No intimidation to the guy."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was amazing I loved the fight scenes and Kang was just fantastic! this was a nice
start for phase 5 I think this is the most underrated movie! 

U have to see this"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It was funny and entertaining and loved the main cast. Just a smidge too long for the story line.
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rather than the critics, it was a pretty nice movie and do not deserve this hate"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"A grand Kang story in line with what you would see in the comics, while expanding on the idea of the quantum realm."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was typical of Marvel movies, excellent. I really enjoyed it, lots of action. The theater was not crowded which was great for me. I have not been to a theater in a few years and realized that around noon is the ideal time for me to go."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Only Jonathan Majors brought his A game.
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it, but I can see why some people are disappointed in the outcome."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While a decent movie, it felt more like a Star Wars movie than a Marvel movie. It lacked the comedy of the first two Ant-Man movies. Jonathan Majors as Kang is a welcome addition to the Marvel Universe."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,I am fine it I am fine with Paul I am fine with Michael I am fine with Kate from Lost I am fine with Michelle and I am not fine with MODAKs design!
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a lot of fun and a great time overall. I definitely felt some inspiration from Star Wars and it definitely had a Sci-Fi feel. Paul Rudd was great as Ant-Man which was to be expected, but, Johnathan Majors as Kang was amazing. Kang was gritty in a way which isn't usually expected in a marvel film and he felt on the same level of power and pure wickedness as Thanos."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is funny, visually stunning, and Jonathan Majors really delivers; he has me looking forward to future installments in the MCU. Beyond that this isn't a truly game changing film like we have seen over and over from Marvel, but diving into the quantum realm is still a great time."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it.  Post credit scenes were üî•
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, this is just a fun, silly, and sometimes touching, romp through the multiverse.

While this certainly isn't the best film ever released by Marvel it is, wholly, a fun yarn with just enough action, comedy, and character to keep you engaged from start to finish.   

Kang (Jonathan Majors) is brilliant in this film; giving a performance that has depth and complexity despite the ""bubblegum"" subject matter.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this performance given the previous ""Loki"" interpretation - which I felt lacked the necessary intensity. 

Casey Lang (Kathryn Newton) does well with writing that is on-again/off-again.  Her performance is sincere, but I get the sense that some of her best stuff is sitting on a cutting room floor somewhere.   There are some really good character development moments early on that are squandered with some odd editorial choices and flat writing.  Nonetheless, she and Rudd build a degree of believability in their relationship that gets you to care.

Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) really gets the short-end-of-the-stick in this script.  While she has iconic ""hero moments, those moments are book-ended with lackluster dialogue that is flat and uninteresting.  There are times when she feels like an afterthought - and that's just not deserving of an actress and character as strong as she is.

Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) is the break-away character in this story.  Her motivations are constantly in question and her experiences shadowed in mystery that comes across in a strong performance the overcomes some ridiculous situations in the script.

Bill Murray's cameo lands as oddly as his persona - is he supposed to be funny, weird, odd, or sinister?  Frankly, the more I reflect upon his performance and the material, I think Murray's character served well to establish the desperation Janet felt all those years abandoned in the multiverse with little prospect of getting home to see her loved ones.

Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) is positioned very awkwardly at the beginning of the movie with stilted dialogue and interactions with the other cast members that feel like poorly edited reshoots taken out of context.   I do NOT think this is Douglas' fault, but rather poor editing or writing.  By the end of the movie, Douglas' character finds it's swagger and firmly establishes it's reason to be in the film. 

MODOK (Corey Stoll) reprises his roll as the foil to Scott Lang's quintessential (Paul Rudd) ""good-guy"" persona.  Perhaps the most refreshing characterization I've seen in a while in a Marvel movie, MODOK goes on a very interesting journey that is actually, in a moderately gross and sophomoric way, kind of heartwarming. 

Overall, I recommend the movie.  It's a bit wobbly at the beginning, but if you've watch Loki or any of the other movies trying to explain the idiosyncrasies of the multiverse, you'll be able to keep up with the onslaught of technobabble at the beginning over the film.  By the time you ""drink the ooze"", you'll forget that you can't follow the math, and just go along for the ride. 

Good fun.  Go watch it!"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it!worth watching in theater.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Joke movie. Can't take nothing serious in this movie, i didn't know that this was a comedy"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was exciting and funny and, I mean, Bill Murray! C‚Äômon!"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,descent movie just felt like it could have been more to it
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,The marvel formula is extremely stale at this point. Enough with the ridiculously silly humor. Marvel hasn't been good since End Game
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very entertaining and fast moving.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Considering I hated Ant-Man 2, I came into this one with very low expectations. I actually thought it was a lot better than the second one. Thought it was fun being in the Quantum Realm for the entire film. I was also getting heavy Star Wars vibes between a cantina scene, different species, and a similar ending to Rise of Skywalker. Majors was great, as he is in all roles. The reprise of a character I won't name was also hilariously done. Overall, it's still not great, considering how the finale battle gets played played out, and Disney using a very similar formula we've already seen. But, Quantumania is still way more watchable than the previous film."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The visual was amazing üëè üòç ‚ú®Ô∏è
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun adventure through and through. Jokes personally didn't ruin important moments for me. When tense moments hit, it was unnerving. I understand some complaints to be had, but I feel what the film addressed here purposefully held back the full terror we've yet to see of Kang's era, but even then what he displayed here was terrifying. So, I'll be waiting patiently as phase 5 pieces together what the multiverse opens up."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"3D was amazing really made the movie incredible.Paul Rudd is great as Antman, his daughter, Lily, Douglas, Pfiper what can I say? It was a great trip!"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania delivers on many levels as one should expect a superhero movie to do - provide colorful action, a story that makes sense (in the context of the Marvel Universe), consistent and relatively comic book accurate characters, and decent acting. This movie delivers all that and more.

Are there moments where the lines could have been a little sharper - yes. 
Are there instances where the humor (e.g., Bill Murray's lines) fall a little flat - yes.
This does not make it a bad movie, it just changes the overall rating from 5 stars to 4.
Unlike Quantumania, Black Adam was a disappointing, poorly executed, poorly written and poorly acted superhero movie with few exceptions. Thor: Love & Thunder was a poorly written execution of a great story and riddled with seemingly forced injects of humor that compromised that story, the acting, and the focus of the film.
If you like the Ant-Man character, this is a late blooming coming of age story that chronicles the transformation of Scott Lang from what he has said he is [an Avenger], to what he needs to be - a serious stand-alone hero who takes himself a little more seriously now.
In addition, you get Jonathan Majors who is excellent as the multi-faceted, charismatic, and villainous Kang. A phenomenal actor on so many counts.
Overall, well done. I can't wait to see what comes next."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"this was without a doubt the worst Marvel movie to date. I never realized what a horrible actress Michelle Pfeiffer is, and the guy that plays Kang is equally as terrible. The scenes with the two of them are some of the worst and most painful to watch I have ever seen. I really wanted to walk out of this movie."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This particular series standing alone has been entertaining yet never with the heft of some of the other storylines.  Marvel lite if you will.  And I‚Äôm not sure I feel differently about that now, but it‚Äôs a must-see if your a fan because of course it launches the next phase and brings in the new villainous threat.  And it is entertaining.  I had fun watching it snd I‚Äôm pumped for what comes next to the multiverse, so that‚Äôs a mission accomplished."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"First half sets up a lot of interesting concepts that unfortunately end up being unfulfilled in the second half. The writing also sees a noticeable dip in the third act. Jonathan majors carries his scenes although even the use of Kang disappoints in the end. The most memorable Ant-Man, but not all the memories are good ones. 

Also... they should create a new cut that just does not include MODOK."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have now seen this film twice and honestly can't see how it's gotten bad reviews. It's a pretty good movie that has a bit of Paul Rudd's charm and the cheesy ant man style fights. Sure it's not iron man blasting through things and it's not Captain America chucking his shield around but it's still good and sets up the bad guy in cinemas, my only major complaint would be two nice plot points to tie in where it's going in the films and in the TV shows are end credit scenes, I guess I can see why as it would be hard to of tied them into the film, but not everyone wants to wait till the end of the very end credits to see another plot point. Otherwise the film itself was a great addition. Far better than eternals, ten rings, Thor 1 and 2 and captain marvel."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it. But a great villain.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The only decent part of this movie was Jonathan Majors. The writing was piss poor. Deciding to bring MODOK into the film was a god-awful decision, and the dialogue his character was involved in was cheesy and clearly designed only to play toward the children's audience.  The whole premise for how the conflict came about is garbage -- if the danger from Kang / the quantum universe were so clear and present, there's not a chance in hell Janet wouldn't have been more specific with her quantum universe-researching husband and daughter. The whole plot depends on stupidity from her character, and that makes for terrible writing."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was somewhat goofy, but respectable for an Ant-Man movie. However, I didn't appreciate the forced social agenda being pushed onto the audience. The CGI effects were passable for a low-budget 2023 Marvel movie, except for Modok, which was very poorly animated and rendered. The villain played by Jonathan Majors was the best part of the movie."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good Marvel movie, correct CGI and the best from the Ant-Man series!. Don't understand how the critics punished this movie and, for and instance, poor products such like Ms. Marvel, She-hulk or even Black Panther could have more than 90% of acceptance‚Ä¶ no way!"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"this is one of the best marvel movies ive seen in my entire life and is more meaningful thematically to the important things in life than most media, i imagine most critics of this movie dont understand art, thought ""not enough kang"" and have an inability to comprehend reality."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Forced to watch with my younger cousin and have to say, L movie. Very forced humor and a forgettable plot. Just rewatched The Batman and... no comparison at all. The MCU is dead give up. DC on the other hand
..."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a good start to phase 5 and Kang himself was the best part of the movie!
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was well done except for a few things. (1.) It takes too long to get to the Quantum Realm. (2.) They make the Quantum Realm appears as a place similar to a mixture of Star Wars/Mad Max. (3.) The Bonus Ant-Man scene at the end could have been better for the phase that the MCU is in. Still a pretty good movie. justmy2cents
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it even more than black panther 2 probably because Im not a critic
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The is called the Antiman and the wasp it is very and I like the show I did like all of it from the beginning and very very end the show was so good thats what I like to say.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Dope movie! The best Antman movie.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I walked out on the 1st Antman. I dozed off a couple times on the 2nd Antman. This 3rd one was better than the previous ones. I was engaged the majority of the time. I appreciated the world created in the quantum realm. A lot of time and attention to detail was given and the CGI was much better this time around. I will say that I saw this one in 3D and 4DX, so I may be biased a little. 4DX makes everything better. Frfr. The easter eggs are awesome. Can't wait to see the variants in the follow up films!"
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, tons of unnecessary characters that didn't even make you feel nothing for them, and they expect us to get excited at a final battle copied from Star Wars 8."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"good overall, a few cheezy lines at the begining"
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Roteiro bem fraco e personagens com motiva√ß√µes razas.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,The trailer is way more entertaining.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie and have always been a fan of the Ant Man cast! In my honest opinion, I think they should have went with the original Cassie they casted for Endgame, instead of re-casting Kathryn Newton. She did great! Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy her as Cassie, but there were some questionable scenes where it seemed like either she was trying to hard or the writing was for her character. Either way, the movie was great, everyone did amazing! The post credit scene was AWESOME!!"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of fun. Enjoyed it in 3D. Don‚Äôt pay attention to the negative reviews by critics. Just go, relax, have some popcorn and have some fun."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It had more plot holes than swiss cheese, they abandoned all of the rules previously established, and made a mockery out of the quantum realm"
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania is a departure , IMO, from the tightly scripted , ultra CG, incredible special effects wonderhorse that was the Marvel Universe . It attempts to recapture some of the original fascination for the microcosmic world (ant & wasp)that exists under out feet and all around us. Unfortunately without someone at the helm who mastered the product in the past (I.e. Stan Lee & assoc) the movie misses the mark . I'd recommend this movie for comic fans not completely invested in past Marvel megahits like Avengers , Hulk , Captain America etc.. Also I would recommend it for kids under 12 because they've likely not seen the full biology class and Immediately recognize the absurdity of a micro-jelly figure who speaks about being excited to have ‚Äòholes' after being shot a dozen times . Just shoot me Marvel if you're going to flush the Stan Lee playbook! Thank you"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good. I don't know why it's getting so hate.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was a spectacle to watch and setup the next phase of the MCU. Over time, I believe it will be more important as storylines spin off the events of this movie. I think the backlash is more of a testament to Marvel world building than the quality of the movie."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"good story, Visually stunning."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,By far the worst Marvel movie I've seen. Complete mishmash of a plot in the quantum realm.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"computer graphics was awesome.   great to see it in 3-D.    first half a bit cliched, but last half hour awesome"
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible experience.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I would have given this movie a higher score if it didn't get political. Seems Disney can't keep its own beliefs to themselves. The movie had two specific scenes of socialism good capitalism bad.  Other then that the movie was fine. The standouts were Paul Rudd who always plays the part so well and Michelle  Pfeiffer who looked amazing and played her role also.  The movie did get slow to me at one point but it picked up again. Loved the suprise cameo, he always lights up the theatre.  I don't have to explain why Disney is trying to influence a generation politically to my children. They point it out to me, maybe this is backfiring on them because it's frustrating to them as well."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It feels like they threw this together and were like ""We will SAY Kang is a big threat, and figure out how this is true later."" 
He doesn't seem like a real threat, this movie was bloated and horribly written, don't even get me started on the CGI. 

Is this even Antman anymore? So many other character spend too much time stealing screentime from the main protagonist. Every marvel movie these days feels like an Avengers movie because they are so bloated with characters and rarely focus on the main protagonist"
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Only redeeming qualities are Ant-Man, Kang, and the CGI. The first half is a snore, to many characters were introduced that we don't care about, disappointing end fight with Kang, and more!"
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Guys, I want to watch a comedy! Do you know what we should watch? Ant-Man Quantumania! Wait, isn't that like, a Marvel action movie? Yeah, it was supposed to be...but like, it was so bad you can't help but laughing at it. For example, Darren? Horrible design, yes, but entertaining, to watch, of course. If you want to enjoy making fun of something, I definitely recommend this movie."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics can suck an egg! It was a delightful movie that leads to much larger events that are coming down the line.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I have little hope that Jeff Loveness, a man who has only written Rick & Morty and Jimmy Kimmel episodes prior to Quantumania, could write a script for Avengers: Kang Dynasty that will be any good."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie does not fulfill my expectation, it made a big entrance but take a backdoor exit and make me question ""what?"" pretty much entire movie. There is also no memorable event for me and the mood during the movie was not flow smoothly. 
This sequel Ant-Man is different from the first two that has significantly increased the scale of the movie. The attraction of Ant-Man was being a family, comedy, action, superhero but this time it came back as a prelude of the 5th phase of the MCU. Also, the theme has changed from family, espionage into adventure, action, fantasy. There are many elements to present in the movie; family problems, Janet's secret, powerful villain and new society in the new universe. Since the purpose of the movie has prioritized to present the story of the quantum universe, the family relationship part of Cassie and Scott was dropped and not clarify enough for me to have an emotional feeling with when it comes to the critical point. About another family, Janet's secret. Her reason of completely keeping everything from quantum universe with herself was not strong enough for me to agree with. Why she would like to keep this big multiverse threat with herself or she had no shame on what she has done with those people down there? For the villain, Kang had a strong plot and back story of how powerful he was but the end of him was too easy by giant ants army that their origin still unclear to me. Another villain character, M.O.D.O.K. This character was pretty much a joke character which his personality kind of nicely place in the movie. But the reason of his intent still did not make sense to me, due to how he was in the previous movie. At the end, his reason to compromise also still weak. For the worldbuilding presentation, if what the movie presented is to imply this universe, then it works well and I really hope to see more about it. But if this universe does not do anything more in MCU, I would like to say that I will be disappointed because this movie did not introduce it well to me to acknowledge about this realm. I assume that there were too many things to cover within very time limit so everything in the movie went pretty fast and sometimes it instantly changed the mood which make me stumble a bit during watching. 
I appreciate how they do the computer graphic and the design of structures, creatures and environment are pretty interesting. I wish they can introduce this realm deeper and will play a big role in MCU. The best part of the movie is the actor Jonathan Majors, the way he expressed his feeling can tell everything about him, what was his perspective on his doing or how heavy his duty was. And he will be playing many more roles in the MCU, I am looking forward to see him playing different personalities in the next sequel."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,someone needs to invent a pair of glasses that will read subtitles! with all the background music and noise it was very difficult to hear the dialog. My wife tried to help me but I couldn't hear her either. I have tried the theater ear things but they do not work!
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Big problem of this movie, its the so call disney formula."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"After initial adjustment to Ant-Man cojoining Star Wars bar-scene filmed within a kaleidoscope, it was an enjoyable flick.  Not as good as 1 or 2, but better than some of the latest Marvel releases."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was sooooooo borrrrrrred during this whole movie. Plot was super dumb. I hate when movies make characters dumb just so that they have a reason to move the plot forward, oh! and also, the super super easy ""coincidences"" just make this movie feel so shallow and absolutely boring."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel Studios placed a high standard with Infinity War & Endgame and has not been able to achieve the same level of quality since then, now we the audience are so used to the same formula that it's hard for us to think anything is remotely good, which is a problem for this movie and the ones coming.

It works well as an introduction to the next phase and the new enemy, is not as good as the first one but accomplished the goal. The visual effects are not the best but not the worst as some people claim, the movie is entertaining, visually attractive, and the story flows quite smoothly without feeling like a waste of time... hard to believe it, but it's worth a watch if science fiction and Marvel are your thing"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Oh my God, what an enthusiastic start to the new phase of the Marvel world. I miss this great atmosphere of enthusiasm. I really enjoyed every scene in the movie, and I hope that Marvel will continue to present this content."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel is getting weirder with each movie. All the different species in this movie reminded me of Star Wars. I wish I would have waited for it to stream.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Anyone who loves movies knows a good movie is story driven.  The producers of this movie made a Jurasic Park decision to forego any kind of story line, in lieu of special effects.  The quantum world is beautiful, it would help to have characters and a story line worth watching.  Sadly ,this film is simply a jumble of things, a big fat mess.  At times ridiculous, at times it tries to be funny,  it attempts to capture Star Wars, etc etc.  What a waste of money and talent!"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"There are times and it's rare but I agree with the critics. Then there are many of times like this where I completely disagree, I enjoyed this movie very much. From this slew of Marvel movies I enjoyed this with Shang Chi and Spiderman No Way Home. It was funny, entertaining and Sci fi. It was my favorite Ant Man of the three. I'm glad I don't listen to the critics and go for myself to see."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome. Cross between marvel and star wars on alien planet
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's not an Avengers End Game, for sure, but works well as a set up for the next Big Bad.  Plus, it's an Ant Man movie so it's going to be quirky and humorous.  I did miss Michael Pena, however.  He added a lot to the humor of Ant Man movies."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it. Was it their best movie? No. But it was different and comic-bookish. People act like every new Marvel movie needs to be Godfather 2 otherwise things are falling apart. Relax and enjoy it. Overly harsh critics who just want marvel to fail and go away need to get over it. They say it after every movie now ""Is this the end of Marvel and the superhero craze?!"" No. As I said, get over it. It was better than any of the other movies I've seen this year."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun and exciting world to see
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Ant-Man et la Gu√™pe: Quantumania"" s'agit du trente-et-uni√®me film de l'univers cin√©matographique Marvel et du troisi√®me film ¬´ solo ¬ª mettant en sc√®ne le personnage d'Ant-Man et La Gu√™pe. J'ai bien appr√©ci√© ce film avec toujours des personnages attachants, les sc√®nes d'action sont bien sympas et les effets sp√©ciaux sont plut√¥t convaincants. La premi√®re moiti√© du est un peu long a se mettre en route puis la seconde partie est √©poustouflante digne d'int√©r√™t."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie does not deserve all the negative criticism. I thought it was the perfect balance of humor and drama. Sure, the whole movie is a massive CGI experience, but that didn‚Äôt bother me one bit. Overall, the acting is great, there‚Äôs typical humor found in Ant-Man series, and the CGI was done well. See this movie!"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed watching this movie in the theater! It was a fun ride and I can't wait to see it again!
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was unbelievably atrocious. This 'film' is offensive towards Marvel fans. Disney is really showing their true colors because they know their loyal fans will watch no matter what. The cinematography, visuals, writing, and humor are shockingly poor. Phase 5 is a major step back from recent misses from Marvel. Hopefully, this doesn't signal what's in the future for this franchise. P.S. Cassie Lang's character is one of the worst recasts of all time. She goes from a caring, intelligent, and confident character to selfish, self contained, illogical, and emotionless."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was far from the best MCU movie, but we must stop comparing phase 4 and 5 movies to Endgame and Infinity war. Does this movie compare to those? Hell no, but it does correspond to the MCU phase 1 and 2 caliber films. This was a great way to start a new phase, and we will look back on this after we see how everything connects and say this movie was unfairly reviewed."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It felt very much by the numbers With how everything went in the film. The new actress to play Scott Langs daughter felt flat through most of her scenes, and while the characters of the quantum realm were cool, felt like throw away characters. The only saving grace of the film was Jonathan Majors, who felt menacing through most of his scenes."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,SO GOOD!!!! COOL BUT THE VILLAIN IS NOOB:)
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"With such an incredible cast (exception being Cassie), my mind is blown by how subpar this is. The writing is absolutely pedestrian, I've seen better CGI in SciFi Original movies, and I've seen better action in a Hallmark Holiday Special. You need to do better, Disney."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Average, enjoyable but forgettable."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really fun and sets up the next phase of the Marvel movies really well.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the hate on this movie! First of all the CGI was absolutely beautiful and I really enjoyed seeing everything. Secondly, the plot isn't bad. It isn't the best plot of all time but you can still follow and understand it whilst watching the movie. Third Jonathan Majors ands Paul Rudd's performance were incredible. Only reason this isn't a five star is because of MODAK, he was definitely a little goofy and not as cool as in the comics. But overall a movie that exceeded my expectations because of the bad reviews, best movie Marvel has put out in a long time."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie the ending is really good they made it look like they won even though Scott started doubting himself because it was to easy.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"KANG is here‚Ä¶. The movie was great, better than I expected.  Sets the stage for the next phase of marvel movies.  Don‚Äôt hesitate to go see it."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad dialogue, meh CGI. Maybe next phase will be good. (probably not)"
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Didn't really like it. Boring, not enough Hank scenes. Modok wasted. Kang wasted. Dumb first post credit scene cuz we could've gotten a serious council scene instead we see kang cheering like crazy."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,I actually like the beginning of phase 5 for Marvel.    I think that Kang will be a great villain possibly better than Thanos. Interested to see where it goes from here.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing film don‚Äôt listen to the hater reviews!
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like the villain, what i dislike the story got a little long in the tooth"
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A very weak start to Phase 5 for the MCU. Jonathan Majors' Kang provided some promising, although brief, glimpses of the more serious tone we felt from solid films like, Captain America Civil War or Endgame; however, in true MCU fashion, it was all undermined by untimely dead pan humor and one huge head‚Ä¶scratching character choice. Combine that with a handful full of plot ""holes"" and it seems like Marvel brass didn't learn from the mistakes of Phase 4."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This was fun and entertaining
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Just another setup for the next phase
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Movie, everything a marvel fan expects."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"The pin to the future of Marvel Phase 5. Despite of all the bad reviews, I still see this movie for several times, because I love Marvel, thats all."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted this movie to be good, it had a lot going for it. Majors was great, Michelle Pheiffer was great, but Cassie killed it for me, as well as plenty of other things. The writing failed, and the saddest part of introducing Kang in this movie is he gets killed off by Antman. Doesn't really do a great job of setting him up as an Avengers level threat."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was a mess. My least favorite Marvel movie.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm completely unaware of what so many were dissapointed by. The movie is very visually appealing, humorous frequently, and the story itself is worthwhile. Maybe everyone was hoping for another endgame type film *shrug*."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was fun to watch but I felt the story was lacking soul and individuality. It largely depends on greater MCU connections to other movies and shows so if you are not well versed in the MCU storyline it will seem rather aimless.  I still gave it a 4 star because I really enjoyed it anyways. The easter egg references were good.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Great humor and exciting action. Quite a visual spectacle. Scott Lang is just such a wholesome character who you can‚Äôt help but love once again on his ant-citing adventure vs Kang in the Quantum Realm.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie gave the fun fans expected and the story was joyful as people were excited to see Janet and kang backstory. Vfx was good in my opinion there were no errors. Jonathon majors majors was so excellent and Paul Rudd was also excellent both were Amazing. The other cast members were also fantastic at their role in the movie.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Visual effects fall a little flat sometimes like MODOK face (most of the time) or kangs blue face occasionally but overall for the environment and most of the scenes look vary good. Story was fun and had a serious vibes to it that would be occasionally broken by heartfelt moments or moments with MODOK which kinda fell flat in a few scenes. But overall fun movie
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a good movie for plot not too much action but very good story overall
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"i just liked hope and her few scenes. the movie itself was.. okay. this is the first mcu movie to not make anyone gasp or scream in the theatre. honestly, none of the ant-man movies were that good to me. i also like jonathan majors. couldn‚Äôt have casted anyone better. paul rudd‚Äôs talent is better than this movie."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't know what all the fuss is about, peoples expectations are too high.
Yeah sure its a step down from endgame or infinity war but its an Antman movie I mean come on guys."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is the continues story for the loki and dr. strange movie. the actor of kang did a great job being a villan. the movie tell me more of the quantum and how did the avenger endgame use the quantum to go thru different timeline. this tell me a little background story of kang the conqueror and how he use the quantum to travel in different multiverse. I need more of kang story and how kang the conqueror destroyed different timeline/.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang was a cool villain. I thought some of the stuff were a little weird but all around I liked it
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una pel√≠cula maravillosamente fresca, que nos muestra personajes memorables con arcos de redenci√≥n maravillosos, una historia solida y estupenda, que por momentos une perfectamente puntos olvidados del UCM.
Simplemente estupenda."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,um why is everything that shrinks not given the same properties.  subatomic vs microscopic?  Janet wasn't afraid to go to the realm before. Modok...? not enough kang...
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked the movie, it was different than the other Ant-Man movies but I thought it was done very well. Don't understand what all the negative hype is."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not bad as some reviews, (reviewers)said it to be."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have never written a movie review before but felt compelled to in this instance because of all of the hate I have seen directed at this movie from news articles about how it is a flop. There's nothing wrong with this movie aside from maybe a few failed attempts at humor, as if a movie now has to be perfect to be considered ""good."" The only reason people didn't go see this movie (aside from Marvel fatigue and Thor 4 being bad) is because of the idiot critics out there saying it sucked. It didn't at all. It was a bit more serious than the other Antman movies, but that's to be expected as the series moves on. The only thing it was missing was the signature Michael Pena scene, which is truly a disappointment. Kang is going to  make for an awesome new big baddie, I find him much more compelling than Thanos. It should be illegal for critics to see movies early and give them a bad name, costing the studios millions of dollars. Studios should stop letting them see it early, they are under no obligation to do so."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie lacked a fresh story. It was the same tired story of a disobedient child that gets everyone into trouble and is still made to look like the hero. They made Kang look feckless. Modok was made into a joke. Seems like they spent more time creating the world of the quantum realm than creating an actual story.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst marvel movies to date. VERY cgi heavy. Kang is crazy underpowered (like all other villains in Marvel, smh). Darren, the big head man could not look worse. Terrible humor in this one. Would not recommend."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"The reason is bad, it's just too Cheesy with lame jokes..... but loved the rest. I could have written a better scene where it closes arcs from the 1st installment to add more depth to Scott's and cassie's complex situation --- and add Michael Pena for at least a sweet 30-second spot line. It is not that hard for someone like me to write a better movie that does not look like Love and Thunder... on the positive side, you are in it for a good villain --- Kang's rocky/ CREED III action is sweet in every way and that is the only reason it made it amazing."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of action very typical of marvel! Worth the see !
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Marvel movie, and there was lots of great action with a very colorful background."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is my short review (contains Spoilers!!!) of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023). It was different in a good way--very different, and that made it refreshing. 

A whole new world, a dimension of sorts, but one accesses this dimension through shrinking beyond the matter of the universe itself and entering this Quantum Realm. But the Quantum Realm is  a cross between the comic book Microverse and the Negative Zone, 

Kang as played by Jonathan Majors is larger than life. In fact, perhaps the movie would have been better named: Ant-Man and the Wasp Meet Kang the Conqueror. Major's steals the movie--he is phenomenal.

No, one need not know anything about this comic villain to enjoy the film, though I perhaps enjoyed it more knowing the comic book Kang and seeing how well Majors and Director Peyton Reed captured his essence.

Reed also ably kept the movie forward pacing. He succeeded in utilizing each of the main and supporting actors throughout quite ably: Paul Rudd, Kathryn Newton, Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeifer, and Michael Douglas gave stellar performances. Even Bill Murray and Cory Stoll in ancillary roles added value to the story. 

This was a much better than average MCU movie and one which was consequential for the MCU as a whole."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of year thus far
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"ant-man and the wasp : quANTuMANia,is ant man's movie , but it just like the main character is cassie."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really can't understand the so-called critics who bashed this movie. They write about it as if they were expecting to see a remake of Casablanca or The Godfather. Folks, THIS IS AN MCU MOVIE. It's about a guy who can shrink or blow up his body at will and enters the quantum realm. The movie had great action sequences and Jonathan Majors is awesome at playing Kang, whether it's the Conqueror or the insane He Who Remains in Loki. What exactly were the critics expecting? 

That said, I thought this was a really fun movie with great action sequences like we've seen in almost all of these MCU superhero films. It had its humor (but wasn't cheesy humor like Love and Thunder), and the acting was as good as one can expect in these types of movies.

I love Jonathan Majors as Kang. He was awesome in this movie, just like he was at the end of Loki when he played the bonkers He Who Remains. The setup for the Kang Dynasty was great.

Don't listen to the critics."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm honestly concerned about Marvel at this point.  After Doctor Strange completely ignoring WandaVision, Thor Love & Thunder being a confused mess, I assumed Ant Man 3, in its official introduction of the next big bad, would be a road map for a strong phase....no.

This movie was a mess.  The pacing was weird, certain scenes dragged on, and for the life of me I couldn't figure out what it was trying to be.  One of the rare times during a marvel movie where I'm checking my watch because I'm ready to leave.  Most didn't even stay for the post-credit scenes.

I questioned if Ant Man even deserved a 2nd movie, let alone a 3rd.  This should be the last one.  Hopefully Guardians picks up the torch and carries it properly."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring , a lot of computer animated , i didnt like it at all"
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lots of action but same old tiresome story line
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was funny and a pretty good movie. Honestly, my biggest problem with it is that they didn't have Michael Pe√±a give a recap at the beginning."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The comedy was great..
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was tough to watch. May be the worst Marvel movie made.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you've been waiting for a movie to make you truly feel like you're inside a comic book.  This movie is it.  I don't understand the negative reviews.  To me, it was silly, intriguing, amazing visuals, good jokes, good story.  My only complaint was how they portrayed MODOK (silly, goofy), and then killed him off.  He's a villain that should span several films."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action with twists and turns. It was a little too long.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie, Paul Rudd is and always will be Ant-Man!"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It‚Äôs Ant-Man, what did you expect. Honestly, I expected a lot less. I‚Äôm excited to see Ant-Man in this new Giant role (pun intended). Awesome action, characters,and comedy. I honestly want to watch it again. My family loved it."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Average acting, thin support on new characters.   Best part is the end of movie Easter eggs."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It was well written and performed! Can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next!
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fun, great graphics. All star cast."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story and opened up the multivariate even more.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!! Loved Jonathan majors acting!
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a lot of fun, with a more serious tone than past movie's in this franchise. You still get the laughs, the visuals and the and the excitement. A great set up film for the remainder of phase 5."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"filme mediano, prometeu demais e entregou um 6/10"
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was average.  The plot was weak.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"CGI was state of the art. Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd were excellent, easily pulled off a lot of abstract stuff. It never felt like the action ever stopped. I would have liked to have seen Kang earlier in the picture. "
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really great ! There is something always going on and is consistent with keeping you at the edge of your seat.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,A little disjointed at times.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film, very fun.  I do not like the bad guy being black, vs. a white team, but aside from that it was fun. My 11 yr old loved it. I thought the cgi was surprisingly non-distracting unlike some films. The jokes were all good and Cassie was amazing as a character. I would have liked to see Hope featured more. But wasn't her mother the Wasp too? So it was really both of them?  Not too subtle but still it all worked. The suit Kang was using and his powers seemed to get nerfed near the end but it was seemingly damaged by the ants or whatever. I'm not looking for total believability."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like the characters and the action, has a good storyline."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,There were definitely glimpses of a great movie but it ultimately made it more disappointing when you look at the actual end result.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining movie and really explains the quantum realm and Kangs storyline.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie.  Haters going to hate.  Stop taking superhero movies too seriously. Great setup for Kang, and a lot of fun."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,GO ANTS!! WOO!  youll see what Im talking about
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,YES!!!! KANG!! KANG!! KANG!! KANG!!! AMAZING!!!
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was silly, but very entertaining!"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It was soooo fun to see! The action was just crazy! You should watch it now!!!!!
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,The only thing that stops this from being the worst Marvel ever is every other Marvel movie since End Game.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,O filme √© muito abaixo do esperado.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great continuation of the Ant-man story, delving into a new world made for lots of fun suprises!"
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Valid but a little confusing. Kang is awesome. Villains are stupid.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Great balance of comedy and action. Amazing movie for everyone to enjoy!
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible movie...was actually looking forward to it being over.  Cheesy characters, horrible B movie dialogue and several odd scenes reminiscent of the old Star Wars movies but somehow way less cool.  Wasn't funny like the first 2 movies in the series....and it should have been. Not sure who this new group of writers are for the last few Marvel movies but feels like Marvel is on the way down fast.  Another disappointing over CGI'ed movie that is barely worth the time it takes to sit through it and is definitely not worth the cost of a movie ticket."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie!!! Love it üëçüëå
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,My son and I loved it.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and nice storyline.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"We don't see a lot of Marvel movies, so had little to base comparisons on, but liked the trailer. And despite being confused by several plot details, we enjoyed the acting, story and special effects. Not a great movie, but entertaining."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Some bad language!  Good movie - but disappointed with the language.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow, just wow.  I feel bad."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie has a lot of action in it I thought it was pretty good.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie loved Kang loved the movie overall but definitely not the best MCU movie but really worth the see!!!!!!!
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"No exactly what we all wanted, but a great movie overall."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Pretty cut and paste. The villain was nothing special. Effects were meh.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Sequel for the sake of a sequel. Just another forgettable marvel stand-alone in the pile.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Made up for Thor love and thunder
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! The critics don't know what their talking about as usual.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Thought it was overall good. Certain characters felt out of place or served no purpose
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,We liked the whole story and can‚Äôt wait for the upcoming adventure.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is a great installment to the MCU. Kang will be a great Villian whichever one that may be. Way better than Love & Thunder ‚Ä¶. WAY BETTER.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic moral messages along with an all around fun movie, I want more like this please. Keep up the good work Marvel"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Melhor filme da Marvel, desde Homem Aranha; Sem volta pra Casa
n√£o tem woke culture, isso j√° diz tudo"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the beginning of something great
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,You'll just have to go see it. It was REALLY Goodüëç
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Had no real plot and was honestly dull
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie. It was funny and action packed and moved the MCU story forward. Critics must have been watching something else.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. Wish it was longer. And few less jokes would have been appreciated.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it more than the last few Phase 4 movies. Decent start to Phase 5 in my opinion.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Like all actors picked for Marvel roles. Paul Rudd is a phenomenal Ant Man. Keep it up. It was really cool to see Bill Murray. And the end with the ants and Michael Douglas. Really cool. Brought up memories of watching Romancing The Stone. When I was 15. Spending time down the shore.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie definitely does not deserve the low critics reviews and Rotton Tomatoes score. This was a good, not great, but good start to phase 4 and the Kang Dynasty. I don't think the plot over reached and missed like many critics said."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Meeh. Paul Rudd was good. The story not so much.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not great, not memorable."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,All around fun ride that opens the doors to a great 5th wave!!
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Forget the 'official critics' rating! Quantumania is a fantastic, epic, high action super-hero thrill ride in the MCU and, at least in my opinion, one of their best movies to date. Appreciate this movie for what it, and most Marvel movies are: a solid 90 minutes or so of cinematic Fun! 

Paul Rudd turns in another great comedic performance and Jonathan Majors is suburb as the Big Bad, Kang. Majors' performance alone is enough to make this a worthwhile viewing and promises an exciting Phase Six of the MCU to look forward to. So if you haven't seen this movie yet, what are you waiting for? Get yerself a ticket and enjoy! If you've already seen it, see it again. I certainly plan to. üòé"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It was better then people say
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is honestly one of my new favorite movies, the concept is so trippy and the film serves up proper plates throughout the digestion of the film. The open ended theories of what could occur now are insane to think about. For fans of movies, and not marvel, this one is not for you, for fans of marvel and not movies, I get you may be upset at a character design but when have comic to movie adaptations ever gotten it ""right""? I saw bravo for letting another artist or team of artist's create something new, regardless of the opinion of it, art is subjective and this film should be seen as such. For hardcore Marvel Comics fans, the creative nerds, artists and such, this movie will blow your mind. This AND Eternals are some of the BEST concepts and films in my opinion, which may be unpopular, but so was Dali and Van Gough at one point. Keep on keepin on."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors does not miss! He is truly one of the most amazing actors, on the come up, we've seen in a long time. Long live The Conqueror!!"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is really good. Like it's an ant man movie not an avengers movie.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoy it very much!!!....sometimes a little bit over the top and the art-design is sometimes between of very good and very confusing  ;-/.....
But this is absolutely a very good Popcorn-Movie!!! Bomb-End-Credit-Scene ;-) !!!"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent film. Loved Kang. Happy that Scott got a story where he truly is the savior with The Wasp.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie. I'm glad Marvel has a good cinematic direction.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,An absolutely pointless movie. Boring and contrived.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you're into the whole MCU, you might dig it. Kang was good. M.O.D.O.K. was way too hokey & pretty much turned the entire movie into a punchline."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was better than I thought!
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" brings the recent Marvel fatigue to an all-time high. This movie has some things I enjoyed like the characters, the humor, and some of the action was fun to watch. I just thought the story was not really engaging at all. The final act was a lot of fun but everything until there had me pretty bored. I think it does a lot of setting up for the next Marvel phase but forgets to be an engaging movie. I still think it isn't necessarily bad but it is definitely pretty weak for Marvel standards. Overall, this movie is decent popcorn fun but it feels like an underwhelming introduction to a new villain and a somewhat incohesive and tonally confused product."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,very entertaining. dbox was great.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Quantumania felt completely soulless to me which is ironic because it felt like the entire movie was driving home how important family is. It felt so flat and unimportant which was so disappointing because it seemed like it SHOULD feel like one of the most important events in the MCU to date. Jonathan Majors was this movie's saving grace in my opinion. It wasn't the worst MCU film (looking at you, eternals), but it was most definitely a flop in terms of Marvel movies."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun story, gorgeous visuals, just the right injection of humor.  Loved it!!!"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,La pelicula es buena no es lo peor ni lo mejor pero es buen inicio de fase
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,5 year old granddaughter loved it. Good movie!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"La mejor pel√≠cula de la vida todo lo hace perfecto, conectas muy bien con los personajes, efectos especiales de la m√°s alta calidad, adoro a MODOK su arco de redenci√≥n supera por mucho a el de Loki o el de bucky, y Kang, o Kang, la mejor parte de toda la pel√≠cula, su actitud, su manera de actuar, como se ve, todo es perfecto es la mejor pel√≠cula de todo el ucm, y una de las mejores pel√≠culas en general"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,For a senior citizen watching the movie it reminded me of other Star Wars type movies. Good against evil. Sorry Bill Murray didnt have a bigger part. Michael Douglas. And Michelle Pfeiffer.was an interesting pair for this movie. Standard star war  fighting scenes. Never count anyone out they will show up in the next sequel.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent film, builds the basis for Kang and goes back into some Loki episodes at the very end. I think it's a must see"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I mostly went to see this to watch the Jonathen Majors/Kang evolution, after being blown away by He Who Remains in Loki.  He's a phenomenal actor, but after seeing Quantumania, I worry he's going to end up hamstrung by really stupid scripts, like this one."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! I don't know why people are bashing it.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the action and Kang! Love the MCU!
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst Marvel offerings yet. Entirely forgettable, too foreign, and without charm. The CGI was awful in places, inconsistent. Worst of all. Boring."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania was a fun movie. I was entertained throughout. Introduction of the new realm was beautiful. Marvel is good at introducing new characters and getting you to love them. They do the same here. The ensemble cast, villain and heroes, are great together.  Enjoyed the ending."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang/Majors and Paul Rudd made this tolerable.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kang(Jonothan Majors) pulls an ‚Äò07 Lebron w/ this movie making it watchable. 

*Spoilers*
Modok sucks ass in this movie when he first appears they make him out to be a menacing threat then they immediately turn him into terribly CGIed joke and try to make him threatening when chasing Cassie at the end but we know he's just a joke. And don't get me started The I'm not a dick line and how they make a comedic scene out him spitting up blood dying."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"it could be waaaaaaaay better
try again,Marvel
you can do it"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally a phase 5 movie which moves things forward. A great introduction to Kang.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,bold action sound graphics interesting character developmt
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Go see it. It‚Äôs fun and Kang makes it! 
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked it, especially Jentorra!! She's so cool and tough!! And Cassie is awesome too!!"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie felt too long and didn‚Äôt really track thru or connect the dots ‚Ä¶
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,great first movie for Kang the new super villain!!!!!!!!!!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Villian, Action & Funny"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lackluster plot with beloved characters like M.O.D.O.K being very comic accurate with the armour and said to hell with it for a face that isn't even remotely like the comics. Honestly, just wait until it comes out on disney plus."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it was funny and light hearted.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great marvel film my children and I enjoyed it.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Wasn‚Äôt a bad movie. Had good parts and funny parts, but MID overall."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Still enjoyed the movie on the second watch.  A good watch.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was bad. So bad that it was funny
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It entertained me, and I had a good time. However, I felt at some points during the movie you were taken out of it to an extent. Mainly, through patchy CGI and humour. I felt the third act faltered, mainly because it failed to wrap up the themes, stakes, and plot of the movie in a satisfying way to the audience."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Its an unfunny, two hour episode if Rick and Morty. A total snoozefest. Wait until it's on Disney plus and watch it stoned."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great laughs and great fight scenes
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie so much
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining, and feels a bit more like a Star Wars film in the first half but a very solid return to marvel films despite critics reviews who often don't know what makes for a good and entertaining film."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was great fun and had a lot of heart with the center of the story being a dad's love for his daughter. Villain was fantastic and Paul Rudd blew it out of the park like always. Everyone was fantastic and the story was engaging. Critics are no fun.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It's was good overall
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I really enjoyed the ride the ride the movie took us on, it was a beautiful spectacle of visuals. My only critic, I believed the daughters arc took away from the story a little but it was a great ride. Everything else was perfect. It was a fun ride"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a decent movie.  Don't listen to the critics!  They prefer Cocaine Bear anyways.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,As an Ant-Man fan this one was the worst. Skip it. It‚Äôs terrible.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked characters, plot."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought the movie was great. I was expecting it to be terrible based on the reviews it‚Äôs getting, so went in wit low expectations, but I liked it better than the 2nd movie and it‚Äôs better than Wakanda Forever by far. It‚Äôs funny and the new characters added some more charm do it. I wouldn‚Äôt listen to the critics on this one - if you like the other Antman movies and Paul Rudd in general you will enjoy this."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a prime example of why fans should ignore critics and see a movie for themselves. The movie was great. Kang is a stellar villain, Scott and Hope we're able to show how their love makes them an unbreakable team. Janet was excellent and her dramatic acting in scenes with Kang was gripping. Hank Pym is charismatic and funny as usual and Cassie Lang is likely a natural leader in the future Young Avengers initiative. Only slight was the Disney-fied characters in parts of the Quantum Realm, but they are very funny and aren't all that distracting. The CGI in the end credits was unfinished, but my family and I enjoyed this movie and will see it again."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Best Antman yet!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid film. Funny, little cheezy, good graphics. Classic Marvel movie."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,For MCU fans mostly but I enjoyed it. Couldn't say the same for Wakanda Forever.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the movie - great graphics.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,The plot Is just pathetic. Great actors were hired for nothing.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Gorgeous looking movie but just not very good. Maybe its having to rework the plot, maybe its the over reliance on references to comics, maybe its the not taking itself seriously without actually being funny (or all that much fun). It doesn't help that Ant-Man has the least interesting action scenes since he essentially only has two moves."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This latest Ant-Man and the Wasp adventure was amazing, a true epic film. It has a darker tone (at times) that the previous two outings didn't have, and I enjoyed it. This movie also sets the stage for Marvel's next phase of films, and I think the whole cast and story of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania started this out on a powerful first step."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the storyline of the movie and the ongoing comedy. I was a bit disappointed that we didn't get to see more of the quantum world/realm, I feel like this movie could have been longer and more sentimental."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very boring movie. Bad start to the phase and totally inconsequential. The antman trilogy has fallen since the first. The cgi is poor for Marvel content.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was a movie. I can say that about it.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is horrible.  wayyy too long and confusing plot.  I would have rather saw Star Wars for the 100th time which , in my opinion Ant Man was trying to copy 

Stay away , stay far far away"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not bad a little corny and slightly predictable
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good movie but a little slow in the middle and some parts they could have done better but overall a great movie
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Really Good movie haven‚Äôt seen a marvel movie in a while the actors were great the animation were really good definitely would see it again
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Literally want to watch it in 3D right now. Haven't even seen the 2nd speak peak after the credits yet and have asked 2 people if we can go this week  EVERYTHING is perfect!! Entire story, the buildup, the animation and the MESSAGE!! More like the hundreds of wonderful messages"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It wasn‚Äôt the best film in the MCU, but I thought it was a solid entry. Paul Rudd is always likable, Michelle Pfeiffer gets a nice expanded roll, and Jonathan Majors various Kangs should be an interesting big baddie to look forward to. If you generally enjoy MCU movies, you should enjoy this one too."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The cinematography was fantastic. A new universe exists and many stories can be told about the Quantum Universe going forward. Some of the new characters reminded me of Star Wars, which was fun. The story line was complex but enjoyable. The scene changes to follow the story keep me locked in. I just hope Bill Murray's character didn't die. It's a love story that keeps you interested right until the end."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The new Ant Man and the Wasp movie was an enjoyable ride that though predictable, delivered an exciting new direction for the MCU.

*SPOILER FREE*
Since Endgame, Marvel has been experimenting with their formula in different ways. Like it or not, it has definitely led to a much more varied Phase V. They are trying to find a way to explore things in less predictable ways, and sometimes they miss the mark, other times they don't, but Phase V holds a substantial evolution of the MCU if you look a bit underneath the surface, even though this transition phase may be a bit awkward. 

Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is one of the better experiments in Phase V, and though it definitely isn't the best of Marvel, it is FAR from the worst and gives me a lot of hope for the franchise. Quantumania uses a deliberately very predictable plot in order to explore worldbuilding more. After seeing it my father remarked it was ""The best Star Wars movie"" he'd seen in a long time. It's an apt comparison with Quantumania exploring themes of ideology and power disputes in an alien universe. In introducing a larger element of Science Fantasy to the story they are able to dig deep into this universe using a wide variety of interesting side characters, side plots, and constantly shifting settings. The world built here IS quite unique despite its obviously heavy Star Wars influences.

But given the universe is so unique and interesting, it becomes quite graphically intensive. And here we come to the CGI; it's unfinished. Quite a few shots have compositing errors, rough greenscreen lighting, rotoscoping errors, etc. No shot is horrible, and the majority of the film looks quite nice, but every 20 seconds there would be a shot that looked almost, dare I say, amateur? Obviously the CG artists working on this film were top tier, and most of these mistakes could have easily been fixed just by editing a few values, reordering a few layers, etc., and I suspect that fixing them all would have taken a maximum of another 3 months, but ultimately I just don't think Marvel or Disney care enough. Sure they COULD delay the release to September, but they'd make more money NOW. It's really unfortunate that these companies having such large monopolies can compromise on the quality of movies we see, and I'm upset with Disney for rushing the movie out.

Now this isn't to say that the movie doesn't look good, in fact, it looks (pardon my French) fucking amazing. It's some of the best CGI that Marvel has ever had, and the practical effects are also some of the best they've ever had. The set dressing in particular really shines in this film. I do wish they had mixed up the color fixing a bit more to differentiate the different settings. They did a little bit, but overall the movie does have quite a bit of sepia tones, but this is mostly a nitpick due to me personally caring so much about that kind of stuff.

*SPOILER TERRITORY*
Ok, so as stated previously, the movie is quite predictable. It is so intentionally to be able to introduce people to the world, but a more emotionally charged plot definitely would have elevated the film. I especially feel the ending could have been changed to leave Scott and Hope in the Quantum Realm, or potentially even (and this would have been quite dark mind you) killing off Cassie. As it stands we really don't have any character deaths, even side character deaths (like, I mean, there's Daryl, but given that MODOK is well MODOK and Daryl has been presumed dead since the first movie in which he was an annoying asshole villain, it's kinda hard to care). I get why they did this. This is a really ambitious movie in terms of worldbuilding, and a lot of energy was spent in that area, but the lack of consequences in the plot does undermine Kang's power in certain respects. 

The first few scenes of the movie were also WAY too rushed. Spending more time there and maybe less on the climax would have definitely helped pacing issues. That being said, Scott's arc is quite well done, even if it is predictable. He is one of the more interesting MCU characters, so I am really glad how they continued focusing on how he tries to become a better person. I am also glad however, how much more the movie focuses on other characters. Not a huge amount is done to flesh out characters other than Cassie, again because of how much worldbuilding they wanted to do, but I am glad that the movie really has an ensemble cast, especially in relation to how much it's about Scott becoming less selfish. Embodying the themes of a film in its plot is not a new concept, but this film does it remarkably well throughout all of its major themes: selfishness, socialism, and how both relate to people changing. 

*CONCLUSION*
I think the movie was good, but I also feel that with a more ambitious plot that tackled these themes in less predictable ways that had actual consequences it really could have been one of Marvel's best. The thing that gives me hope here is that it feels like Marvel is beginning to realize how to do that. I think that once we come out of this awkward teenage phase for the MCU we're going to get some incredible films out of it. Overall the worldbuilding really was enjoyable and highly reminiscent of Star Wars. As someone who is a huge fan of worldbuilding, this movie was a lot of fun, but if you're someone who doesn't really care about that, this movie might not be quite as interesting for you. I'm just excited that Marvel seems to be moving in a direction where they will soon be able to do both in unique ways that they couldn't before."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,had its cheesy moments of course its Marvel... but much better than people are saying

"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,A great movie. A great way to start our Phase 5 and tee up the next major villian (after the with Loki did if course!)!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Visually stunning with a great storyline! Some unexpected stuff too
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The visuals are great on the big screen, but the plot plays out like a really long episode of a TV series.

Imagine watching the newest episode of The Last of Us this Sunday while knowing the next episode won't come out for 6 months. This is the new strategy of Disney, and, for this reason, Quatumania is the last Marvel movie I will ever pay to see."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun, funny action packed movie."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was all over the place.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it.  There are a few things that could have been better but overall this is a prelude into several other movies and shows.  Not everything is going to make sense.  I am worried that MCU will start to oise the causal fan.  My 11 year old son doesn't have any interest in seeing the movie.  Broke my heart.  But that's ok.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the latest Marvel movie to lose my interest. The premise is fine I suppose, but the execution is filled with fluff. This movie suffers heavily from it's unenthusiastic acting and direction. The actors seem almost as uninterested as I was. Marvel movies are feeling like a chore to watch just so we can understand what happens in the next film."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!! Cant wait for whats to come in the MCU!!
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The worst Marvel movie ever! The meaning of the film is predictable. The very idea of the plot is stupid. Getting to know Kang could have been much better. And Kathryn Newton is a very bad actress for the Cassie role. Why the hell was she also given a costume and made a hero ?! Ant man and Wasp were already more than enough. 
In short, the film disappointment!"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie was over all amazing the actors did a great job and the plot was amazing I recommend to see it it's pretty goodü§ç
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,A good way to spend some time if you want to keep up on the Marvel Universe. Hardly the same as it seems they find it more important to stick to the script of moving onto the Marvel phases than they do on making a great movie. Too many things slapped together that if you are a real Marvel fan you can tear apart. Th eMarvel Universe is slowly falling into an unacceptable multi-verse.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked the characters, but the story wasn't clear.  I wanted to love it, but I couldn't."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,After seeing the Reviews and the Trailer I thought the Movie is going to be really bad. I never thought they are able to fit all those fancy scenes from the trailer in to that movie but they actually managed to do it. Although the plot felt a little bit forced it fitted into the whole storyline of the MCU. The story of the movie developed pretty fast and led to a kitschy finale but it was actually kinda nice to watch. The End was finally a smart ending where the main character takes the obvious option that leads to a happy end. Not that kind of ending where the protagonist took the worst possible option in favor of the studio so they can produce a worse sequel. All in all I loved that movie and would definitely recommend watching it.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was actually my first time seeing this series of movies but, I enjoyed it action and about family"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a comic book come to life. A super weird sci-fi entry to the MCU rooted in family & setting up the next big bad, Kang The Conqueror. There's solid performances across the board, but the stand out is Jonathan Majors."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,The Movie is great it has a good plot and great villain
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's whatever. Average CGI, decent workbuilding and character design, Best at hitting all the  clich√©s(very predictable), many potholes and continuityerrors with MCU, moronic Villians, annoying characters(mainly cassie), okaish storyline,unfunny one liner humour, watch this if you got nothing better to do ig."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie could have been just a mini TV series. The movie was good as per se. But the reality is that the only important thing of this entire movie were just the first post credit scene. 

Ok I get it was important to introduce Loky Season 2 but that is not enough for a Marvel Movie."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,My whole family Loved it!
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,The story  had lots of twists and turns.  I will  have to watch  again  to understand  them all
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was terrible. I almost fell asleep halfway through. I didnt really like the characters and some things like the barrier towards the end didnt make sense. Why would the barrier suddenly break when he just jumped at it again. 

This movie also didnt do much. Everyone was still alive and well. The only thing it did, was to intodruce a major thread to the MCU. But they could have did that with a single post-credit scene. 

Also: Did anyone else think, that the last hour or so looked a lot like star wars, with the clones, the city with the big tower, the spaceships and blasters and the way the fight was structured. 

Overall this movie was terrible."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was very good!  Higher stakes and the people complaining about it being CGI, what else could it have been???  They were in the Quantum Realm.  why give this a hard time but not Avatar?"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome
10/10 experience especially when modok said its modoking time and modoked all over the place"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good characters, if a bit flat with little to no character development. Humorous. Good visual effects."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,marvel ended up in end game
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,I fell asleep from CGI overload. And I just gave up on trying to follow the plot. It just wasn't worth trying to follow after awhile.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Predictable but entertaining
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,The picture quality wasn't as good for it be considered 3D. I'd prefer watching just regular or IMAX
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Xanax Bear.  Nap time.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Insufferably derivative.  I knew the second the same old, tired Canteen scene derived from Star Wars started that this movie was going to be almost entirely unoriginal."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love the cast but I felt overstimulated by the visuals and underwhelmed by the script and plot lines. Less would have been more in this case. 
Sorry to say my least favourite MCU film."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film had a lot of strange elements, some of which worked and others which really, truly didn't. But, the cgi and art direction were inspired, making it at least entertaining to see. The humorous timing and tone swings were more misses than hits, and the stakes never felt truly real. Really, it feels almost entirely pointless and is incredibly predictable the entire time."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The pacing was off, the acting was off, the visual effects didnt look finished for one character (youll know when you see him), and there were character decisions made that didnt align with previously established character traits. Visually, it looks great, Paul Rudd was as lovable as ever, Jonathan Majors was so menacing yet charismatic, and Michael Douglas played his best Hank Pym yet. Id say its better than average, but not a great kickoff to Phase 5."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,movie is exceptionally entertaining
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"At it's core, ""Quantumania"" has a solid story. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang brings an everyman quality to his hero that is easy to root for. There is humor without being over the top (""Love and Thunder""). You never feel as if any of the main characters are simply window dressing. I'd definitely watch it again."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great CGI, story sets up the future of the MCU and Jonathan Majors is a joy to watch in this film. Worth the watch!"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang is a great bad guy. I loved how the now five main characters from all the Ant Man movies work together. The CG multiverse did not disappoint.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie. No consistent plot. Miss old Marvel.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Overall good movie.  Not the best marvel installment and not the worst.  Keeps the plot lines going.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love it.
Can't understand again the critics....go see the movie to have your own appreciation ."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Do not know what the critics are talking about ! Went and really enjoyed it , a fun film, and probably the best one so far , post endgame. Ant man is the absolute hero of his story ,and looking forward to more Kang!"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn't like the coarse language. Everything else was awesome!
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A living proof that no matter how great IP and cast you have, without scenario it's nothing. The last time I've been so bored ehiel watching Marvel films has been the newest Doctor Strange, so I wonder if the company will be able to find a good solution to how to develop the brand next. Plus, the ehole idea of an evil character sidekick has been so... mediocre."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great. Critics are too critical. This movie was fun. Another great install for ant man and the wasp. The VFX were great. 
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,While I wouldn't claim this is the best movie in the franchise this was a solid and enjoyable entry. A step up from the last Doctor Strange and Thor movies.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Perfect amount action meets storyline!
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not a good movie. Wrong casting choice for Cassie lang. Worst movie ever.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Marvel films are other genre films hiding in super hero films.  This was no exception.  Welcome my friends to Sword and Planet. If you're fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs, this is the Marvel film for you.

This movie was weird until I realized what was happening.  A bunch of humans get transported to a fantastical world where none of the rules as we understand them seem to apply. There they discover one of their own has a long and rich history within this world.  Her fellow travelers function as a stand in for the audience allowing her to explain the history and culture of this world, until the action begins.

Like Avengers: Infinity War, this was a Villain's Story.  This was about Kang more than anyone else.  It was nice to spend some time with him after getting to see He Who Remains. Honestly it was a good turn for the MCU.  For the first time since Endgame it didn't feel like we were in mourning.

Some of the flashback to earlier films didn't quite hit for me.  They were a little forced as a narrative device compared to the story telling of the noticeably absent Michael Pena."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"and a Quarter stars.
The ending may have felt a bit Deus ex Maxhina for the critics but as a fan of the comics and movies I was hoping that Hank would pull this one out of his hat. His ear piece bugged me (pun intended) since the beginning. Good touch tones and call backs. Only missing the hyper info dumps of the first two films."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie seemed like another decent marvel movie that I will probably never want to watch again unless Im watching all the marvel movies in order again, Paul Rudd seemed to carry this movie along with Jonathan Majors who played Kang perfectly and I am very excited for Kang Dynasty. Cassie however was awful and ruined the movie for me as her character was just cringy clearly being pushed by the writers to make her seem like a badass, cool, inspiring hero but just came across as a joke and an idiot with many terrible decisions made throughout the movie that could have easily been avoided. The supporting cast was good all around and if it wasnt for them I wouldnt have enjoyed the movie at all. MODOK wasnt terrible and bringing back Darren Cross to be him was pretty cool especially that he was kinda wasted in antman. However the scene where Cassie told MODOK not to be a dick anymore and that changed his entire life, well it was so extremely bad it made me want to kill myself watching it unprepared for the awfulness of it and honestly all I could think about was how the writers team must have asked a 6th grader to write how that interaction would go because that is dumb makes no sense 6th grade stupidity humor right there. Overall it wasnt terrible but Cassie ruined the entire movie for me, the actor who played Cassie (Kathryn Newton) wasnt bad at all its just that she was clearly given terrible lines and a terrible character to work with which is not her fault in any way."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"MODOK was so weird... and a missed opportunity for some emotional depth instead of a gag. Kang is being set up as an interesting, terrifying villain but even some of the execution/ portrayal was a little cheesy. The father-daughter dynamic was relatable, Janet's behavior was frustrating, and Hope was pretty 2-dimensional. Visuals were great and setting/situations were thought-provoking.

...still can't get MODOK's face out of my mind."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great way to kick start the next phase of the MCU!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me pareci√≥ una pel√≠cula fresca, god y un buen inicio para la fase 5 del ucm, la trama y el guion para mi tiene unos peque√±os agujeros, hay algunos fallos pero hay cosas que se entienden, los personajes estuvieron muy buenos (mas Janett, Scott y kang) y los efectos visuales ufff deslumbrantes y √©picos.
El final estuvo bien y espectacular."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,So good in editing and really good shots
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,CGI was awful and I felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie the whole time
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is very enjoyable.  The creation of this whole new world with the Quantum Realm was very impressive. All the crazy different species is incredible and fun.  The visuals were amazing and entrancing. Kang is a character that had a interesting arc in this film and it is obvious we will see more of him in other MCU films.  I can't wait to see more of him. I did miss Michael Pe√±a, but realize it would not have made a lot of sense to force him in somewhere.  I assume we will see at least one more Ant-Man and the Wasp film and I can not wait."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"To unrealistic, not as much fun"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"We enjoyed it, especially Johnathan Majors as Kang. He is the perfect replacement for Thanos as a villain. Superb actor! We also thought the MODOK storyline was really funny. Did not like the ending at all! It was very unbelievable that Antman and the Wasp would be able to go back home so soon after everything was destroyed. We thought they should have been trapped there and bought back in the next movie or at least after like a year or something. Loved the Loki after after part - so excited for that!"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great flick. Best one in a while for Marvel. Way to kick off a new phase 
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,it was action packed from the start
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Imaginative environment. Entertaining
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,ChatGPTs first screenwriting credit
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is my favorite of the Ant-Man movies released.  I think it does a great job of taking Ant Man into a little more of a serious direction without tainting the Ant Man feel.  At times his daughter throws momentum off, trying hard to get the viewer to see she's the next coming generation of Pym Particle users.  I like the CGI characters that are introduced but they could have used more time on screen.  That does bring me to MODOK.  I don't feel the character should be receiving as much criticism as it is.  He's a floating head so it was already difficult to take him seriously as is.  Making him a threat/comedic relief was the safest direction and had myself and others laughing.  Kang was a fantastic villain that felt like he could kill the avengers.  I appreciate that they should just how overwhelmingly powerful he is in comparison to Ant Man.  They're 1 on 1 showcasing his hand to hand combat skills.  The ending gave a wonderful sense of anxiety and anticipation for the next film.   I'm excited!"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"(TW: a very critical review and I do not mean to offend anybody) I think that this movie was written very sloppy. I think that they had made it very cheesy with all the jokey dialogue that was put into the film. I was also upset that Kang was so easily defeated by a non-powered hero. Kang is supposed to be an Avengers level threat and as we know in the comics worse a threat than thanos. They absolutely just focused on making a comedic film which personally I was not looking for. 
 I was expecting Kang to kill Antman and although Antman is a great character it would been a great introduction to Kang but instead. In the beginning he seemed very f powerful but then all the sudden he became  very weak and lost in hand to hand combat with Antman. Overall I was not a fan of this film I really hope these marvel movies coming up will not share the same sloppy story this movie had done."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun flick. Visually cool.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the move is ü§© funny
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall enjoyable experience, and the cast was great.  I just thought the plot was simple and their wasnt really any character evolution or development."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good and entertaining start to Marvel Phase 5. Jonathan Major is such a great actor. I wished we spent more time diving deeper into his back story, but I know this an Ant-man movie/comedy."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was great the visuals and the story were great I really liked king the conqueror in this movie, he is such a thrill to watch on the big screen and overall this movie was great from start to finish"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid and entertaining movie.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good entry in the MCU, sets up phase five."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun movie, but could have been more. Overall, I still would recommend"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very good story line funny humour quite silly and sentimental. The 2 bad things are how was did a human defeat Kang and how did Casey a girl get out of the quantum realm but a guy who created a chair that can travel the multiverse can't.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I came into this movie with lower expectations, given the latest MCU movies/TV.  Was pleasantly surprised.  It dragged a little at times, but overall enjoyable due to Paul Rudd's performance.  Good end credit scene too, probably to best one from Marvel in a while.  Would recommend."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"the movie ant man and the wasp: quantumania is an average movie, bad script and kang, the conqueror, looks like the gorr of thor love and thunder that doesn't kill anyone in the movie looks like the movie of the adventures of the afternoon session of TV."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie is missing something and that something is Michael Pena. Felt like the movie was incomplete.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,A.really enjoyable movie and the ratings are wrong; since Chang Shi this is the best and worth the big screen.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"With major script and vfx issues, this movie is held up by Majors, Pfeiffer, and Douglas' performances. Oh, and the mid/end credit scenes that let's us see a small beam of light at the end of the tunnel."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a good start the phase 5.  True fans not critics will understand the light humor, interconnected points between the phases and the importance of the development of the kang rise.  The visual were great the cast was funny and tough.  Bring on GOTG"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Missed Scott's three business associates in the movie. Did not like how Kang's character was developed in the movie. Corey Stoll appearing as M.O.D.O.K. was just too weird.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cash grab movie, no depth "
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,An entretaining watch overall. Definitley doesn't deserve some of the hate it's getting. Majors is the stand out as Kang! MODOK was brilliant!
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was overwhelmingly mid. I wish they leaned more into the serious tone like Walanda Forever did. I will have to disagree with the critics, there's no world where this movie is worse than The Eternals, Thor, Thor: The Dark World or Thor: Love and Thunder."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I LOVE ANTMAN 3!! its certainly elevated itself to more than a charming family and neighborhood comedy with superhero powers. i watched this on my local IMAX 3D and its eyecandy from beginning to end. you'll see why the title is QUANTUMANIA when you watch the movie. also choosing QUANTUMANIA as a title is a very clever use of our hero quANTuMANia
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie made me lose open Marvel.
How did you mess up antman?"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,A bad movie buried under the weight of ensemble and franchise madness. The only redeeming factor is that the cast is outstanding. The plot is absolute drivel. There were a handful of pointless and half-baked characters that took away from the movie. I think this could have been a good movie if it was just a bit tighter in the editing room.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was fine, I think most critics are just tired of Superhero movies at this point.  My niece, brother, and I all had a fun time watching it.  Kang was a bada$$ (a Kang that was without most of his tech).  It was better than the other stuff critics called ""great"" as of late.  She-Hulk was not good guys give me a break."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a fun time. Definitely not Marvel's best. But then again, it didn't have to be. It's a movie setting up a saga. The corny bits felt like they were meant to be corny. After all, this is the Dad Avenger, we're talking about. For a film that is part of Act One of the Multiverse Saga, it was good."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"For an Antman film, it's about as good as it can be! However for the initiation of phase 5, it was underwhelming. The film lacked in a lot of areas, including a lot of CGI! It introduced Kang and the end credit scenes were interesting, but it is a mediocre start to the new phase!"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a fun ride!  Very different from the first 2 Ant-Man installments, being almost entirely in the quantum realm.  The action was enjoyable and Kang as a Villain worked VERY well.

That said, one of the challenges Marvel Movies have had since the very beginning of Phase 1 have been believable, relatable stakes.  This movie has challenges here. (slight spoilers ahead)

The stakes of Kang getting out the Quantum Realm worked.  Felt very ""real"" and palpable.  The final Ant-Man v. Kang fight felt weighty, in a good way.

But the stakes of Kang's reign in the Quantum Realm over the Quantum beings/people feel too detached / fanciful.  It didn't feel grounded in reality, and I didn't feel much for those characters' fates.  

Its a beautiful movie, but a LOT of CGI to watch (maybe it was more intense as the Mrs. and I watched in 3D for the first time in years).  It was a big swing, and while I think it ""worked"" it was also a bit exhausting, visually, to watch?

Overall I would say 4 stars, or something ranging between a B- and a B+ depending on perspective.  Definitely not the top tier of Marvel Movies, and I think the big swing of the quantum realm prevented some of the trademark Ant-Man humor from really hitting.  But the visual were pretty, the action was fantastic, and story well done despite my lack of interest in the Quantum-People.

Majors as Kang was fantastic!  LONG LIVE KANG!"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Don't understand the reviews. There's really nothing wrong with it. Particularly can't comprehend the criticism of the CGI. They have to depict a story that includes a fictional universe, giant ants, and outrageous otherworldly creatures. What else are they supposed to do? It certainly doesn't look bad."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertained throughout the movie
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, another disappointment from Marvel. Sorry but visually, the film is already ugly. Apart from a few scenes at the beginning, everything else is very dark, no color work. The scenario is more than laughable, and no new stakes are in order since the threat is already known from the Loki series."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not much.  Plot line was more of a mixed message where nothing is quite in the lead role.  Ant Man and Wasp dynamic/chemistry was about zero (lack of screen time) and quite frankly, hard to tell the age difference between Wasp and Janet.  All in all, I would skip this when it streams and in any event, wait for that and save the money on movie tickets."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Definitely the weirdest and most Disney Marvel movie. It has its moments here and there. Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer are great and nearly save the movie. Marvel needs to be delivered from Disney (think Netflix Daredevil series)
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A lot of folks have a soft spot for Paul Rudd, including myself.  He is just a great guy.  Ant Man is a really cool super hero.  The story was interesting, but while not a blockbuster, it was fun."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I gave this movie 5 star and I'll tell you why! It did its job and it did it fairly well. Not every Marvel movie needs to be Endgame. This movie has a fairly straightforward premise and goal, to show us a glimpse of the threat that is Kang The Conqueror, it did that and did it well. This is a perfect example of ""You can't always trust the critics"", or not that I ever do! I've seen un-fair comparisons to Thor: Love and Thunder, but this movie is very consistent with the other entries in the Ant-Man trilogy as far as tone, in fact if anything it's one of the more serious Ant-Man entries. Listen, I'm by no means saying this is a perfect MCU movie, it's not. It has its issues. But it is very far from the worst on that list (looking at you Captain Marvel.) Overall it's a very fun movie with a bigger purpose! Watch it!"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Decent action and pacing, but the same scenes seem to happen over and over again in the movie. Movie has No originality and no stakes."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie. I saw the first Antman and enjoyed that as well. I recommend the Antman series to all.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was an Avatar + Star Wars + Marvel mash up and was just too much. Supernatural forces in a supernatural world are just supernaturally boring. I know this is where Phase 3+ has been going for years, and is also why the movies are getting worse. There also appears to be a cultural gap with marvel and the rest of the world where it is okay for the teen character to say dick five times in just a few lines and berate her father who does nothing to respond. This is uncomfortable with your children and forces an uncomfortable conversation that word."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The story is incoherent. The Bill Murray segment makes no sense. The acting is woeful at times and the script is leaden, with very little of the humour that underpinned the earlier MCU films. The fx over-dominate the entire thing and for the first time in a Marvel film, I was wanting it to end.
Darren lifted it a little, but only because it was such a ridiculous concept. 
The trajectory for Marvel has been downward. I'll keep watching but I feel the Emprror's clothes are wearing very thin."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It had its moments but not the strongest MCU entry into the catalogue. I actually enjoy some comic relief in my action movies. It generally sits nicely in the first 30-45mins as the plot is being established. However, once the action hits top gear, there simply is no need for it. The little jelly character didn't need his ""I've got holes"" moment and the aimless chat between MODOK and Cassie ""don't be a d..k"" we're just unwanted moments. 
I'm aware of the MCUs agenda to significantly increase strong female heroes, but once again it seems a forced push. I love Wasp and Janet, but why did Cassie need such a big push up and the warrior she partners with to take down the bad guys? In such a busy movie, this gave Hank and Scott very little to do. 
Visuals were good and I think Kang is a great villain and one that should entertain for a few movies to come. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer were excellent."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's not mind blowing but it is one of the good Marvel films that have been released recently. It's better than Doctor Strange but it couldn't beat Black Panther. It's funny and has enough action scenes in it to qualify as a superhero movie. It sets up future Marvel films at the end and lets us know what to expect next. If you're looking for a good time, this one is the one to watch."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, good story line, really enjoyed father daughter byplay. Cassys character was very well played and the back story for Michelle Pffier was very good. Paul Rudd played his character as always very well."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and that is why I watch movies, for the enjoyment. It was well paced and the story was clear. If the reviewers are looking for factual, and things that makes sense, go watch a documentary.This is a movie based on COMIC characters, not actual science. Kang as the new Supervillain is interesting and I look forward for more of Kang the Conqueror in Phase 5."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film, critiques are obviously on par with ameba."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was a good one I will see it again
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"A movie with a lot of good stuff. amazing villain, good characters, Interesting worldbuilding and an interesting idea to put a small character against the biggest threat possible. But there are multiple flaws that some people have more problems with than me"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"after the dumpster fire that was phase 4, 'Marvel' is kicking off phase 5 with a banger. 'Ant-Man 3' is probably the best marvel movie since 'Spiderman: No Way Home'. Definite must see."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great visuals, compelling story and a number of good ideas. Loved the new world they introduced, loved the Modok ending and the epic soundtrack. Looking forward to see more about the characters and the new big MCU villan."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Majors excelled in the role of Kang/HE who remains and is exciting to look forward to in later projects. However, the rest of the story was abit janky with cheesy dialogues and clich√©s. The cgi is pretty good overall though. I would give a 3/5. Mid, watch it if you are bored/an avid marvel fan"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand why this movie got review bombed tbh. Just cause of the reviews i took my time to watch it. But glad that i eventually watched it in theatres, it was a great watch and i was entertained throughout. Jonathan Majors as the new big bad was exceptional. GO WATCH THE MOVIE PEOPLE!"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Stayed in character with Ant man. Was the best Ant man movie yet
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film is bullshit,except jonathan mayjor everything was bullcrap"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a great addition to the Antman franchise! I loved it!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, enjoyed it"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While an improvement over the last few Marvel films, it didn't do much to recapture the excitement of the pre-Infinity War MCU. Insofar as it is an ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" film according to the title, it is actually the original duo of those names who carry the film. Michael Douglass and Michelle Pfeiffer significantly outshine Paul Rudd who seems to be holding back the humor and heart. Even more regrettable is a script that all but eliminates any chance for Evangeline Lilly to show the audience her character. Sadly, the ""XCon"" gang (Michael Pe√±a, Tip Harris, and David Dastmalchian), who made the last two films in the series so enjoyable to watch, are completely absent. In sum, Jonathan Majors and his depiction of Kang are worthy of the price of admission. See it for him, Douglas, Pfeiffer, and... the ants!"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel has become ugly and noisy, there was no point of this movie, it meant nothing, it had zero stakes, I just feel so bad for the amazing cast who have to have this POS on their resum√©s because of contract obligations."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure why the critics are so hard on the film or marvel. Ant-Man 3 was one of the better Marvel movies to come out post Endgame and defy the best Ant-Man so far. Me and the other 3 people I went with, all enjoyed the film. It is not a perfect movie but it is an enjoyable Superhero flick."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Basically MCU star wars.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid Marvel film with excellent acting by Jonathan Majors as Kang.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Can't go wrong with Paul Rudd. It was just a good fun film that wasn't packed with an agenda.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Eu diria que √© um filme entre a linha do med√≠ocre ao bom. tem algumas inconveni√™ncias do roteiro e alguns clich√™s mas nada que agrida. so senti que a Hope foi meia que jogada de escanteio para a Cassie ter mais destaque, entretanto n√£o senti falta dela no filme. nota: 7,5. A atua√ß√£o do Jhonatan majors √© bem satisfat√≥ria."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Such a bad movie it's almost like a joke‚Ä¶
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow! Much better then I expected. Thrilling actions scenes and visuals. Felt like you were watching Marvels take on Dune and Star Wars. Watching Kang was like watching Darth Vader for the first time. I am so excited to see Marvel continue his story.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,muy buena secuela de la serie ant man y tambien del multiverso marvel muy entretenida
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantamania is excellent movie.I watched it yesterday.Not a single boring moment.Loaded with full of new and brilliant characters.Good story after infinty War.Its the Base for the next Avenger movies.Kang is brilliant and is the best villian so far,a more human approach to a villian like kang.His act is top notch ..5/5"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just another movie with jello aliens, corny humor and some bad guy that tries to destroy the world. It was ok but certainly nothing thrilling or interesting."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely worth watching on the big screen in 3d. The most visually stunning sci-fi movie I've ever watched and I don't say that lightly. Phase 5 is shaping nicely indeed. You ain't seen nothing yet. Don't believe the haters.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie explain how Star Wars a somehow long ago but also in the future.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Slow, kang is goated tho. Made me fall sleep. The ant ending is retarded. Free tickets pls"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its different in a lot of scenes from the regular ant man stories we know 
It remind us with Star Wars characters and setting 
Its a non stop action movie with a smooth funny lay out"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great addition to the MCU. The visual effects are amazing.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,It wasn‚Äôt perfect but it was fun.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Liked it was 2 hours only and that the quantum universe was unique artistically.  Plot was okay but typical Marvel ending.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Had its funny moments, but the cheesy, cringe moments are much more overpowering."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics were overly harsh towards the movie in my opinion. I had a good time watching it, no doubt Majors deserves an award for his performance, but I don't consider the plot bad, I think a lot of thought was put to almost every detail in the movie, it was a lot better than the previous Ant-Man and a decent openning to phase 5. One of the MCU movies I most enjoyed!"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the Tension we get from Scott at the movie's end. It is palpable.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great balance of humor and action. Feeds well into the next marvel story line!
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bored, the movie was bored And wrong"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,not very good acting or storyline
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, overall. Jonathan Majors is a brilliant actor. It is an Ant-Man movie, meaning it comes with the cheesy lines and his silly humor, but overall, this is a great film."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfectly enjoyable, and a great evolution of the Ant-Man and the Wasp series and further exploration of the Quantum Realm. Great villain, great score as well"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It gave off a lot of Star Wars vibes, it was fine and Im happy with some of the things come to light during the movie, but it was way better than Love and Thunder"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed.  Helps being together the timeline and multi verse.  Great humor.  A ton of action as a marvel movie should have.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Complete and utter sh1te
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Other than the 2 spider man movies, this is the best movie marvel has put out since Endgame."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie lacked a deep story, the movie was all cgi, it felt like I was watching a cartoon, and the whole storyline was just mushed together and it felt rushed, and they tried too hard to be funny with cheap unfunny jokes. Kang had a lot of potential, and Jonathan Majors was great, but the writers didn‚Äôt do him right, and unfortunately in result he wasn‚Äôt very menacing. There was no consistency in the storyline, everything was just happening at once, and the whole time they were either trying to be funny mixed in with trying to be serious, and it was just a mess. Marvel needs to hire new writers, and add more depth to their stories and characters, just like how they would pre endgame, I don‚Äôt know what happened after endgame, but they need to fix it."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great message in the movie fun too watch must see
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Feels like marvel are back on track with the wider universe. I didn't notice the bad cgi that most people are complaining about. Really funny and looking forward to Loki season 2
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you read Marvel Comics, this is an excellent movie. The Quantum Realm is weird, zany, strange place that I find very similar to the comic books. I think the team did a great job world building. Kang is awesome and the story is compelling. I have no idea what the critics are talking about - This is a story about a comic where a Man shrinks down to a bug size and sometimes much smaller to enter a weird micro-world. What were they looking for? The critics really suck on this one. I've watched every Marvel movie and this one hits my top 10."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was the best experience I've had a the movies in years! Def since COVID. It was like seeing Star Wars as a kid, thrilling. I have been excited about seeing a live version of Kang and the way they did it was so cool, looked just like the comics but better. Fascinating world creation and literally quite a trip. Wild ride, good humor, family friendly and fascinating to watch."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Johnathan Majors is a star in every sense. The whole cast was amazing.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great sum it up ANTS!!!
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was okay. Marvel introducing characters and then killing them off in a single movie is getting very old. Would love to see some long game rather than just one offs.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Feels like the MCU of old. Best MCU film since Spider Man: No Way Home. The cast delivers a great performance with witty writing and humor. The film absolutely delivers Kangs introduction and begins the story arc to Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars. Unlike most of Phase 4, where I was left wondering how those stories would tie in, Quantumania leaves no doubt."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is not a ground breaking film. Critics right it off because it doesn't add anything new, there is nothing innovative. Most of the acting, dialogue, and story isn't trying to do anything profound. 
What Quantumania is, is a really, really Fun film. The jokes are jokes, the action is amazing, the references to past films/content make it feel connected to the MCU as a whole. That's the reason Critics hate it, because it isn't meant for them. Quantumania is meant for you, to come in and switch of your brain, forget about the outside world, and just enjoy some jokes and action."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,The build up was too slow! We fell asleep!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is getting a lot of hate for no reason. It's a good story and introduction to Kang. The only thing I hated was MADOK. The dude was a CGI mess, joke, and literal punching bag throughout the movie when he is a serious threat in the comics. If he was removed from this movie or put in better, this movie would be like a 9.5/10."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a fun movie to watch. It had strange elements.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Oof, that was rotten"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,paul rudd being in a bad movie is painful
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie with great actors!!!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, just moved a little slow at points."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome special effects.  Lived up to hype and exceeded everything.   Loved it
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics reviews just prove they are out of touch with comic movies. This movie was the best antman movie yet. 
Over all it was a funny and entertaining movie even if they should have left the original ""peanut"" cast."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not impressed. Visuals were good, but Marvel is going down hill"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,This film was action packed. The the xf were the bomb.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It‚Äôs a good Ant-Man movie. Not great, but good. My eight year old had a hard time maintaining interest. He‚Äôs seen every Marvel movie and still had a hard time."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"some funny ,and fight war villians"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great moments of humor mixed in with action. I like the expanded family element with 3 generations of heroes.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed it and it sets up a lot of what‚Äôs to come!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Much better than Thor and dr strange, not quite as good as the spider man. Entertaining even if predictable at times, I felt it was original, Kang was super solid and the rest of the cast did their thing. Worth a theatre trip"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it a lot. I hated everything about M.O.D.O.K. Man that character was really mishandled. Other than that it was a fun and funny movie and hey any time films want to visit weirdo dimensions I'm down for the ride.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It kills me to give this film a low rating because I LOVE Marvel and I love Paul Rudd!! But the script for this one was...I don't even know what it was. Felt like there was a competition for middle schoolers to write the script and they chose the best option possible. I did laugh a few times, but half of the laughs were ""what the heck was that?!"" kind of laughs. This one and Thor's ""Love and Thunder"" movie both made me question how loyal of a Marvel fan I will be in the future. Used to never miss an opening night! But...this was just weird. Hope this is not the new expectation....Wakanda Forever was epic though, so I still have hope they can pull it back together in the future!"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie sets up well for the next sequel!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome!!!! The future is KANG
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,I didnt like how long the fight scenes are
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Can't say it was good, but also can't say that it was bad. Wasn't really the movie I was expecting it to be. 
Kang is really the only good thing about the movie. The traditional comedy from Ant-Man that we love is missing, and the pacing of the movie is just off.
Feels more like I was watching some sci-fi movie than a superhero movie. 
No real character development occurs among the main characters."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is an epic film. Was on the edge of my seat the whole time. This Kang is a threat! Loved the serious tone sprinkling in some humor. I laughed so hard. And for those who know. Baskin Robbins Scott, amazing! Hahaha"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Quantumania does exactly what rotten tomorrows says a 2 star movie would do, pass the time. Not the worst movie ever, it has some quips that will make you smile and the same fantastical CGI you can expect from Marvel, however the story telling is just not there. We spend the first hour of the movie talking about how we can't talk about what drives the plot of the movie. It lacked any compelling dialog and did not generate buy-in from the audience to the new characters or the new world they are trying to build. This movie follows what has been a trend rather than the exception since the Multi-Verse Saga began, it has a compelling concept that leaves you wanting more from the writing and actors (who were never given a chance with how simple this script is)."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Odd movie, such a difference from first"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it a whole lot.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don‚Äôt like because the movie started 30 minutes late.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,I understand it was a set up movie and the beginning of phase 5 but it was kinda weak. They stretched out a thin plot and had minimal interaction between the hero and the villain. As well as minimal usage of the villain
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the family working together the animation and graphics was well done and thought the villain was good. Didnt think they handled the ant idea well that could have been better integrated into the story.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed the movie overall, I wasn‚Äôt expecting a whole lot of hype like the Avengers movies but enjoyed it."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Pretty standard story with amazing otherworldly graphics. A fine setup for Kang and Phase 5.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant Man and the Wasp in Quantumania is enjoyable in that it is an Ant Man movie. He is a clueless ‚Äúsuper hero‚Äù I can‚Äôt say much without adding spoilers, but politically, this is a first for a Marvel film, fighting against a colonialist oppressor. There is a throwback sequences to Toby Maguires Spider-Man. "
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and not a real 'dark' feel to it. It was a good movie for my entire family. Did remind a lot of star wars at times and I am a Star Wars lover from the old days!
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was just okay. It didn't really make sense that Cassie out of nowhere mastered tech that not one but two seasoned scientists couldn't. Her character was annoying and I swear that just write kids in movies as a form of birth control.. I don't care to see the actress again and I feel like Marvel needs to take a break because all of phase 4 is bad. Side note Paul Rudd was awesome as always and he couldn't save this movie.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The reviews lie! Great Ant Man movie, would still of loved to see all the characters from the first two but overall great Marvel Movie"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good, not to deep a story or character plot and the movie knew when to end. Good all and all"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"funny, awesome just awesome. it was pretty cool.



ps: ants"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was ok,  but just ok."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"We had a blast, and we went with a group of people who are all different ages"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you go into the movie knowing that it will not have the same feel of the other Antman movies, you will enjoy the it. The movie flowed well and I loved the antman family. Johnathan Majors was amazing."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was epic.  I hate to say it, but it felt like a Star Wars movie, but in a good way.  I was entertained from start to finish.  I did come out with a couple questions, but I think they all lead to what's coming next"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a must watch. Missing Stan Lee but so worth it!!
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good action, funny, but mostly CGI"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a very good movie while comical in some scenes
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Action, humor, family fun! Love Antman!"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fun and kang was great. I think it was a good film and would recommend. I don't agree with the negative critic reviews, I think everyone's being too harsh."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"the villain character (s) will keep the series interesting.

Paul Rudd is still charming"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,I felt it was not as good as the other ones .  I wasn‚Äôt into the movie this time .. wasted my money
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Family friendly!!! Great plot, action packed, and highly recommend."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"At first it seemed bad, watched it again and I enjoyed it a lot more. The story is a little chaotic, and the plot feels a bit messy. Other than that it had plenty of beautiful things to admire and set up a great beginning for Kang."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was an amazing performance from start to finish,"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was terrible Daniel even get to see the movie. I want my money back because I didn‚Äôt even get to see the movie and I paid twice with you guys
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Makes no sense Star Wars and guardians rip off of characters but what‚Äôs worse it‚Äôs not fun 
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania was just okay. If hokey is what they were shooting for....they achieved it. Probably should see it since it is going to bigger things. This is not a good movie, lets hope this leads to bigger things. The Bill Murray cameo was awful, btw."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"We are full on in the MCU and even more than before if you haven't been watching almost everything since End Game including the TV shows you will not appreciate or get or enjoy this movie. It's overall a solid movie, entertaining but definitely not one of the best Marvel's movies out there. Kang is a great villain and he is definitely one I cannot wait to see more of"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Uninspiring and uninteresting, overall paint by numbers marvel movie, the ex-cons would've probably helped with the comedic factor, but probably wouldn't of saved the movie. Just watch it when it comes to disney plus."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It was entertaining‚Ä¶ Cassie actress wasn‚Äôt very good. Lacked chemistry with her Scott. I didn‚Äôt feel like they were actually related. Her performance felt forced. They should have kept the previous actress who played Cassie. The rest of the film was good. Some parts didn‚Äôt make sense‚Ä¶ like why would they get ‚Äútired‚Äù when they went ‚Äúbig‚Äù if they were still subatomic and not actually ‚Äúbig‚Äù like out on the surface where gravity takes a toll on being real Godzilla sized‚Ä¶ vs subatomic Godzilla size‚Ä¶ but it was entertaining enough. Missed the Scott lang crew ‚Ä¶ like not even a brief cameo at the beginning‚Ä¶ at least to claim you had a Mexican dude in the film lol smh 
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think it was more than ""Meh, it passed the time."" But It also wasn't quite ""oh yeah, you have to see it."" It was fun, like the Marvel superhero movies general are, and it provided some idea of what exists beyond the way we know it in our version of space and time. Do I think our imagination is limited? Probably. Did I think the special effects and images were awesome, absolutely. Did it remind me why I like ants? Yes. Did it ask any deeply philosophical or socio-political questions? No... except for maybe Scott Lang realizing for the first time after ""saving the day"" that he didn't know if this was the end or not."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fun, funny the character were great, the animation and special affects great."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"They made the crazy complex plot easy enough to grasp and over all, had a fun time watching."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Way too cartoony and lame plot. Very disappointed.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Well, I suppose some writers/director where sitting in a room thinking out loud when one says, ""do you think we could dethrone the captain Marvel movie from the top spot of the ""worst Marvel movie?"" That's when the it was heard ""We can!""  ""We can do anything if we DON'T put our mind to it!"" 
Congratulations. This exceeds all expectations of how bad a movie script can be.  Has to be an award for that.  I don't know where to start.  I will just say that if you want that rare feeling of anticipation of when the movie will be over, a desire to experience that sickening feeling as debate leaving before it is over verses sticking it out to see the end, this movie is for your.  It had to be intentionally made this way as no one can be this stupid.  wow just wow.  This does NOT deserve 1 star."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story line and actors
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good! Funny, fun, had a (original) Star Wars feel to it. Great in 3D!"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,This mcu movie was incredible because there was a lot of action in the movie
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not a masterpiece but decent , like every ant man movie, the jokes were pretty good.The weird egg man thing was creative , Khang was eh , not the best but meets the standards for Marvel these days."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Disliked Modok, liked Kang"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"(Potential spoilers: I feel sorta tricked, the trailers were deceptive) Hmmmm‚Ä¶ not a great start for Marvel's newest phase. While there are things to like in this movie the things that get under your skin never really let you enjoy them as much as you should. Marvel needs to really rethink their formula, or figure out what's missing from their once golden goose, because the last phase had more misses than hits. Well, not financially at least so I guess most of the ingredients are still in there. Jaw droppingly (awful) CGI and boring characters are the least of this movie's problems. And can we stop dunking on the current avenger members? Hulk and Antman get too much flak (I know it was mostly for humor but some of it seemed somewhat too critical) for saving the world."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel, has stay the course from Loki, to Dr. Strange, and now Ant Man and the Wasp,. if this the start of Marvel 5 it worth the ride."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Very fun movie that sets up the next phase well and keeps the charm of the first two ant men movies.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Another brilliant Marvel movie.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It takes a lot of effort to hate this movie - I think that it does a good job setting up the next big baddie, I thought Paul Rudd and his relationship with his daughter was strong.   Michelle P in particular was great."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was incredible from beginning to end. Ultimate introduction to Kang
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,The beginning was good then 35mins in it was kinda boring but then it got much better 7.8/10
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good moive I see thank u ant man
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,weird pace and a cheesy script.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great pop-corn movie on a Saturday Matinee!  Why not a full 5 stars...The 3D version could have been pushed more. That said, the ending credits are great in 3D."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie has its flaws but good movie
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it. It had just the right amount of humor, wholesomeness, and action"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie, i love all ant man movies"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Bom,mas faltou uns temperos a mais."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Utter gibberish. There is so much talent in front of the camera and behind it but the world they are working with is disintegrating. While not a new phenomenon, this perfectly illustrates what makes a Marvel project a self-refuting and substantively bankrupt enterprise"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Decent film nothing out of this world. Connects this movie with what will be the up and coming movies in the mcu. Corny jokes per usual, the acting was middle of the road nothing special besides Jonathan majors as the conquer. Jonathan was the bright spot to this film and made it watchable whilst the other characters the Modok were not enjoyable. If you enjoy marvelous movies and want to continue with watching them you will have to see this. Other note as well is the cgi at time was amazing and captivated your attention while othe times it was flat out bad and unnecessary to look the way it does."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is definitely worth the watch. Entertaining from beginning to end. The kids will love it. Almost as if they merge the star wars and marvel universe into one.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I love kang the conquerer  he basically carried the entire movie.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,It is an OK movie but not very inspiring.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"i spent 10 whole dollars on this movie and it was horrible. random stuff happens out of nowhere and the plot was horrible. barely made any sense, and it got to the breaking point when a square-headed goofy ahh guy appears and starts attacking people for no reason. marvel lost ideas many years ago and they should either make better movies or just quit. i'm done with this. it's horrible. never again."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Good story great visual effects
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a great movie!!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it a lot Can‚Äôt wait until the next one comes out
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The plot takes drive from the characters to render a discernable theme, that apparently critics can't see."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Highly entertaining!! Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors, and Evangeline Lily delivered great performances. Runtime was just over 2 hours, which felt perfect."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lixo de Filme. Completamente gen√©rico e sem Vida!!
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as the last two, but pretty close. Saw it in 3D. Good to see some 3D movies coming out again. Cast was great. action was fun, just a little slow in parts."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The first two Ant Man movies are a lot more fun. This one, while interesting to see a new world, just didnt have the flare like the others. Same formula."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible humor, poor character development with a disjointed storyline. Jonathan Majors has exceptional screen presence, but the storyline did not have the gravitas to match it. Paul Rudd is funny enough and doesnt need gimmicky jokes. Really disappointing third edition to what was a great franchise."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the movie was good, but when we think about the story we know from the comics, this movie was a joke. Was that supposed to be MODOK, and the way Kang was defeated, so they put in the movie that he killed lots and lots of avengers like Thor, a god, and he is defeated by ants?
Personally I like the movie because I ignore the stories from the comics to able to enjoy."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"21+ theaters was nice, no kids, now it seems they are longer a thing and that is sad. Not sure if I will be going back to a amc"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. As an intro to Kang, the movie did its job and setting up Cassie Lang as a future Young Avenger."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible.
No build up, no overarching theme, I want my money back"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Promotion of socialism
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have no idea why this movie is getting such mixed reviews.  The movie was fun, had plenty of humor, an awesome villain, and some really entertaining twists.  I mean, how high of expectations did people really have the third Ant-Man movie??"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,A much watch with your family!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"It wasn't as fun as the first two, but a lot of important things, for the future, occurred in this one. I'm really looking forward to seeing Kang again, and how he interacts with the other heroes."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I don‚Äôt know where all the bad reviews are coming from this ranks in the top marvel movies the only thing that seemed out of place was modok but to me it didn‚Äôt detract from the movie.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Always love Pauls comedic approach. However a lot of this story focused on Janets character more than any-man and wasp. Id see it again though.
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"if you're a marvel fan, watch it! it is part of the new beginning marvel will be coming in with the next phase. definitely a foundation layer. it's also a great entry in the ant man series."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Might be the worst movie I've ever seen.  I threw up in my mouth six times during the movie and it wasn't the popcorn.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dont listen to all the negative stuff. I went to see this movie thinking it would be a flop, but absolutely enjoyed it. Amusing, but not to the point it kills the tone. Major Star Wars vibes."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid film, story wasn‚Äôt as good as BP2 but they did a much better job of keeping the film moving along and exciting where BP2 tended ti really drag at times. Love how it sets the table for what to come!"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining.  Kang was a phenomenal character.  Thought this was a strong addition to the ant man series and a great introduction to Kang(s).
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,good movie had some funny jokes. all around good movie
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Really stupid movie.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie going ride!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Super funny and a fun ride!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love Ant Man. Michael Douglas is funny, Michelle Pfeiffer is hawt. MODOK LOLS."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie it's generic... bland... dull... boring. 
Not fair to Paul Rudd, he deserved a better script, a better story...
Marvel movies were good once... a long time ago."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Alot of now stop action.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"An entertaining movie. Best marvel movie ever? No but no where near what critics are saying. If you like marvel, youll like this movie."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you have been following the whole MCU series and movies so far, you will absolutely love this film. Some parts may be a bit corney..  but it's expected. Other than that, it was great. I should have spent the extra $ to see it in 3D. May just do that next weekend."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was okay there were some parts boring but it was decent
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is best seen in 3D, the Quatum Relm pulls you in and you will be on a visual journey with spectacular characters and fun for all!"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it but wish they brought back Luis
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Full of action! Love the humor it has
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought was a fantastic film! I laughed, I cried, and I just really enjoyed it!"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was good. Other Any man movies were better, but it was entertaining."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed to movie very much. Wish we had spent more time in the human world.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a good film, didn't have the same feel as the first two. But a enjoyable film that ties into the loki show and the prior ones. I would give it a solid B. The cgi looked fine."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Majors was the only highlight! Marvels formula is terrible and has gotten stale!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good fun adventure with fun new locals in the quantum realm and a decent baddie in Kang. Not sure why the reviews are bad, this is tons better than Thor Love and Thunder and on a par with other good Marvel movies, if not quite the best ones. 
Overall well worth a watch, good performances from all, especially Jonathan Majors."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought it was fun at parts and some of the action sequences are good but at the end of the day it felt like an empty soulless movie with uninteresting new characters and a complete over use of the Volume stage this world felt empty and hollow.    I loved Jonathan Majors as Kang !
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,not typical MCU but worth the experience
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Love marvel this is a must see
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's alright. I don't think I would have paid to see it in theaters if I had a choice. I have Disney plus. I should have waited to see it then. The best Ant-Man was the first movie, but the second was mediocre and this one is kinda lame. If you have Disney, save your money and wait"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel is definitely getting to the point where the movies are full of comic logic and tropes compared to previous versions.  And honestly, I'd say they're getting a little less obvious with the threat estimates of villains.  But overall, it's an entertaining movie that could stand some better dialogue, but does it's job of establishing Kang as a significant villain.
Also, if you don't like MODOK, you need to just lighten up.  He's a joke villain, always has been."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great! Well directed. Background on how Janet meets Kang and the conflict between the two. Good beginner performance from Kathryn Newtons character. Well done Marvel!
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow, easily the worst MCU I've seen for a while, while Wakanda forever was god awful and it was god awful, this movie was even worse. Casey Lang; what a ridiculous bad character terrible acting for her. Kang was cool but still no real threat. This entire movie just shows why the MCU has peaked and that was sometime ago, and yeah you guessed it the CGI was terrible"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun movie that explores a previously mostly ignored realm except as a plot device.  I love that that gave Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer more time in this movie.  Jonathan Majors is a great Kang, you want to hate and like him at the same time.  Another Marvel studios triumph."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,I really enjoyed the first one. The second wasn't too bad. This sucked.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Great fun. a mind bender!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. It was action packed from beginning to end. We enjoyed watching the actors, they were all amazing. The ending left us with the thought that there will be another part to this movie. It is definitely a movie that anyone who enjoys Marvel movies should see."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was entertaining.  Not as superhero as Marvel's normal movies. Had some good humor and a surprise guest.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad special effects, the plot is tedious, Ant-Man is a secondary character and the villain is laughable."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm a big marvel fan and recently had been feeling like the films and series were going downhill... But this. This really was a good film! Made me excited and giddy for the next couple marvel projects!
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,movie had little action. I fell asleep
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not terrible but not good. Kang was definitely a highlight but not much else that really stuck out. Kathryn Newton wasnt bad as Cassie
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too much CGI and not enough character development
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Why do people like Jonathan Majors so much? He's no Robert De Niro, just a standard okay actor, average, nothing special. Ant-Man 3 is a disappointment. The quantum realm could have been something brilliant, unique and deeply entertaining, bit it turns out it's another Star Wars world that escaped from that IP. The plot is lame and inconsistent. Kevin Feige annoyingly keeps telling everyone how proud he is of every single new production and how great everything still is, but we all know phase 4 is a disaster and 5 started off really really bad with this big miss."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Even though the action took a while to begin i feel like they didn't rush it and it worked very well. There were some cliche moments but i didn't hate them. Kang was insane awesome and violent. The only thing missing in this movie was lack of the comedy like in the other 2 movies... We all wanted Luis to walk us through another plan üò≠
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Decent story and action, I didn‚Äôt feel like I wanted to fall asleep like some other films"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure why this film is getting a bad score, it's one of the better recent films. Yes the visual effects could be better but love Paul Rudd and Michelle Pfeiffer is as brilliant as her cat women days."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent storyline. Marvel worthy
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The new chapter in the Ant-Man trilogy cannot be defined as a ""film"". Normally, when I go into a cinema to see a Marvel film, I'm tempted to see it, but this ""film"" didn't satisfy me at all. It was like seeing an advertisement of McDonald's in collaboration with some Bollywood film studio. It gave me the impression that dear Kevin Feige needed to take a cruise and was 20 cents short so he commissioned this production. The script was a paste copy of the typical Marvel model. The final battle sequence was like they took the word file containing the End-Game script and changed the verbs and nouns! I was very bored! Marvel do something or your MCU will be destroyed by the DC Cinematic Universe or some Indiana production house!"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I saw the critic score so low, I was worried and skeptical about seeing this movie myself. I loved it!! Great comedy, action, and of course, KANG!! Johnathan Majors really carried this movie and I'm so excited to see what's next with Kang."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Honestly think the ‚Äúcritic‚Äù reviews were too much. I enjoyed it for the most part.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fun movie, full of comedy and action. It also introduces us to a whole new world they should take credit for, similar to the inspiring world of avatar. 
Love it."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,ant man was great can't wait for what next
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it. It was an action-packed movie that was well-paced. The flow of the story worked, and the special effects were very well done. There were a couple of scenes where I thought I was in a Star Wars movie... but that just made me laugh. Overall, a great move and a must see to understand where Marvel is taking the MCU."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun and excited to see,"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Great design and world building.   The filmmakers focused on the least interesting story in the movie.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Es muy buena Marvel te amo
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film with more depth than recent Marvel outings. I like wherr this could lead.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"good, but not as fun as the previous two ."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Star Wars meets Marvel
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I don‚Äôt care about the reviews and I don‚Äôt really care about the rotten tomatoes are about the Ant-Man 3. It has really funny things in the film. I would recommend this movie to see in theaters
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"WTF so called critics.  
Paul Rudd is delightful. He brings the perfect balance of comedy and drama to his character.  It was refreshing to see Michelle Pfeiffer do more in this movie. Kathryn Newton was great as Cassie. I wasn't sure if I would like the casting change but was pleasantly surprised. 
There were a few Star Wars-esque cantina character moments that went on longer than needed, but aside from that it was a fun entertaining Marvel movie leaving me wanting more."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Cool special effects. Drawn out story.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"My wife and I thought it was an excellent movie, and addition to Marvel Cinematic Universe. There was a small stretch where the plot had to fill in back story towards the middle/end of the movie, and that caused the movie to lull slightly. Overall, we would recommend this movie, and we would watch it again."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Unimaginative. Boring. Not even this movie could shrink my disappointment in it.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Great family movie!! Loved it all
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,It took a while to pick but it was ok and had a few funny parts.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was so boring, I almost sleep, but the production it's absolutely great."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too many special effects. Couldnt get the story line from the last movie.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the film, and it piqued my interest in learning about the next story line for everyone."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Good special effects and nice mix of action and likable characters with an interesting villain
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was great. All characters had good roles in the story.  Kang was an absolute stellar villain and the plot twist in the post credits was unimaginably insane to see play out on the big screen. The movie, though, did have a few flaws like the absence of reasonable pacing and emotional scenes. I can't wait to see what Kevin Feige and Marvel has to offer."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Was just what I expected.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"After alien invasions, the snap and the blip it's good to see heros are less shocked even by strange and baffling life forms but rather adjust to it and work though it.  The concepts were great i.e. shroedingers catamd infinite possibilities and Kang was AMAZING.  This movie further extends the possibilities for the MCU far into the future allowing new stories to be told and in that way the movie is a bit of a vehicle for the future more than a plot unto itself.  Still - had some laughs, some great action, great colors and creative scenes - a bit of a Star Wars cantina feel.  Also a good subplot about society and getting the older generation to stay engaged with the younger gen to keep participating in positive change rather than resting on their stories of old."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Predictable writing, seen this kind of story before"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great intro to Kang and the Quantum Realm.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a very epic, fun and colorful film. In some ways it's more of a Star Wars kind of film more than a superhero film. Most of it takes place in the ""Quantum Realm"", which is essentially a sci-fi universe full of aliens and advanced tech. The level of humor was just right and Paul Rudd is a very likeable hero. All in all, highly recommended."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! it is a great Kick-Off to Marvel's Phase 5!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"The thing about this one is it's definitely an ACTION picture. Sure, there's a bit of drama and a bit of humor, but what it's about is ACTION. And you don't have to EXPECT anything else from an action movie, do you? Once this starts moving, it keeps moving. And that's a good thing. Kang is indeed a fine villain to add to the MCU, and the performances are stellar (Michael Douglas and Bill Murray are standouts, as they always are). Well worth seeing."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The combined use of alternate timelines and time travel opened the door for massive logic plot holes, especially the ending.  And the ""Probability Storm"", just lazy writing.  Worse Marvel movie ever.  Ranks right next the DC's dismal Birds of Prey."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"both adults and child were bored by this latest entry in the MCU, missing the humour and charm of the earlier films"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Surprising, imaginative, funny and exciting!"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was action pack and a joy to watch.  Glad it was not trying to push some agenda that should not be in movies anyway. Loved the movie.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie to watch! Colors, actresses, actors, everything was eye catching!"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Good introduction to next phase. Just the right amount of comedy.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Majors as Kang is the best villain in the MCU since Thanos. This movie feels like Star Wars in the MCU. However, the story feels messy, and any serious scene is taken off track by jokes. The family drama is rich, and you actually care about the characters."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a super movie!!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I think people are simply taking themselves too serious when they are trying to look at this movie and the grand scheme of things it's simply a movie go watch it enjoy it or not I thought it was amazing. You have to look at these movie is in a larger ovbrawl's game knowing that something is going to come from the overall tale of a combined story and that It's what you have to depend on I feel that this movie was fantastic.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's fine... I'd watch at home.
Jonathan Majors' Kang was the only Character in the movie. The rest feel numb, non-reactive posters instead of actual people.
The action is fine, The cgi mostly very good, with the bad effect here and there,
Sadly, because of issues with editing, writing and acting, I'd say the main issue must be overall direction."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,There's some interesting plot holes like why doesn't Scott get big and just step on everybody. But it's a cool movie
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pacing was strange. Overall felt more like a star wars movie, except it was out of place! MODOK CGI looks dumb AF, Marvel's VFX team has really tanked over the past few years. Did not do justice to Kang's true power. Also, he was defeated by ANTS!! what a joke! 

No wonder there was very little revealed in advertising for this film, they didn't want people to see what is really was. This may be the last Marvel movie I watch in a while."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horton Hears A Who! 

Scott was lame through the whole movie...

With the multiverse nothing is ever final, no death, or no real consequences.  

It feels like Marvel has neutered their male leads in the last few movies."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Buena pel√≠cula, este film demuestra que Marvel no decepciona, buenos efectos, demuestra el desarrollo del personaje, un villano muy bien trabajado con mucho potencial."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful. A new low with the current run of Marvel movies. We should be demanding more from the Marvel juggernaut. They may prop up the industry but at the expense of real imagination and craft. I can't fault the VFX - these movies excel at this aspect and almost doesnt even need to be mentioned in conversation anymore. We know that with Marvel, you're getting top-level VFX - it's the other pillars of filmmaking that are troubling here. Flat, lengthy, unmotivated dialogue scenes (if Fincher can take a static dialog scene between lawyers sat at a table riveting and dynamic, then why cant we do that in a movie where the stakes are much higher?), Seen-it-all before action scenes (this movie is truly about scale - we're expected to fathom the destruction of entire timelines), and complete tonal shifts. This company can pay for anything. Please pay for the best in writing and direction."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just enough to keep mcu fans wanting to know what comes next, with solid action and visual effects. To a casual movie watcher, they probably will mot enjoy this movie because of the lack of storytelling and character development in play. MODOK was a pleasant surprise, and overall the movie exceeded my expectations. Didn‚Äôt feel like a cut and paste compared to Dr.Strange and Thor Phase 4 movies. This movie did its job as the first Phase 5 movie, and set up future storylines coming down the road."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Neat to see more of the Kang saga unfold.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Pleasantly surprised. Making a third movie of anything that doesn‚Äôt suck is tough and this is one of the better third installments I‚Äôve seen. Far better than latest Thor. Expands the universe and balances humor with the gravity of what is at stake. Would see this again.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was AWESOME with Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Evangeline Lilly!! Including Bill Murray with the actor Jonathan Majors as Kang who brought his A GAME!!"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,as an introduction to Kang it was great but the rest of the movie made zero sense
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"The cgi was great, bad plot but kang carried this movie so hard"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania gave me back the marvel fan excitment feeling i didn't have since Endgame. Scott, Hope, Cassie, Hank and Janet proved that they are the dearest family in the MCU. The characters were just beautifully synchronized and committed to helping each other throughout the entire movie. I loved that Katheryn was able to deliver the same personality Cassie had when she was played by Abby. Also, the twist in the end when you can see the Wasp in her full powers to save Scott, she showed beautifully why her name is also in the title of the movie: there's no Ant man without the Wasp."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Best MCU film since phase 3. So it's a step in the right direction imo
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you want a goated villain, watch this movie. Johnathan Majors is a monster in this."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Plot was bad, like - really bad. They totally messed up Kang The Conqueror character. CGI was also really painful thing to see especially in mcu project. Looking back at mcu movies from few years ago this movie is an embarrasment for Marvel. I won't even say a thing about ending - yeah, that bad. It's really sad thing to see that mcu is now more like quantity > quality."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"mish mash mess of a story and CGI overload , wish i had not bothered"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel movies are just like eating a Big Mac. Predictable, bland, corporate, void of any originality, and you feel sick after consuming it."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sloppy.. This movie was just a build up for the Kang character. It's not often that I can't finish a movie but this film was brutal to watch. These marvel movies are getting worse and worse. DC, here's you chance!"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hilarius, awesome action scenes and great special effects!"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,SO GOOD! Modok was AMAZING!!!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic üòäüëå enjoyed it fun, well paced and highly imaginative- and surprisingly funny! Marvel movies take note Ant-Man Quantumania is pure entertainment."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"üç™
   I feel like MCU movies are like shortbread cookies at this point. The base and core are three cheap, simple ingredients: butter, sugar, flour, or in this case: a movie star, special effects, and setting up the next thing. They're each cut in the same mold, all baked in a rigid amount of time, maybe the icing and sprinkles are shiny and different, but the base are all the same, and no matter the flavour of the different icing for the different projects the overall experience feels the same- a sugar cookie.   
Instead of a a variety of a pineapple macadamia cookie, then chocolate cinnamon walnut etc.  üççüå∞‚Ä¶..one second I'm hungry

   ü•© The base of your meal: cake, steak, etc. 
is the base of your story. All seasonings (vfx, action scenes) serve that base just like an icing with a cake, or salt with a steak. You only need a little to accentuate it. You can't have 90% icing/design and a bad base‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
But sure it'll look cool


    I went to the theatre with my brother after not seeing him for two years, the movie theatre used to hold some of our favourite memories. We were excited to view Avatar, Puss in Boots, The Whale, or any of the other films nominated for best picture, films brimming with passion, but instead ALL 12 Audotoriums were taken up by Ant-Man‚Ä¶..We sighed at eachother and slipped out- ""let's get this over with"". We used to watch each MCU Film opening night for a decade straight‚Ä¶but now‚Ä¶..

Positive: The visuals, character and world design, Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors charisma.  (Not that the characters or world was explored or connected with) 
 
Negatives:
When it comes to showing not telling almost everything is told, especially the world, and Kang. 
There's no passion present, no direction, no magic of the MCU or fun, no character work, no wonder for the world, no themes or topics, character consistency is off. There were never any sense of threat, fun, emotion, or interest. 

Without the gloss of Jonathan Major, Kang is weak on every other level: writing, intelligence, etc. For being the next great threat, any other single Avenger could defeat him, and maybe not even that since a group of ants do. 

A side villain has no place here and is treated like a McDonalds happy meal toy.  

Kassie has shortcuts to being capable at everything and faces no conflict. 

Hope is treated like a side weapon. 

I don't understand why the heroes didn't lose in this film, with Scott sacrificing it would've brought so many benefits: cementing any themes of family and ""how the little guy makes a difference"", promising Cadsy he's never going to leave again, they have all these plans for the future then he sacrifices himself setting up Hope and Cassy representing a theme, and the price it takes for this fight and the values they have. He doesn't keep with her his life, he gives her morals, a bar and an example of his life and a boost heading forward for hers‚Ä¶.she'll always feel like a little ant is on her shoulder 
He shows her not the smuggler and low life he stayed as, but the hero and FATHER he became. Both a role model. 
He states ""I don't have to win, we just both have to lose."" And then immediately is saved. 
It's a shame to have a movies studio that doesn't care for story, characters, emotion, exploration, fun, passion, and simply‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶setting up the next thing‚Ä¶.  
   The next empty thing that'll take up 20 auditoriums blocking out other artists work full of passion, love, effort, color, themes, and craft."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,This just wasn't it. Every cool scene or idea they had is just ruined by some cringe scene or some random plot point made out of thin air. I was not entertained :(
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Paul Rudd is always good
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's fine. I think critics have stopped being fair to this franchise because they feel it is oversaturated, but there is nothing so bad about this movie that I can't recommend it. It's got all the same problems as the other Marvel movies. It's got all the positives too."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,There were some flaws. Especially some scenes with Darren Cross aka M.O.D.O.K. Regardless though it's a great film. Especially since it has a great main antagonize. Johnathan Majors kills it as Kang the Conqueror!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"If the point of the movie was to be entertained, it succeeded for me.  Was the CGI the best we've seen from Marvel? I don't think so, but at the same time it wasn't horrible.  I thought it was a good intro for Kang the Conqueror."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Thoroughly enjoyed this movie!
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was terrible, probably the worst movie I've seen in years. A mix of bad acting from certain characters, pointless storyline that could have easily been avoided, poorly done CGI, and a not-quite-imaginative-enough interpretation of what a quantum real would be like really brought it down lower from scene to scene for me. I'm guessing it's good for people who want to just sit and watch something or are easily amused like children or for people who are already so far up Marvel's butt they're in the quantum realm."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Honestly is the movie great...no. But I think it is a fun run ride. What did bother me was Modok's cgi face. When the mask stay on I was ok with it. But when he pulled the mask off. I was like man that's bad. Cassie did get on my nerves a bit. when I got towards the middle and end of the movie she did grew on me. Kang's mask in certain scenes didn't look right to me. But only in certain scenes.

Jonathan Majors as Kang...GREAT FREAKIN' JOB I love the tone and the presence Kang very much. There are some comedic moments in this movie. But from watching the trailer I knew the movie was going in a serious direction. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer another great job by them as well."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a huge Ant Man franchise and MCU fan, this is one of the most disappointing films in the MCU. For whatever reason, they sucked the fun out of this franchise. Kang and Janet are fantastic but the title characters in Scott and Hope don't really have any sort of character development. None of the heroes outside of Janet are on a journey of any kind for their characters. They're just going where the plot forces them to go. The drastic change in Cassie's personality doesn't really make sense if you go back to the first two films and the teases they have in those movies, and that's a problem in general. There's not a lot of connective tissues to the previous films outside of the characters being used. It's just strange how much they ignored and then expected people to forget what was said or done in the previous films. Very disappointing film overall and probably one of my least favorites of the MCU."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"not worse than thor love and thunder, but still bad"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Meh. I love Jonathan Majors, but the script he was given didn't do him any favors. Modok,oh my,,he's supposed to be  menacing not a comedian. Paul is Paul.

Writers should be told to pick up a comic book and read all the series to make those characters as menacing as possible.A wasted opportunity IMHO."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel characters evolve and so do their choises. The argument for a low score in this movie is that it aint as funny as the previous ones is what i expect from someone that watches random movies and if its not what he thought it had to be then its wrong. Great movie, great start of the new phase and some general culture (from life and from marvel) needed to understand... maybe that is what some people are lacking..."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"La verdad esta pelicular solo es, Cassie abre portal, todos dicen que Kang es malo, Modok es un chiste, Janet y Hank se cuentan lo que paso en 30 a√±os, y un deus ex machina para el final, en resumidas cuentas, aburrida y sosa, no la recomiendo."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Interesting story and great effects.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the movie and the humor in it also.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was great! Good action, characters reminded me of star wars it at pretty cool."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant story line, graphics and entertainment. We were spell bound from the start to finish"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If the entire likability of Ant-Man within the MCU was because of Rudd's stellar comedic talent, then it's a very bold choice to depart from that tone. In fact, it's bold to spend so little time with the titular characters. I'm not entirely sure what Quantumania was trying to do, as I feel the wider phase 4 arc is no further progressed than when Loki ended from a Kang perspective. 

There's a lack of wit and charm, and while the emotionally resonant moments are a nice touch, I feel like the film doesn't really know what it's trying to be. It's not funny, it's not exciting, the stakes aren't high and there's no suspense. Sure, stuff goes on, but I was hoping for an Empire Strikes Back ""we got outclassed by Kang"" vibe, but left the cinema feeling particularly empty. If anything, the best part of the film was the second after-credit scene.

A definite ""wait until it's on Disney+"" instalment."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,I fell asleep.  It was all over the place.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Movie... Book your calendar and watch a movie with your friend & family.

"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really liked this movie. Wasn't sure how I felt about it immediately after, but the more I thought about it, the more I enjoyed it. This was definitely the best Ant-Man film so far. For the first time, it really felt like an Ant-Man story where Scott acts heroically and is the type of character who should be in the Avengers. In the first two, it felt like the original Ant-Man(Hank Pym) would have been the more exciting character to see a movie about. Although, I do think the first two films work better as comedies, because they are genuinely funny, I felt myself more engaged with this movie and genuinely excited to see how it would end.

I think this movie is getting a lot of unfair criticism, specifically because of the huge expectations that have been created for it, and the desire for a return to form after the seemingly lackluster fourth phase. I found myself a victim of this at first, as I was definitely expecting a different ending to this movie. But the more I thought about it, the more I understand why the movie was wrapped up in the way it was, as opposed to being left completely ambiguous like a ""Civil War,"" or ""Infinity War,"" before it. 

This is the first movie in Marvel phase 5 and because of that, it needs to simply set the tone for what this phase is going to be about, without giving away too much. I think it did a great job of giving an exciting, entertaining movie, that establishes an intriguing villain. Not only can this movie stand on it's own, it also gives just enough information about what's to come throughout this phase and the next, to leave the audience wanting more, without revealing, to the point that it's a forgone conclusion where the characters will end up. I can appreciate that. 

Overall, enjoyable experience!"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A great introduction to Marvel Phase 5 and the Multiverse Saga. Great performances from the cast and Especially Jonathan Majors as Kang.  However, there were some flaws, such as the movie being rushed, the script not being sensational, and areas where the CGI and editing does not look great. Overall, the movie was enjoyable and suitable for the fans."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie characters were excellent, Cassie was well chosen for the role she played. The ending was great, and can't wait for the next episode."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,solid visuals mixed with strong comedic elements and action. Jonathan Majors is a great addition to the MCU.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are dumb, great MCU movie"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kept me entertained, story could've been a Lil better. But on the whole I loved it."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Antman stays full strength when he shrinks--that's the point--but a shrunken down Kang is just a shrunken down Kang. By only showing Kang in the ""Quantum Realm"" where everyone is so small that TIME flows differently, they take away all of Kang's primary powers over TIME.

Unforgivably bad premise akin to ""Hey let's have Lex Luthor shrink Superman"" because you can't figure out another way to challenge your character. Only showing Kang while already shrunken to a quantum scale is unforgivable. There is no Kang in this film."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors single-handedly brings clarity, intensity and focus to this chapter of the MCU, which had been floundering a bit. He's worth it alone. Overall, solid fun. I don't understand the negativity. This was far more enjoyable than Eternals, Strange, or Thor Love & Thunder. To critics of MODOK's CGI: get over yourselves, it's supposed to be a joke. That's always been a tongue-in-cheek character (the name, hello) and his ridiculous look was fitting. To critics of ""too much green screen"": I think you vastly underestimate the extent of greenscreen use in all of these films. This one is no different. Embrace it!"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It was everything I would want out of an Antman movie.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Please, please don't believe all the negative reviews and talk about this movie!  It's a total snow job.  I don't know if it's DC fans doing it or just internet trolls with nothing better to do.  QUANTAMANIA IS A GOOD MOVIE!  Lots of action, interesting new characters, and a look into a new threat to the Marvel universe in the guise of Kang the Conqueror.  I will agree with the critics of the sfx, but mainly surrounding the work around the totally computer-generated character of M.O.D.O.K.  I've never liked the character in the comics, and this version does nothing to really change my mind.  For such a ""threatening"" and ""dangerous"" character, he's always defeated relatively easily and usually serves as a bit of comic relief rather than being a real threat to contend with.  And for those of you who find it super difficult to stay in your seats when the credits roll because of that large soda you downed at the start of the movie, there are 2 end credits scenes that are completely missable.  In other words, you can easily miss them without spoiling any future movies or Disney+ shows.  Sure, there are some tie-ins, but nothing really major.  Go to the bathroom and relieve that bladder.  Once the movie starts streaming or you buy it on bluray, you can watch the end credit scenes and see that you've really missed out on very, very little.  Other than that, the 3rd Ant Man movie scores really high in my book.  No, it's not as good as the first 2, but it's very, very different.  Ant Man is now much more sure of himself as a powered hero and he takes a more serious approach to things than he did in the 1st 2 movies.  Yes, I'd like to see more laughs, but like I said, this is a much different story.  It's more along the lines of Endgame than other Marvel movies where there's a lot of room for humor.  If you go expecting Ant Man 1 or 2 redux, you're going to be disappointed.  If you go to see a superhero movie where there's lots of action, explosions, deaths, and cool hero/villain dialogue, you're in for a treat!"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great cast, entertaining and great venue"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie gave me VERY FEW reasons to leave the theater excited for Marvel movies going forward. The dialogue throughout the whole movie was so poorly written it made my head spin. Majors and Rudd were great as always. However, not even their performances could lift this movie to passable levels for me. Don't even get me started on the STUPID ant portion they tossed into the movie again. The beginning was okay, the middle was boring and the end was TERRIBLE."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Extremely cartoonish yet knows when to have serious dramatic moments, Jonathan Majors is the best part of the film with his terrifying portrayal which rivals Thanos in cosmic horror. Paul Rudd is still compelling as Ant-Man but his family falls a little flat for me, the action is a mix of generic Marvel cgi fighting with some Ant-Man powers with one spectacular Ant-Man vs Kang fight in the climax! Overall its a fun popcorn flick"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The pink gooey guy with no holes named Veb. It brought a tear to my eye when he finally got holes.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was actually good for marvel phase 5 opening, i enjoy it and it's way better than Thor love and thunder, really like the comedy, little bit boring but it's good"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A good movie good dynamic, there was so some cringe moments but also great ones, Kang was great until the third act of the movie 
But also Kang was to strong too be an antman villain in my opinion 
For me 7/10"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall a good start to phase 5, good action and introduction to Kang (apart from Loki). A bit slow at times and continued dodgy CGI."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'm a lifelong Marvel fan. Been reading comics since I was 12. This... this is just awful. The MCU is officially an embarrassment.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,loved everything about it
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel keeps putting down the established characters.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Good generic visual , boring and confusing story. All MCU movies now are becoming very generic and shallow ."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie relied way too much on CGI.  However, some of the CGI scenes were amazing!"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible writing/script. Acting was carried by Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors. FAR to many jokes and just took its self un-serious. Felt I could have written a better story
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pure entertainment in a good form. Great visuals, action and cast. As innocent and light-hearted as Paul Rudd can be :D"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Visually awesome. Wanted more action. Felt like all the action was towards the end.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the story line as a marvel fan it gave me what I wanted
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is crazy go and watch it
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it. Experiencing the quantum realm is great and thrilling.. Kang is extraordinary...
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,First half an hour was a waste but pretty decent after that I was happy with the characters and the villain too. Kang is the right villain for the MCU but the wrong one for ant man
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was unfortunately the worst MCU movie in several years.  We have to stop letting Jeff Loveness cook. 

While the MCU has never been short on witty one-liners, it almost feels as though the Quantumania plot is secondary to its juvenile bathroom humor.

I appreciate this film's ability to poke fun at the absurdity of the MCU, but Jeff's unserious tone has left the franchise in an odd spot with its biggest villain.  

I need to see Kang Dynasty move towards at least a Guardians balance of humor and seriousness, or I fear the franchise is on course for failure."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie should be named ""Kang: Quantumania""."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible movie... stupid impossible-tofollow wording about quantic science, no story, no tension, no real hero, no villain, Disney-like teen characters, old blockbuster actors (come on... Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer in a 2023 action movie?). I can't belive this horror was actually made and released."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Summer blockbuster in the winter!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"A good fun. not as bad as they say, well as good as it should be."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,It wasn't that bad for me
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie better than lots of phase 4 shit, it's a great antman film with a few stupid things but it's compensation for phase 4 so for me it worked"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was an entertaining movie although it did not live up to the standards of other Marvel films - as the beginning of phase 5 I was expecting more. Overall enjoyable and entertaining and would recommend
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Acting was great however, movie was too 'busy' and way too much to keep up with. I prefer more 'reality' settings as opposed to 100% special affects. I much prefer the first two installments."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is great. Loved the high energy and really love seeing women kick butt!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another film that for me shows that you need to take what the critics say with a pinch of salt. Funny, but not full of silly jokes like Love and Thunder and a masterful performance from Majors. Really enjoyed this."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Greaqt special effects. Moved pretty quickly
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"we enjoyed the movie, spectacular and imaginative quantum world, the story is about family that stick together to battle evil, not sure why it has a lower score among critics."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly just a fun adventure movie, I laughed a lot and everyone in the cinema did too, loved loved loved Kang and i can't wait to see more of him. Great improvement in the CGI. My only but is that they made MODOK funny, should had been deformed, intelligent and deathly."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really great movie, I'm not sure why the critics are bashing on it so much. The only real criticisms I have is that the quantum realm's appearance almost doesn't work in Live action because how out of this world it is, but that doesn't really ruin the movie. Also, Hope doesn't really have much to do in this movie. If you took her out, not much would really change; which is extremely disappointing"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of those movies where the reviews of critics really do not matter. Isn't the basic idea of a super hero movie supposed to be consisting of a fun experience? Visuals are great, story is simple, nothing is vague and it makes sense"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Film is something new like antman  and the wasp  qautmania is werry awesome film and i love it
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,the special effects where great movie ok never was a moment where I was thinking this movies awesome but it kept me interested.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are way off on this one. While a lot of the humor didn't land (which is kind of jarring for an Ant Man film), I haven't had this much fun at an MCU movie in a long time. The quantum realm was wild and weird in the best ways. Kang was truly terrifying. The action sequences were exhilarating. There was a real sense of scope and danger. And it all worked as a (pretty much) self contained film. MODOK's CGI was atrocious, yes, but he was also the best punch line of the film. After Thor Love and Thunder I was ready to throw in the towel because I couldn't take the MCU seriously anymore. This movie struck the right vibe between serious and humorous for me and recaptured the magic. Highly recommended."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"not the best but not even the worst it is a good and enjoyable movie 
at least better than thor love and thunder üòÇ"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A little too long.  Funny parts.  I dont love all the multi universe story lines with avengers, so I feel all the newer movies containing that are not as good."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel didn't showed a big effort, the story is not that good, some scenes showed lack of quality."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"ONE TIME WATCH 
KANG IS USELESS IN THIS FILM HE KILL ALL AVENGERS 
AND HE KILLED  BY ANT"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Great correlation to other Marvel streaming TV shows.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA is really an amazing movie to watch with family and kids. Good Potential Visual and Good Backup story as they needed to focus for the main course.But some scenes maybe improved,cause we saw greate scenario of Paul Raud Perfoming superuror action play in Antman 1,Civil Wars and Endgame Movie.
Any way really enjoy the movie and waiting for to buy the Blue ray disk after several months when it will be available."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,You want a fun movie to watch? This is it. A fun movie meant to give more information of the new big bad wolf of the MCU. Not only does this movie explain Kang's mission and background well without it being another typical villain monologue backstory but it also  balances fun and serious throughout. Though it does seem like the movie could have explored and better explained the the quantum realm it does it job of introducing Kang (again) and setting up the future for the MCU.  Plus who can ever get tired of Paul Rudd. 7/10 would watch again
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought they did a fantastic job with Kang. Jonathan Majors did a great job! The movie in some parts definitely felt like Star Wars which is a good thing depends how you look at it. I also thought that they did MODOK dirty; the way they portrayed him wasn't the best. I also think that even though Kang did a fantastic job, I don't think they should've put him as the main villain in an Ant-Man movie, mostly because of who he is in general as a character, that's just my opinion. Although even if they technically introduced him in Loki as He who remains. I think they did a great job really introducing and showing who Kang really is and what he can do."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Liked that they continued the story. I like Paul Rudd. 

Wish they had Luis and security crew. The guys he met in prison. They are funny. 

Movie was just ok. I like done and two much better."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,If there was truly a multiverse I would go to all of them to tell other versions of myself to not watch whatever this was.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie doesn't deserve the ratings critics gave it. No ulterior motives here. Just entertaining storytelling and a solid piece of world building for the MCU.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is extremely good exposition heavy, constantly trying to tell instead of show major character moments and plot points. If that wasn't enough, this movie is yet another example of a character not being beaten, but defeating themselves due to out of character stupidity. Multiple times, Kang could have and should have defeated our protagonists if only he didn't change his mind for unknown reasons or forget he had certain abilities. That being said, Kang is still the shining part of the film. For the first 1 1/2 hours, he's either a looming threat or stealing the show. 

The worst part of the film has to be the characterization of either Hank or Janet. They hide things for no reason, preach platitudes with no substance, and seem to be nothing by plot devices to facilitate macguffins."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyable and entertaining. There were plenty of laughs as well as audacious action sequences.  If you are a critic or ""serious film enthusiast"", why are you watching it anyway....it's just for fun!"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a huge MCU fan... 

the magic is gone. This was another Phase 4 film disguised as a Phase 5 start."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Phaze 5 movie 1?  Disappointed.   3D is nothing special.  The acting is terrible.  Except for the bad guy.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Cgi was ok but a little too much at times, i wish the script was more compelling but who doesn't like Paul Rudd"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Special effects story line
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. Quite funny. Definitely a set up movie for future movies.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally a recent Marvel film that felt like Marvel. There were a few misses but overall hit the right buttons. Don't listen to the critics. They always score worse than the general public. I really wish Rotten Tomato would show the audience score, not the critic score on the main page."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had a great time watching this film. It was entertaining and plenty in the film was not shown in the trailer, so a couple of little surprises. The Quantum realm was an amazing world filled with interesting characters, while watching I thought this would make a great Star Wars film."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Most of Modok was odd but he is a odd character
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman was fun to watch and hilarious, Kang ranks up there with all other marvel universe villains ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Antman an family saving quatum universe, excellent sequel"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I ever  seen!  You can‚Äôt miss this one!
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A meandering, mindless script whose ""science"" is absurd even for the genre. Five stars for Pfeiffer; half a star for everyone else."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the action and storyline. Very entertaining.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, interesting story, trippy special effects and creatures.  I really enjoyed it."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun and awesome movie.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie unfortunately ain‚Äôt it, marvel really needs to get it together with this latest string of poorly written movies. "
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"great storytelling, amazing plot!"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's eminently watchable.  Just may not get drawn into it as much as the 1st ant-man.. certainly not the worst marvel movie.. better than black widow and eternals at least...
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the movie.. the ideas of beeing Tiny is cool..
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Rating: 7/10. 75/100
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was what I expected. Great plot/story line! I'll definitely watch it again!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme √© bom, vale a pena assistir! 
Kang e Janet se destacam absurdamente, CGI impec√°vel,Quantumania √© lindo!"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed Ant-Man very very much! I thought they did a good job building this very intriguing world and some awesome side characters. 

Jonathan Majors COMMITTED to his role as Kang, and his performance was all-in.  He was a joy to watch, and I cannot wait to see more.  

It was a really fun time, and I'm very excited about things to come."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Even though Quantumania continues on with the awful Marvel exclusive humour that the company has been chugging out since the beginning of Phase 4, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is INCREDIBLY underrated. The visuals are stunning, captivating and grand, which is unusual for Marvel at this point in time. 

I hated MODOK though. The CGI is an absolute disaster. Everything else is great."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Special effects were very good. Story line was on point. Very funny moments
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"changing Scott's character to fit the narrative, plot contrivances and average action. while this movie isn't too bad it has all the flaws of every other marvel movie after endgame, with the same issues with the script, same issues with the fights, and same issues with "" deconstruction. "" AKA character assassination. I wouldn't recommend this movie but its not the worst marvel movie. The only positive is that Kang is a compelling villain and his actor is so on point"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It was such a good movie! So many twists and turns!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie proves that movie critics should not be paid for what they do, this movie is fantastic.

As a long time reader of the comics this was everything i hoped it would be. Kang is brilliant, modok is ridiculous and you really feel the threat of what happens should the heroes fail. Has all the quips and action you'd want from a marvel movie. 

5 stars, more like this please."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great. I like khan as the new ultimate villain. I hope marvel keeps it up.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its a good movie, not great but not as bad as the critics said. I enjoyed it."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it. Good pace. I can see what they say about Kang and his strength level  in comparison to Thanos if he's supposed to be thr next big bang guy but all in all a solid entry. Much better than anything else from Marvel as of late.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This and captain America are the best trilogies of the stand alone avenger films. 
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was alright, not the best marvel movie and not as bad as Eternals"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Very cool movie to carry on Kang
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang is disappointing as the new big bad. Entertaining though
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Ok. Movie was a little silly at certain points and they tried too hard to make characters too unique.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You all need to stop recommending movies. For the money I spent, that was not worth it. I‚Äôm very disappointed."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Yeah glad I did not listen to the critics! Seems like it‚Äôs a bunch of critics that have never! Read a marvel comic! Can‚Äôt wait for the next segment of the multiverse
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a classic Thor adventure but it was Antman. Great special effects and acting was good all around. Jonathan Majors was fantastic.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"We really enjoyed the plot and the acting.   There was more bad language than we liked, but otherwise it was a good movie."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"voy a ser honesto no vale la pena verla en el cine, y ahora mi rese√±a con spoilers, as√≠ que ya saben, vieron una pel√≠cula donde todo le aparece al protagonista para que gane, si o si, bueno esta es una de esas pel√≠culas, no hay drama, efectos especiales muy lindos, no lo niego, pero el libreto por dios, que asco, a ver, primero te presenta a un tipo que tiene tecnolog√≠a siglos lejos de la humana, y no puede desarrollar la tecnolog√≠a de reducci√≥n, tiene todo un ejercito, pero los pueblerinos le gana al su ejercito, y por si fuera poco hasta el ejercito de hormigas super megas desarrolladas, aparece, claro solo en tecnolog√≠a pero f√≠sicamente no evolucionan nada siguen siendo solo hormigas tontas que pelean solo por que se lo dicen, pero bueno, el villano no es nada poderoso o si, no lo se, la verdad que queda medio nulo sus poderes, ahora veamos al aliado del villano, tiene toda la tecnolog√≠a menos un sistema de apoyo para poder apuntar, y por alguna extra√±a raz√≥n que no entiendo, se vuelve bueno al final, kang como villano no sirve, no como lo plantan, y la frutilla del postre, cada ves que puede matar o ser un verdadero villano real, se pone a explicar o hablar, cuando atrapan a ant-man y su hija tranquilamente pod√≠a romperle las piernas a la hija que para que se quede quieta, y ant-man entienda que no sirve no hacerle caso, pero nada, ni un veneno, ni un collar, para que ant-man no lo desobedezca, y al final, cuando volv√≠an a la tierra, para que ataco, se quedaba escondido, ant-man y los dem√°s se iban, y el tomaba tranquilamente el n√∫cleo lo pon√≠a en su nave y listo, es libre."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Movie was horrible, the avenger series has fallen off the rails.  The last Thro movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I cant believe that this one is worse"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Esta es la mejor pel√≠cula de todo mar el pero yo no s√© si hay mal CGI
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was way to confusing for me!!  To much going on all the time.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,I am not a fan of this multiverse stuff.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable addition to the Million Marvel Movies March Along. Fans won't complain, especially the OGs from the 60s, because we're living the dream. 

Phase 4 has been a snooze because the whole phase has been a filler set up for the next big swing, whereas the  prior phases had the odd film playing that role. Worth at least one watch."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While it does deliver some good moments and some decent action. the amazing performance from Jonathan majors isn't enough to save it from its Boring, Anticlimactic story."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Second worst marvel movie I've seen. The CGI was bad and the plot was not the best either. I like what it did for the MCU though and it was so bad it was funny. Multiverse of madness was definitely worse then this though.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,I though it was real boring
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,that's ok for opening phase 5
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,No complaints. This movie is awesome
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lenta y aburrida, demasiado simple."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A movie that fails to end the Ant-man Trilogy in any satisfactory way, and doesn't set up the next mega villain as a menacing force, ùòàùòØùòµ-ùòÆùò¢ùòØ ùò¢ùòØùò• ùòõùò©ùò¶ ùòûùò¢ùò¥ùò±: ùòòùò∂ùò¢ùòµùò∂ùòÆùò¢ùòØùò™ùò¢ begins to shrink when compared to the cinematic classics the MCU used to release."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly wasnt given enough credit. Was a good movie not as good as most movies in the Marvel Franchise but still solid and enjoyable.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,very disappointed.  Too much green screen and out in wherever...way too unbelievable. The innocence and humor is gone. We love antman because we can relate to his issues but now he's way out there in nowhere land.üò≠
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Our whole family loved it.  Idk why people are complaining
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was well written easy on the eyes and much better than I anticipated! The critics don't understand comic book storylines or comic book humor so there will always be a huge disconnect and I don't allow their reviews to impact or influence Marvel movies because they dont get it I mean look at the audience review compared to the critics.  Go see it, its the beginning of  something big in the next chapter of Marvel and there are two secret scenes."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely hate what they did with MODOK. It's embarrassing. But Kang is a beast. This movie is more about Kang and the original Wasp, not Ant-Man and the Wasp. It's better than Thor though..."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was good, not great, but worth seeing.   I really liked it."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"While it's not the best Marvel movie, it is definitely my favorite Ant-Man movie."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just got home from this movie and it was really good, imo. For the majority of the movie, it took itself very seriously, and Kang was an amazing villain. He was extremely menacing and the action/ climax was well done. I really enjoyed it."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are too harsh. Movie was entertaining and didn't try too hard like Thor L&T. Who cares if it isn't as standalone as many would like, watch them all!"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant Man and The Wasp : Worth Seeing?
I think not. I just saw it today. I generally like science fiction/action movies, but this was just too, too much. Silly plot. Too many times you think, ""Wait, I thought that guy was dead"". I usually love CGI, when it's done well. This was 99.9% CGI. It looks like they gave the story to the CGI department and said, ""Here, go crazy. Throw in everything you've got, everything you can imagine, every weird creature you can come up with."""
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was just great I had fun i loved it and i dont know why people hate on it.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,We really enjoyed the movie. Definitely a star wars feel to it.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst Marvel movies in history - the entire story line was led by a stupid teenager's mistake. I cannot believe Disney allowed this.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"What's not to like. It's got action, drama and comedy. Especially love the graphics!"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than what rotten tomato says
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,one of the worst movies I've ever watched. my 16 year old son ageees.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie all together!
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,If you like fairly pointless action in a cgi world with characters you don‚Äôt really care about - this movie is for you.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Overall did not care for.. very Star Wars like and crazy plot lines.. I sure hope Shazam Ii is better. My youngest son really wanted to go with me but even he said, it was ass.."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have never written a movie review before but this movie was a genuine joy to experience. It was an honest sci-fi movie. The cinematography was beautiful and the colors really popped. The story was fun and easy to enjoy. Lots of wholesome family moments that brought a smile to my face. There was not a complicated plot nor were there high stakes that brought anxiety. Hank Pym also had mad scientist vibes that really pay homage to comic book origins. 10/10 would recommend for anyone looking for an easy, fun watch. Really captures what Ant Man should be."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,only good thing was Kong. everything else was eh. marvel needs figure out their issues because lately they are not making good movies. stakes are low in this movie. quantum real looked like a wannabe star wars world . no creativity . disney just copy themselves.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Average marvel movie
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a good fun movie that is very underrated
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Was enjoyable and often very funny!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall, its entertaining and good movie. I understand some have massive expectations from MCU movies, I only see the entertainment value!"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was a little slow to start but was funny and the ending was great.   Helped setup phase 5 a bit more
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not much thrilled after watching the movie left like some children's movies. Waste of time and money!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it. I wanted someone to die or be irrevocably I injured for all that Kang is built up to be, but I thought the movie served it‚Äôs purpose and I enjoyed it."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Grandchildren loved it
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall I liked the movie. It was good, not great."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Wasn‚Äôt that bad‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt wow me but it was definitely entertaining. Definitely the best Ant-Man story in opinion!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the sense of humor of Paul Rudd.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie wasn't good.  The Ant man acts like a child.  They make him look weak.  Special affects was good
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Its all about being entertained, the movie does that."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I love all that is Marvel so don‚Äôt count my opinion lol
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was slightly above average good. The dialogue was good at time but many scenes reminded me of Star Wars taking place in the quantum realm. Kang the Conquerer made the movie better.
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,The M-SHE-U is dead tired.
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Cool sequel to the ant man series! Make sure you wait till after the credits for more!
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Great special effects, but a pretty boring moving.  Wanted to leave, but I was with kids who enjoyed it."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,it was ok i didn't like the movie 
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Meh it could've been better
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Another brilliant Ant-man knockout by Paul Rudd and an incredible kickstart to Kang by Jonathan Majors
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a fun and entertaining movie. The Quantum realm and characters there were really imaginative. Love Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors!
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really liked the movie regardless of what the critics say.  If you liked the previous movies, you will like this one as well.  Also, 2 end credit scenes."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not a great start for Marvel's Phase 5. The only great thing about the movie is Jonathan Majors as Kang. He carries this movie all the way. Im not sure why marvel has this trend now to pump out shows/movie with bad cgi. They sacrifice quality for quantity.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had plenty of cheesy moments, but was still a great beginning of the MCU's fifth phase."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The only thing I'm disappointed by lately around Marvel is this dell predictable iconoclasm from critics desperate to see the studio slip up and fail. Before going to see Quantumania, despite trying to avoid reviews, I was already aware of it having ""second lowest Rotten Tomatoes score for Marvel"" and claims that the cgi was ropey. Ropey CGI? Please show me what the quantumn realm and the creatures that occupy it ought to look like then? These people must have shrunk down and seen sub-microscopic wonders the rest of us can only dream of. MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD...

This was a very enjoyable addition to the ongoing Marvel mega-franchise. It is a superhero movie. It has people with incredible abilities entering into a stange dimension and doing battle with an evil entity. It has some chuckles along the way, and some hokey sentimentality. In other words: it does what Marvel does best and it does it well. I saw another reviewer claiming Marvel had lost their way, because they'd lost the relatable real world of their early movies. Have these people ever spent much time with their head inside the pages of Marvel comics? 

Throughout their history there have always been fantastical, weird, mind-binding, reality-warping adventures with a cast of strangely recognisable and relatable characters.

Paul Rudd's Ant-Man is a great every man for the Avengers. Even here, as the later of his small Ant-Man family he seems somewhat of an underdog outsider - he gets ribbed at family dinner for always going on about that one time he saved the world. 

What this film achieves is the sort of adventure that Fantastic Four films have failed to conjur in their various atempts at adaptation. It's a family team, exploring strange new worlds, and forging deeper bonds with themselves. 

Kang is a compelling, convincing and complicated villain adeptly played by Jonathan Majors. There's nuance here - you feel like, despite his god-sized ego and lust for conquest he still feels regret, hurt, and wants to be liked by those around him, particularly Michele Pfieffer's Janet Van Dyne. Also the look is excellent: comics accurate without being hokey. I loved this take and am excited to see more, and more, and more of him as this phase progresses. 

A special mention must go to MODOK. I couldn't imagine them pulling this character off, but it's done so cleverly. It links well with earlier Ant-Man plots, and is hilarious and tragic in equal measures: I won't say more for risk of spoilers. 

The supporting cast are excellent: Bill Murry's cameo is a delight, Michael Douglas shines as Hank Pym (I see strong  potential for a Hank and Janet prequel some day), Cassie Lang is charming. The only major character I wasn't 100% sold on was Hope: which is probably just down to a lack of dialogue. She's got plenty of action, but gets kind of side-lined in terms of character development, but there's a lot going on in the movie so I'm forgiving.

I think Marvel smashed this one out of the park. I was a bit underwhelmed by Wakanda Forever, I thought Thor God and Thunder was a real letdown. As an opener to Phase 5 this delivers with bells. Make Mine Marvel!"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"We really enjoyed the movie. The premise of it was  believable, being that is a  fantasy. 
We like the action and all the scenery with all the colors and all the different beings. 
It was pretty good, we really liked it. Awesome CGI !!
I think the entire family would enjoy this movie as we did.
I also like the fact that more is to come with that crazy kang character, can't wait to see it!!"
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Mais um filme gen√©rico da Marvel sendo previs√≠vel e sem algo novo. decep√ß√£o
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,liked all the action
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Elements of a good story, just poorly executed. This is square on the writer and director. First MCU movie in phase 4 and now 5 to tease what‚Äôs to come."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I might finally be over the mcu, it was such a stupid movie on so many levels."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Minus some of the cheesier lines with MODOK and Cassie, I actually did enjoy this story and I think it's a good beginning to the Kang ARC of the MCU. It is heavy in CGI, but that was to be expected. Overall Paul Rudd is still charming, Michell Pfieffer is still my favorite, and the overall additions to the cast of Rebellions were intriguing. Really hoping we get to see some of these characters again."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun with lots of good action. Felt a bit too straight forward but doesn't deserve all the hate it's getting for not being the next best perfect piece of cinema.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great afternoon fun!
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"My personal opinion about this movie is that it's great! The humor was there but wasn't forced, the CGI was incredible.  Sure MODOK was a little clunky but overall it was a great movie and a perfect setup for Phase 5 of the MCU.  I think it is being judged a little harshly comparatively to other films but it relates to my favorite quote; ""Perfection; once achieved becomes expected."""
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely not a masterful masterpiece.  But Ant-Man remains consistent with the previous two films.  Paul Rudd and Jonathan Major are the real why you have to watch this movie.  Certain things could have been avoided for the sake of being pleasing to the eye
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie in the MCU
There's nothing that can beat it"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can be snooty about films, but this was made for ludicrous fun. If Roger Ebert were alive, he'd give it a thumbs up."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I wasn't a fan of the Phase 4 (exception: wakanda forever was awesome!!) but I really liked this one! I'm hoping Marvel's going to be Marvel again and not the dumpster fire it has been of late (Shang chi, eternals, she hulk... all aweful!). I have hope again!"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie such a good plot in. I love it.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is ok, but the humor is kind of dumb, and there are a lot of very convenient for protagonist stuffs, however futurist technology animations are really good"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie it made me excited to go back to the theaters. The story had heart. Yes it was unrealistic. But it's marvel MCU
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Alot of fun, great adventure film!  Loved MODOK and the rebels from in the quantum realm."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen the the idiot critics. It should be obvious by now, if it has a low critics score and a CRAZY high audience score, it's gonna be good. The inverse is also true. She hulk ü§Æ anyone? 
This is Easily better than any of the phase 4 movies. I kniw, not hard to do, but it's a fun ride, with good characters and it looks amazing. Go see it. And troll the critics. They are friggin morons."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad is the word, this movie is absoluty the mean."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Colorful, entertaining, with lots of action and good humor.  Some of the plot logic is sometimes shaky but, hey, it's a fantasy movie.  Overall, worth watching."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-man really fell off. Instead of rich world-building of a new dimension, they resort to jokes at every aspect they present of it. It was fun in Guardians of the Galaxy, but not when it's every movie. You can't even say the lack of  setup for the environment was compensated by character development. Every character starts the same as they ended. Huge disappointment of a movie."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good and entertaining. Much better than I thought
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is the weakest of the Ant-Man movies for me, but it is still pretty good. There are genuinely funny moments and an interesting story. People expecting some crazy stuff that affects the whole MCU to happen because Kang is in it might be a little disappointed. But those are are willing to just take the movie for itself will have a fun time."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Ant man film yet!  I enjoyed it
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Look it's an ant man movie so it's a good ant man movie but for the introduction for the part 5 of marvels story it's weak. Good humor and it's a good pass time but I'd wait for it to be released on Disney plus to watch it
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall, I thought the movie was really good.  Acting was great, visuals were stunning. 
 The end left me a little disappointed in that Kang should have easily bested the heroes in the movie.  Don't get me wrong, it is a feel good to have the heroes ""win"" but they would need a lot more firepower to take out Kang....even just one version of him."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this movie.Great to see Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer's roles expanded. Some originality and a movie not too afraid to poke fun at itself. Great acting by Johnathan Majors. It is a sit back and go for the ride type of movie.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed it more then I thought I would, was a fun experience if you don't take it too seriously."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Never a dull moment. Kept my interest throughout the entire 2hr movie. Good action sequences. A must see!
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Reminded me of shark boy and lava girl or spy kids. I'm so sick of the over cgi'd environments. I've been a long time fan of marvel but I think I'm done after this one. Marvel is nothing like the old movies anymore and it's disappointing.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While not as funny as the previous Ant-Man films, I still found it enjoyable. It was a bit on the darker side and more epic than most. And I definitely liked the introduction of  Kang."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. MODOK was perfect
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kang made the movie, the rest was ok. Other than Spiderman No Way Home I have yet to see anything resemble the greatness that was Infinity War and Endgame. Maybe they went too big too early and ran out of steam. Cassie was super cringe and the worst part of the movie."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a great and funny movie! And Michelle Pfeiffer really shown throughout, while Paul Rudd is always fantastic!"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was such a fun movie. Great call backs, especially to the Disney+ shows. The stakes were real, Jonathan Majors killed it as Kang. Seeing Cassie take a center roll was awesome. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it, even going in knowing it was ""panned."""
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Every YouTube movie critic is mad at the MCU these days. ""Too woke"", ""lazy writing"", ""bad CGI"", etc.   Here's a reminder: These are COMIC BOOK movies. They're supposed to be fun, mindless entertainment that offers an escape from the misery of our real lives. Not everything is going to be End Game level, and not everything is going to 100% live up to all expectations. I personally enjoy these movies because they are the live action embodiment of what I loved as a kid. Stop taking it too seriously. Grab a bag of popcorn and enjoy them for the popcorn entertainment they are."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Antvengers: kang darrensty
Not a bad film but the writing suffered. It was just too confusing the whole time and then it ended."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Over hated to the max it's not bad, but it's a great placeholder for Phase 5's journey into the dynasty of Kang.

Overall: 7.1/10"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena pel√≠cula, realiza buenas conexiones y desarrolla muy bien la trama, adem√°s nos regala algo de fanservice que es genial."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It wasn't perfect by any means, but it had all the joy the first two installments had. My little family had fun watching it today."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought this movie would restore my faith in the MCU but I was wrong. I wish they just focused on Antman and Kang rather than trying to focus on like 5 or 6 characters - it felt clunky and poorly executed. Shakey cam action scenes. Lame jokes. Formulaic. Terrible ending. Spoiler alert!! Kang losing to a swarm of ants was a pathetic ending! It was anticlimactic and I'm astounded that they weren't asked to change it in post production.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,In my point of view this movie is the best movie ever of Marvel phase 5 of MCU. The critics of Rotten Tomato seriously ate rotten tomato before watching this movie and giving it rating. Hello critics if you want any mental consultation contact a psychiatrist.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A decent watch. Not bad, but didn't wow. Definitely better than the last Thor film. The marvel movies are all stating to feel a bit samey."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The CGI was not that great especially on MODOK, the story didn't really make sense, Cassie's actor is really weird (should've just kept the helmet on) and the taking off the helmet's in mid battle over and over and over again was really annoying. Take a look at The Mandalorian and Master Chief they are both extremely well at acting and we don't even see their faces plus they top off almost every performance in this movie. Now I did think Jonathan Majors as Kang was gonna be weird at first but after seeing this movie he's a bit better than I expected I don't think he's as good as everyone is saying he is but he did a good job."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Exempt the character of M.O.D.O.K. it is a very good movie
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Love Paul Rudd. It was funny and action packed.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Those giving it a rotten tomato should not be allowed to enter a cinema.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,FANTASTIC! Marvel crushes it again!
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"While I can understand a majority of people don't like doing homework for their movies, this movie delivered on so many things i was hoping for. the humor was more natural than Love & Thunder without indulging on the goofiness too much. only reason im giving this a 4 not a five is because of continuity issues. this was the fuse hitting the dynamite for phase 5. lokking forward to everthing coming."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily the best MCU entry since Endgame.  Free from politics, just a fun sci-fi ride."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Aside from one or two funny jokes and the introduction of Kang, I really feel like Marvel dropped the ball on this. Thanos was an interesting villain because he was so mysterious - they've done Johnathan Majors a disservice by having him be so vividly a part of these movies in what're supposed to be teasers. 

This did not feel like a standalone movie nor a good setup for future films. There was too little exposition, the pacing was too fast, and almost nothing original."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The story is a big mess and it leans too much on CGI
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Took my 8 year old son and he laughed throughout the entire movie. He still brings up several funny scenes till this day.  I thought it was a good entertaining movie overall. Better than other super hero movies. Paul Rudd is always funny to me. Michelle Pfeiffers character was a bit annoying. Found her to be an unnecessary character. I enjoyed the plot of the movie overall.  it was a Fun movie to watch with my son.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best MCU movie of Phase 4!!! It is mindblowingly brilliant! Jonathan Majors as Kang is terrifying. This movie sets up the next Avengers movie very well. The special effects of the Quantum Realm are breath taking. A great film start to finish. Ant-Man, Wasp, Janet, Hank and Hope get trapped in the Quantum realm and meet Kang who has been exiled there and now has an army and wants Scott to give him what he needs to leave. They better be searching everywhere for Avengers- Walmart, Dollar Tree, the couch cushions, local yard sales perhaps? Cause Kang and his deviants are a million times worse than Thanos. Loki season 2 and Avengers: The Kang Dynasty are gonna be MUST WATCH!! The critics who are bashing this movie need to get out of their basements for a breath of fresh air or maybe move their van down by the river to a new spot cause they obviously haven't seen the same movie that 90% of America says is a fantastic film!"
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,I will say it has its problems but I had a great time in theatre with this one. It felt like a phase 2 mcu film leading up to infinity war.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie cannot be called a bad one.In my opinion movie serves all what it promises or what it should.Being an Antman movie it is great.Moreover it set ups the big bad villain Kang greatly.Each scene where there is Kang feels so powerful.Jonathan Majors did a great job.Although only problem I think is that they just ruined MODOK which could have been way better and in some frames CGI wasn't good.Else movie is super entertaining and keeps viewer in...
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Unlike a lot of reviews the movie was graphically Sounds. It never have me the impression not to be in the quantum realm. The story, however slightly thin, was interesting and engaging. With wakanda forever annoying me most of the time, Ant man hardly ever let down. IMDb would score 7,5 (wakanda for me was en 5,5)"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked the movie. however, the CGI was a bit messy, some characters didn't get the time to shine that they should have. I wish it was a bit funnier. and they didn't really show kang that much until the second half of the movie. the acting, especially Pual Rudd and Jonathan majors, was great. I just think marvel is kind losing steam."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Will Marvel ever return to what it used to be? Not like this it won't. Such good actors, such potential in the story, but rest seems just formality, no heart in the exexution. It's becoming harder and harder for Marvel fans to remain loyal like this"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,A Marvel est√° construindo uma nova hist√≥ria e com ess enfio-me mostrou que o que vem por a√≠ vai ser muito bom!
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning in general, and spectacular in 3D! I will see it again in IMAX. Jonathan Majors is a fantastic villain. He stole the film. Corey Stoll makes M.O.D.O.K. oddly believable in a realm that makes to make even Star Wars creature creations look amateur. The family dynamic is pleasant, and I'm so glad Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas have a lot more to do in this go round. Paul Rudd carried his role well and was less doofy and more grounded as Scott like he was in Endgame. The chemistry between her and Evangeline Lilly's Wasp is better than ever. The Ant-Man humor was lessened for the seriousness of starting Phase 5 of the MCU and the critics got it wrong. The newly cast Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang seemed to get the job done and I'm fine with her as the new Cassie/""Stature"" going forward. There were a few pacing issues but that's probably what made me give it 4 our of 5 stars. DON'T LISTEN TO THE CRITICS. LISTEN TO THE MOVIEGOERS!! THIS ISN'T A TRAIN WRECK LIKE BLACK ADAM!!"
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant Man finally has a movie with some high stakes and Scott Lang is as charming as ever. However, awkward CGI and goofy writing result in quantumania failing to capitalize on its momentum and falls flat towards the end."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had a good time watching it as I have with all the MCU movies I have seen (usually seen with a grandchild). In this case, my grandchild wasn't particularly impressed, but normally isn't with movies - he seems to have a very high bar for being enthusiastic about them. For my part, it was a fun film with lots of cool imagery, some good laughs, and a nice ending. I am not sure why it is getting bagged on so much. I was a childhood Marvel reader so I suppose I will like most everything they make - with some exceptions (early Hulk films were just ok, last Fantastic 4 was not so ok)."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great. Hilarious and light hearted for the most part, like Ant-man should be. And a good preview into another side of Kang then we've seen from Loki."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ever since Stan Lee passed on, the writing/ scripts for MCU have been absolutely horrible.  The MCU is done unless they can actually find create a story worth the big screen.  There has been NOTHING creative.  It felt like a bad star wars movie!!!"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie is great, especially Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors. The only thing I didn't like was Modok."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Overhyped and flawed. Lazy plot. Missed potential in character development. Too many bad jokes.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"this film features the villain kang who is certainly the biggest threat to the marvel universe today, he is sadistic and cruel. The film lived up to their expectations and is fun and very captivating to follow the heroes in the quantum realm. However, it's more of a standard marvel movie. In short: if you want a fun and magical movie to pass the time, this is a great choice, the movie is 2 hours long but seems to end in 15 minutes because it is very captivating."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is awesome. Adventure, family, humor ""A perfect blend"". Kang is on fire. Everything about this movie works. It is an extremely fun ride. A must-watch for everyone. I do not know what is wrong with these so-called critics."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I was really amazing movie idk why critics are so less when audiences loved it
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It's fine.  It's a superhero movie.  MODOK special effects looked a bit off.  Why is the media deciding that the bottom is falling out of the MCU?  This movie had a bigger opening than the other Ant Man movies from before the pandemic.  Seems they are doing well to me.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Meh. The imagery was amazing and very well done. Kang commanded the screen but was a little lost on the storyline. Wasn't my favorite.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"entretenida y divertida, s epasa bien el rato, buena pelixula, si vas a ver una pelicula, recomendada"
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was pretty good. I saw it with a group of my friends on Saturday night during its opening weekend and we all liked it 
I give it a 7/10"
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Es hora de comenzar a exigir calidad, es un robo haber pagado una entrada para ver tan mediocre pel√≠cula! No vayan al cine, esp√©renla en streaming"
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Opino que la pel√≠cula es medio buena, no es de lo m√°s importante para Kang Dinasty, no merece ser una pel√≠cula podrida pero tampoco es de lo mejor, la trama a veces el leeeeeenta, Cassie es muy buen personaje y Ant-man medio, pero sin duda lo mejor son las post-cr√©ditos"
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Solid visual and action scene. Kang is an interesting villain. But got a weak storyline and a lack of drama
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than the new Star Wars trilogy
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great, as expected."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie üî•üíØüíØüíØüíØI enjoyed every scene.. Johnathan majors great performance ... Everyone needs to watch this this.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fun, it was trippy, I enjoyed it. I don't know what critics are talking about, it was a billion times better than the eternals for sure. I enjoyed it even more than doctor strange, I wish Doctor strange would have been stranger, but it wasn't. Go see Ant-Man 3 if you like marvel and getting weird."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this movie was great now did it have its flaws yess it did, but the movie is still worth going tooo. Kang is just awesome and soo is the rest of the cast. Cassie is a bit corny in the movie but she is talented enough to get better. Modok cgi could have been better as well. Definnaly way better than what the critics are telling us."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie. Fun and entertaining. Great introduction for Kang (for those that didn't see Loki season 1). Don't pay attention to the ""critics""..."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok... Some funny and entertaining spots.. However didn't quite meet expectations.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"In my opinion, this is a entertaining enough sequel and a little bit better than ant man 2 and right beside Ant Man 1"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in with zero expectations and I really enjoyed this movie. It was a fun ride, especially when viewed in IMAX 3D!"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun trip.  Liked the humor don't know where they're taking the Kang storyline...
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it,  star Wars meets marvel.. I'm in bby. Quantum realm is soo mysterious"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun movie.  Kang of course is great and if you are a big comic nerd, you really will love the end credit scene.   I think with Marvel movies we keep expecting some real big surprises (like Doom or the FF or X-men) showing up or bigger hints and when we don't get them some get disappointed.   This film is worth the ride."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie with a good combination of action and comedy. It helps if you've watched Loki, but it's not required. Of course this movie furthers the storyline of this and future phases, but does so in an entertaining way."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's like two different people wrote the script. The first half was solid. The storyline and setup felt like one was in store for an entertaining Marvel classic w Kang at the center. What we got was a ridiculous children's version full of unnecessary characters and silly creatures. Marvel has lost touch with their core audience. Making good movies seems low on their priority list.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"i absolutely love this movie, i think everyone should watch it and rate it a high score!!"
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Plot is stupid, Over the top special effects make your brain bleed, too long and basically pointless. Phase 5 will be worse than phase 4. MCU died with Iron Man in End Game."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Except Modok CGI face.... everything's good.... specially hyped for mid and post credit scene.... connecting loki season 2 was the ultimate reveal
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantamania was well written and a great addition to MCU. The MCU is so vast now that it's easy to fall into the habit of expecting each movie/installment to top.the mext but that's an unreasonable expectation. The team-up movies are pinnacles because they're team-ups. This movie is better than most that will be put out this year, and it's role in the larger scheme of things will.be pivotal."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was insulting that I had to pay for this Instagram Reels Type movie
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I‚Äôll break up the movie into thirds. First 1/3 good, second 1/3 bad, last 1/3 good.  Movie had a Star Wars feel to it and I‚Äôm not a star was guy.  The movie was ok.   Marvel needs to keep these plots on earth."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movies is really worth watching it's really an awesome movie love it , kang Rules the show 
Paul Rudd scenes are amazing. MUST WATCH"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Holy moly fantastic!

I love the creativity, gags and the emotion connection between characters!"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was excellent. Good story and the visuals were amazing. Best outing for a while after the slightly disappointing thor: love and thunder and black panther: wakanda forever. Felt very true to the other ant-man films although I miss Luis but the relationship between Scott and his daughter felt real and I loved the relationship between all the characters. Great villain as well.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I didn't know much that happened in this movie even though I went twice to see it. I had to close my eyes because of the nonstop CGI, the endless fight scenes and the headache-inducing lights.
To say that Marvel has lost its touch beyond a guaranteed #1 spot at the box-office is not really an understatement. Phase 4 started so well with No Way Home, then fizzled a bit with Doctor Strange 2, disappointed with Love and Thunder. Guardians 3 can't come soon enough. 
If you must see Q, wait to catch it on Disney plus."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors as Kang was amazing he was a serious villain and amazing visuals.
The downside was how he got beaten but nonetheless it was a good movie"
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,1 star for Paul Rudd the GOAT.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While missing some of the charm from the first 2 Ant-men movies, particularly Michael Pena, I enjoyed the movie. Felt like a paint by the numbers Marvel flick."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Love Paul Rudd. Michele Pfeiffer doesnt age. The story line was fun & entertaining.  It was a great family night.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, not great. Marvel fans will like it anyway, I thought it was an enjoyable watch."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn't see it in 3D..
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, didnt expect phase 5 to have such a flat start, the half star you see above, is basically just because of kang, who imo tried his best to carry the story. but still everything else was so boring and flat. not worth a watch in a theater."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely a good mobile. Of course there was more potential but it sets a really good base for the big and amazing phase 5 of the MCU! Really excited
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A boring movie without an interesting plot, they care about giving ""value"" to Kang who is supposedly the new threat of the marvel universe, but the actor is quite mediocre in his performance, the performances are horrible and more like scott lang's daughter than He has no facial expressions, who told him that he knew how to act? well, another simple and boring movie from the Marvel universe"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding!  I was rooting for the villain the whole time.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I came to the theater happily and left left disappointed. Marvel needs to work on their movie's tone and realistic dialogue timing. The saving grace was Kang's wonderful actor Jonathan Majors, but he couldn't sell the movie for me. This movie is only slightly better than Thor 4."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Me parece fatal, una falta de respeto a todos los seguidores de Marvel desde la 1¬∫/2¬∫ fase."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie with excellent characters loved the colour and imagination of the scenery and enjoyed the new characters to boot.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Plot and story poor. CGI good but had no feelings towards the characters
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Was entertaining but not as other marvel movies like Multiverse Of Madness. First time viewer will not understand anything. You have to watch other series and movies to understand.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,SUPERB!!!!!!!  Worth  Money must watch
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good. MODOK was kind of funny but the plot was great after watching all the other Marvel movies. Maybe that plot was similar with Star Wars and the movie gave kind of Star Wars vibes, but still a great movie."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A long elaborate movie of zero stakes suspense set to the cadence of Paul Rudd's safe and warm charm. Expect laughter in the first act, but the silly characters and Humpty Dumpty underboss do not sustain the humor throughout the slow plot. The setting ranges across spacey wilderness with ornate jellyfish, and sci-fi city scapes, all fleshed out with cloak and goggled wastelanders vs. pew pew laser bots. The prestige of the visually complex spectacles wears off as the movie drags on. I recommend breaking it up over the course of three nights before bedtime."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too cute, weird, and predictable."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Ant-Man movie yet
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I feel bad for writing this because I am a big marvel fan but, I think they should take a break. The movies recently ""Antman and the wasp: quantumania, Thor love and thunder, and Doctor strange in the multiverse"" were all disappointments. 
The story was just not right. In this movies case, there was way too much going on, not enough explanation for the story to make a lot of sense. 
The ""comedic breaks"" were very poorly timed and not actually funny just.. very cringy. 
And some parts I couldn't tell if they were being sarcastic on purpose or trying to be sincere‚Ä¶. 
Just not‚Ä¶ worth the watch. 
Also none of it really mattered for the marvel universe, all you really need to watch is the end credit scene."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Antman was a decently wrote script. The visuals were beautiful & the acting is next level. The problem with the story was the plot. It left you feeling like they could have done more. MODOK didn't get the AIM recognition he deserved. He was a bunch of cheesey 1 liners with worse than expected CGI on his face. It will be forever a struggle fitting him into the big screen. As for Kang, he stole Antmans movie. No disrespect to Paul Rudd but Johnathan Majors was the star once he was introduce. From my perspective Michelle Pfeiffer & Bill Murray also were out of place. Both characters needed to die in order to show how powerful Kang really is. However if you've seen the movie you know the ending."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"unfulfilled potential.
This should have been better. While I enjoyed the film, there were too many questionable choices in the production, from effects, to script. Much of the ontentional humor fell flat. The plot relied on deus ex machina too many times. All the performances were above par, particularly the actor who played Kang. They had the opportunity to do something here, and just didn't deliver."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"While this movie may not have the laughs as the previous 2, it makes up in action. This gives the audience the Kang origin story that we deserves. This film shows why Kang is scares Loki"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was easily the best of the Ant-Man Trilogy and a huge film for the MCU as a whole. I cannot wait to see more of what we get between now and Kangs Dynasty. I have a few questions about the decisions with M.O.D.O.K. but this is 9/10 for me all day.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,its was a bit boring in the beginning and in the end it was good
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel just keeps getting worse.   Don't waste your money.  Unless you are taking your small children to see this, it isn't worth it. And, just like every other Marvel Michie as of late, it's predictable and woke, and the acting and punch lines are horrible. I put it up there with Jurassic Park: Dominion"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thoroughly enjoyed. 
The big stand out for me was character design and the world around them."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"A ""casual fan's delight"". If you are a fan of superheroes, of imposing villains, and epic battles reminiscent of the first ""Avengers"" film, this movie is definitely for you. Certainly it can be argued that Marvel has stumbled as of late, but in my opinion, this movie stands as the point where the MCU stopped the fall, took a deep breath, and re-oriented itself correctly (though some minor issues still existed). For starters, the visual effects were stunning, with the Quantum Realm and it's staggering landscapes proving once again why Marvel has got the potential to be better than it's ever been, and the CGI, though still spotty in very limited and short moments, took a massive leap in the correct way forward. Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and Jonathon Majors' Kang are certainly the stars of the show, with the villain ultimately living up to the hype and expectation of any fans looking for a new threat to live for, and in my opinion like even better than Phase 1-3's Thanos (Josh Brolin). Certainly the writing could've used some fine-tuning to take a bit of cliche out of Michelle Pfeiffer's character Janet Pym, and the utilization of The Wasp was lacking in most aspects. It remains to be seen if Marvel can continue to right the ship, but in my eyes, Ant-Man Quantumania is a return to solid ground for Marvel, and the interest continues to build in seeing where they take this new threat to the order of the multiverse."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the graphics, color, characters, plot, action, and some comedy."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel is scraping the bottom of the barrel for recycled story lines and comedic relief. If you're a fan of the typical Marvel recipe of relying on ever more creative special effects to make up for bland, rehashed, plots and jokes that fall flat then go see the movie."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Not horrible but it was alright
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun movie. Rudd is charming. Majors is imposing, M.O.D.O.K is to not to be taken seriously visually, at all. VFX ruined it, not the actor or performance.  good support. This film works because it tells its own stand alone movie. you don't have to be up to date in the MCU to follow and enjoy the adventure. Being up to date makes everything about the movie make a lot more sense and adds to the climax. I enjoyed it. 

Dropping points because MODOK needs the Sonic The Hedgehog treatment."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this film, but can‚Äôt say I did.  I dozed off mid way through.  The whole Multiverse is super confusing.  Marvel please STOP."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great set up movie üçø
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,A Quantum traversing good time.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,It wasn't the worst movie in the MCU. But definitely not anything to rush out to see. Just something to watch to pass the time.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring. Not as funny as other Ant-Man flicks and less interesting than most Marvel movies. Feels like their burnout is starting to show pretty badly.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic film! Great set up for whats to come in the MCU!
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"A wonderful film with the right mix of comity and action. Not as funny as the first two Antman films, but it is still excellent."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and entertaining!
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Exelente experiencia.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was the best Ant Man Super Hero Movie. Very serious more then the others. Critics were way off. This was fresh 
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I was entertained and loved the chemistry of the main characters.  Visuals was awesome and Paul Rudd was great!!!!!
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm surprised that the critics gave this such a low rating. This movie is without a doubt, a little bit weird, but that's what it's supposed to be, and that's what makes it fun. There's a lot going on, but at the end of the day, this is a great setup for Phase 5 of the MCU. Kang the Conqueror is probably the best MCU villain we've been introduced to so far. The plot is a bit slow at times, so that's what keeps me from putting down 5 stars."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie relied on cringe humor and had nothing special to it. A lot of twisted story lines. Jonathon Majors was amazing as the villain and the cgi was pretty good as well.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the movie and story line. Can't wait to see what's next.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I had so much fun with this movie. It was silly and definitely cheesey but in all the best ways.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,enjoyable movie. highly recommend watching
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Graphics are wonderful but theres a huge lack when it comes to the storyline..Its like watching a fight scene without even knowing what really is going on. They should have introduced more about the rest of the characters in the movie...
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It's not bad like the critic's are saying. My opinion is that it was fun and entertaining. My wife and I enjoyed it.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Why is everyone hating on this movie? I thought it was great. My kids did too. I laughed a lot. We came home and watched 1 & 2 again. I'd go back to the theater and see it again. Lots of fun!
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bummer  bummer. and more of a bummer.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a lot of fun.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This was way better than the critics are rating it. I thought this movie was light years better than that garbage blank panther forever movie. That was a true rotten tomato.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,first time ive come out of a marvel movie feeling excited for the future in a long time.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,me gusto la pel√≠cula
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"N√£o √© o melhor filme do homem formiga, mas tem boas atua√ß√µes de Michelle Pffeifer e Johnatan Majors que salval o filme de uma hist√≥ria sem alma."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,They should have done a better job on Modok. He looked liked a tad pole starting to grow his legs.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it but it could've been better, a few scenes felt lackluster but Johnathan Majors and Paul Rudd gave a fantastic performance."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before, the plot is formulaic, and the action is underwhelming, that being said, it passes the time, its not like there is something better showing on movie theaters right now."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,it was very entertaining and funny and thrilling it‚Äôs great to see Paul Rudd back
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fun! Provides a nice tease of the future Avenger threat. Jonathan Majors kills it as a villain. I wish we had more time with him. Absolutely loved MODOK. Yeah, the VFX are starting to feel like they are taking our loyalty for granted, but the issue is clearly with the inhuman deadlines the studio is imposing on the VFX houses. Overall i had a lot of fun and definitely recommend you watch it in theaters. Have fun!"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the better Marvel movies in a while. Paul Rudd & Johnathan Majors were superb. Visually stunning, Action, humor.... Everything you can ask for in a wholesome family movie.  The ""critics"" tore it down, but since when do these idiots know anything... I mean, 1st off get a real job like normal people. 2nd, this ""tomato-meter"" is as worthless as all the other Nazi propaganda out there...  Go see for yourself before u listen to a bunch of witless hacks. Disney prob just sick of ""donating"" to tomatoes ""score-scheme"""
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, silly story.  Skip it!"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This should've been five stars. The movie was great. The 3D incredible. What I didn't like was the movie starting 25 minutes late!
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exciting solid start to MCU Phase 5. Lots of humor while establishing a new ""multiverse"" with the Quantum Realm. Very cool visuals & FX create a new MCU world. Well acted overall but Majors & Pfeiffer steal every scene. Hoping some Quantumania characters continue in MCU, similarly to Thor's movies."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,My friend voted he enjoyed it and rated it 5 starts however I only came for kang and surprisingly Kang and Janet (who looks so damn good) carried this movie besides that did we really ask or want a whole movie in this world that didn‚Äôt introduce the new fantastic four
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Worth watching
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang Dynasty wow can‚Äôt wait, and this Kang villains arc is insane and grounded can‚Äôt wait to see where he shows up again."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics don't know what they're talking about I loved every single moment, and I loved the parts with Johnathan Majors as kang."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly a great movie to see and get a good laugh on. He‚Äôs a hero no doubt, but not the only one. I saw to in 4DX‚Ä¶ extremely recommended!!!"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie had action at consisted pace and all characters matched their roles.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Is it me or did it feel I was at a Star Wars movie. Well it is Disney so why I am surprised. Overall it was a pretty good movie. I love the introduction of Kang the conqueror. Well let‚Äôs see how it goes from here.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Not the most cinematic but a good movie nonethelessless.  Agree with others that I would have preferred more of a backstory on The Kang.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was very good, a lot like Star Wars, too! Kang, the conqueror, a.k.a. the villain was amazing and thrilling, too. Paul Rudd, as Ant-man was also very funny. The whole movie is just great itself for the upcoming avengers movies, and to lead up to the multi-verse of the MCU."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang, Jonathan Majors obviously made this movie, which carries the majority of my star rating. Can't wait to see him in Loki Season 2. Character development was lacking, except for Kang. They needed to work on the dynamic between Scott and his daughter, instead of always yelling for her and protecting her. 
Visuals were great and wished we spent a little more time getting invested in the rebel alliance. Overall I liked it and would watch again."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Good star for the new phase.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I want to give a realistic review.  I'm a huge Marvel fan, but have been disenchanted as of late (for obvious reasons).   I give this movie a C, even though I wanted oh-so-bad to report back that Marvel had finally hit another home run.  It didn't.   However, it does have some good things.  First, there's nothing woke in it at all. That's definitely a welcome relief.  One downside was that the entire movie was in the CGI Quantum world.  I got tired of it.  CGI has its moments, but it can't carry an entire movie.  Everytime there is action, it feels like it's being played on stage with green screens behind you. You begin to feel claustrophobic when watching it.   As for the characters, there were some good and bad things.  I don't like to be mean to kids, but Scott's daughter was not a likeable person.  For some reason, she gave him crappy attitude toward him at the beginning, and it made me just not like her.  Maybe they were trying to make her a sassy teen, but it just made her unlikable. Her acting skills were on par with the young girl in Multiverse of Madness, so you get my drift.   Other actors?  Kang was pretty darn good as the bad guy.  Not great, but good.  I think that he was doing the most he could with a bad script.  If he had a good script, I could really see him flourish.   By the way, why wasn't Michael Pena in this movie?  Leaving him out would be like leaving Rocket out of Guardians of the Galaxy.  How could you leave him out?  They also left the Chinese Cop out, other than him (quite literally) having a 2-second cameo at the very beginning.  Really like what he brought to the first two Antman movies.  Not sure why he was left out.  Michelle Pfeiffer was solid.  Scott Lang was good, as always.  Ultimately, however, the CGI world was tiring and the script just really wasn't that good.  Compared to the lame stuff Marvel has put out recently, it was a step in the right direction.  However, Marvel needs much better script writing."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Almost nothing in the quantum realm is interesting. Cassie isn't very interesting because they made her a hero so fast. Although kang the conqueror is what makes the movie better. Also it's connecting the mcu a little bit more. The visuals for the quantum realm is cool though. Modok is terrible but it makes sense that he might have going to be bad because he's a head. Ants in the movie are awesome. It's an interesting story that could have been done better. Overall it's still worth to watch if your an mcu fan and has good qualities but loses a lot of the quality.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Some of the dialogue was very good with many quips and, of course, the special effects were great.  It was a good Marvel movie but not outstanding."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,It didnt meet my marvel expectations. Kind of Star Wars ish. Plot and villain were excellent. Fight scenes still great.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Story was weak, but the new villain of the mcu Kang saved it and was the redeeming factor"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a very good movie. Maybe not a cinematic masterpiece, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what it was meant to be. I wish there was more kang and less Darren- MODOK is a cool villain but the vfx on him was a little in the uncanny valley. Overall worth a watch."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun take - the MCU is now venturing into the complex, fun, and messy realm straight out of the comics. It takes a bold and fun approach to scale the intricacies of the comic pages to screen and does a fantastic job in making it happen setting up great storylines to come."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Weird and ridiculous. Visually pretty
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel insist in not deliver good pieces.
Poor history terrible visual effects and no connections woth the MCU.
Kang (Majors) is like water in the desert and make miracles bit wasn't enough to save the move. If you didn't watch wait until become available on streaming. Save your money!"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"After a somewhat disappointing Phase IV, I'll think Quantumania has the MCU back on track.

It was entertaining and satisfying. I don't know why the critics couldn't appreciate it."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"A little quirky, a little cheesy, and really entertaining.  Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer were absolutely AWESOME. Majors' Kang is definitely the next big thing in the MCU, and Pfeiffer's Janet was the dramatic that moved the story forward in a more serious manner. Honestly, Majors and Pfeiffer could have done the entire movie themselves and it would've been darker, more serious, and probably even more interesting, but as it was it is entirely enjoyable, go see it!"
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall, it was fine - entertaining enough and is essential watching for the MCU. However, none of the actors were particularly notable except Jonathan Majors as Kang of course - which was overhyped in my opinion (he was good but not great). The quantum realm and the storyline has too many artificial qualities to it - several deux et machina it seems, a MacGuffin, and world building that is too in love with itself (kind of like Taika Waititi in Thor Love and Thunder). But if you just go to have a good time, it's a fine experience at the movies."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The various scenes in the quantum realm, Kang, himself, and Janet. I would say more, but I dont want to ruin anything for anyone who hasnt seen it yet."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie was okay. Nothing special. Couldve been better but couldve been worse :/
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don't understand all the terrible reviews. The movie was entertaining - good, not great.

Go in with soda, popcorn, and low expectations, and you'll have a good time."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was bad‚Ä¶it was really bad!
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While I loved Jonathan Majors portral of this particular variant of Kang The Conqueror, I hate to admit that the plot logic used in this iteration of Ant-Man was lacking.   For starters, given that Kang comes from the future - he should have been more than capable of retreiving the multiversal power core on his own.  With the future tech that he had at his disposal, it did not make sense that he would need anyone, let alone Scott Lang to obtain it for him.  Just seemed like a poor reason to make Ant-Man's character useful in that instance.  Also, if it took three - not one or two, but THREE variants of Kang (supposedly powerful versions of Kang from the comics - Immortus, Rama-Tut, and the Scarlet Centurion) to banish Kang to the Quantum realm, how was it possible to defeat Kang with Ant-Man and friends (his family, rebels and evolved ants included)?  I just cannot swallow that pill, sorry Marvel.  Again just seemed like another lackluster reason to include Kang in an Ant-Man movie.  Lastly, I do not understand why Janet was so tight lipped with regards to what she went through while in the Quantum realm.  If she knew that there was such an enormous threat still present there, that should have been one of the first things to impart upon her family.  But no, she just stands there idly while her family (Scott excluded) creates a device that can establish contact with the Quantum realm.  She should have gone mad and immiediately destroyed the device on-site.  But again, another poor reason to have Kang in this movie.  Lastly M.O.D.O.K. should have been utterly ruthless, with little to no shred of humanity left.  Him turning sides and betraying Kang at the end was meh.  The one thing I loved about the movie was how Kang was handled with regard to his presence.  He did not have any wasted movements.  Plus you could see the rage slowly seething within his being until he just unleashes it at the end.  That plus the two extra scenes at the end of the movie.  They were very fitting.  One was straight from Avengers 292, while the other was a tie-in to Loki season 2.  While I did like the movie, I think that the above issues I have with the movie really weakened the plot in my opinion."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Really fun though a bit too much focus on Cassie.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dear Critics and anyone else who didn't like this movie,
Deal with it.
The movie has a great intro, good plot, great fight, and a decent ending.
What in the hell else do you want. If it was a dark , gruesome, extremely violent with nudity it would be 5 stars.
Why in the world are people so judgemental on things that they do fit into their world. Please be open minded"
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was decently funny made me think of guardians of the galaxy with the characters in it but it‚Äôs not worth going to see in 3D save a lil money and just go to the 2D
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very fun without feeling forced or out of place like with Thor L&T. Best marvel film in a while.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun romp with Antman and the wasp.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I just saw quantumania, it was a B+ marvel film. But I feel the critics are attacking it because many are tired of the comic book movies and people don't get the concept of Kang. The majority of the audience looks at time from a linear perspective and not in elliptical perspective of kang. Why did the council of Kangs send kang to the quantum realm? Because maybe a Kang had to be sent to the quantum realm in order for to contact the other kangs through a probability storm to occur like Scott. Those kangs shared information and technology in order to began kang's conquest from that point. The quantum realm Kang knew he started the war, but couldn't know how it exactly happened because the quantum realm exist outside of time. So Ant-man created Kang in the same manner 90's batman created Joker in the movies. But that's my take on the movie from reading so many comics with Kang the conqueror, to me that's what makes him so dangerous"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing. It is the perfect start to phase 5 and I hope we get to see more movies like this one
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Kang actor was outstanding.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You know what made previous Ant-Man movies great? The humor and the odd combination of friends that add to the adventure (Ana Akana, Ti, Michael Pena, etc). Eliminate the humor, the friends, and you're left with Ant-Man 3. Although Jonathan Majors (Kang) does a good job, the rest of the movie is lacking. I wouldn't spend money on this one in theatres, just wait for Disney plus release. Bring back old school marvel and their writers. Whatever has changed in Disney is not working!"
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was not very great. The way he said we both have to lose and then he won with no consequences makes me mad. It gets a 3/5 because Kang is such a great villain
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as the first Antman movie because it misses a lot of the original charm. No where near as bad as people say it is. It's a fine Marvel movie. I don't understand the praise for Jonathan Majors' performance because he didn't really do much this film, but I will watch more of him as Kang before fully forming my opinion."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think overall it's a good movie however the ending didn't quite sit right with me given how powerful Kang is. Some of the comedy didn't really land and was a bit forced. Jonathan Majors is a goddamn actor. He fits the role of Kang. If it wasn't for him, I'm not sure how good this movie would be."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the Marvel franchise movies so Im a bit bias. I love the story line and the graphics. Everything h about this movie was on point. Will watch again when on Disney plus.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Cool way to introduce Kang! Very sci-fi feel to the movie.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie! Was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I absolutely loved the D-Box seats. It made watching a movie more than just that- it was a whole experience!"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Disappointed.  Just some stupid scenes, far-fetched and ridiculous. I'm a big Marvel fan, especially of Paul Rudd, but this movie just didn't do it for me.  My 17-year-old gave it a 5 out of 10."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Majors is excellent in his role as Kang!!!!
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was visually overwhelming, but the story was good."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I AM M.O.D.O.K
DEREK IS THE ULTIMATE AVENGER !!!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining till the very end!
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst script I'd ever seen
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked this movie. The ants were honestly the best. So many funny moments. Best advice for the haters‚Ä¶ just don't be a dick.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics appear to be out of touch with what audiences like. This was an enjoyable and entertaining film to watch.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Another piece to the jig saw puzzle to marvel.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"One of my least favorite Marvel movies. It was silly, there gigantic plot holes, I tried to tamp down my expectations, but was still disappointed.  All that being said it wasn't awful and I am glad I saw it"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,la peor pel√≠cula de mci
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Major as Kang is menace.
Probably the best Ant-Man movie 
VFX/CGI off in several scenes which was very disturbing to notice and the chemistry between Scott and Cassie was off, Kathrine has failed to show her acting skills which was a bit disappointing other than that it's a fun/time pass movie , which you can watch if you're into MCU if not then it is not you man üòá
Thanks for reading this far. üëç"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania had a great blend of comedy, drama, and action. Many aspects of the movie show lots of creativity with everything surrounding the Quantum Realm. Bill Murray was a fun small addition to the already great cast, especially Paul Rudd who is likable and funny as always. Another fantastic addition that definitely stands out is Jonathan Majors in the much larger role as the villain Kang. The movie is not perfect, but it's a good enjoyable movie and in my opinion, better than many recent MCU film additions as well as most of the shows."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mais uma bizarrice clich√™, da f√≥rmula batida da marvel"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Marvel once again puts out an epic movie.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was cool for what it was
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun action movie that does a good job of setting up Loki Season 2
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots and of action. Really enjoyed it
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was very good. I enjoyed every minute of it. It was funny, it had a lot of action, and it was a great start to phase 5."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the set design, and all of the work that went in to make the characters  animation. I think this was very well done"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A son between Marvel and Star Wars
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A true comic book superhero movie and fantastic Ant-Man trilogy cap to kick-off the MCU phase 5! I loved how the Lang/Pym family got the chance to shine in a big stakes story that tapped into their true potential. Scott and Cassie's arcs were great and Kang was a homerun, as well Hank and Janet each having solid parts. The special effects were mind blowing and the sense of adventure and fun permeated the film up to the very end. This is a must-see for the MCU future and a preview of the awesome multi-verse saga to come!"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Save your brain cells and your money.  Disney continues its destruction of Marvel.  Paul Rudd is a secondary character in his own movie.  Evangeline Lily is almost a tertiary character in a movie with her Wasp name in the title.  Michael Douglas walks around dazed and confused almost like he's wondering what happened to his career.  The guy that played Kang was actually very good, but it gets lost in the steaming pile of a plot.  Modok is completely ruined.  Michelle Pfiefer's character makes no sense whatsoever.  The Cassie character is ridiculously dumb.  Humanoids in the Quantum realm are stupid.   There's no Luis and Kurt in this movie.  There's all this foreshadowing of how horrible it is to go into the quantum realm, yet in previous movies they all went there multiple times.   Somehow the growing and shrinking suits and discs work proportionally within the quantum realm.  It's all so preposterous."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually very eye catching. Rough millennial lines at the beginning of the movie, but they get more tolerable towards as it goes on. Pretty cool aliens and cities shown. A good time."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lacking a really good point and the film we way too busy. Kinda hits woke movement and that's not necessarily what I want to pay and. Just make a great movie. 
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Marvel‚Äôs incessant need for bad jokes
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the hate for this movie, it was GOOD !"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't get the negative criticism reviews. The MCU has been on a lull since Endgame and Spiderman but this is a return to form for me. Finally feels like they're building to something bigger and its just a good quality funny action movie with some fun characters and set pieces. It's not an all time classic or anything but it's a fun time and the best film since No Way Home for me. Just hope Guardians 3 keeps the momentum going as have been looking forward to that for what seems like forever.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible. It's a kids movie. If you didn't like Thor: Love and Thunder, you won't like this."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Overuse of the Quantum realm made this visually and physiologically overwhelming. In a land where literally anything can happen, there are no true stakes. The dues ex machina relies on 2000 year old ants that ‚Äúsomehow‚Äù got separated from the Pim family upon re-entry of the Quantum realm. I hate where Marvel is headed after 15 years of great plot and character builds."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"An amazing movie, well done, well executed, and much better than wakanda forever."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie has a great villain and a good cast, but the writing leave much to be desired."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's just another post end game M-She-U Marvel junk
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's not so good. The actors are very well, but the plot is very bad. Marvel can to do something better."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's true that I didn't enjoy it as much as the first Antman outing. But it's solid superhero fare, and Kang is amazing.
As to the complaints about the cgi - Sweet baby Jesus, those posters must have just HATED Avatar."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel is just milking the cash cow at this point, to much GCI and 0 plot"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman Quantumania was really great! 
I'd probably give it a 9/10 Upper Echelon of Marvel but not the best of the best. 
Super beautiful and creative. The CGI was great, the worldbuilding and characters looked like something outa StarWars.
The plot did a great job of setting up Kang.
Also it was pretty hilarious, I was laughing through most of it! 
Thoroughly enjoyed :D"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I wouldn't classify this as an Antman movie. 
really, it's like an introduction of Kang the conqueror.  I would watch it again."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As it's own movie, it lacks a bit, as an installment of the MCU, it's fantastic.
It's hard to talk about what's missing without giving away spoilers, but there are characters, and elements from the first two films that are missing from this one, and I think it hurts the enjoyment of this movie overall. Until Avengers: Endgame, Ant-Man had been a relatively low-stakes character, so on one hand it does make sense that he would be put into a position to save the multiverse, on the other hand, the fun ""heist movie"" aspects are really missing here.

The first two films didn't require the audience to know anything about the MCU going in, but you might be confused going into it if you haven't seen at least: Ant-Man, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and Loki Season 1, which is a lot to ask of audiences for a film that doesn't have the word ""Avengers"" in the title.

If you've seen all of the ""requirements"", Kang is the real star here. He is intriguing, terrifying, and at times charming. As soon as he enters the movie, it becomes a lot more fun. If you're already a fan of the MCU, you'll probably enjoy this movie, but if you've only seen bits and pieces of it, you might want to skip this one."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was ok, weakest of the AntMan series.  The original cast was great with what they had to work with. Kathryn Newton though was the weakest link. I did not care for her performance (unless a whiny teenager was her goal). 
On the other side Jonathan Majors  was great as Kang The Conqueror. I can honestly say this movie suffered from too much cgi. Half way through the movie I started losing interest in it. It was like Star Wars meets the Guardians of the Galaxy. I'm a big Marvel and DC fan, but this movie is slightly above The Eternals."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A return to the fun of the earlier Marvel movies. The visuals are stunning and almost bring an AVATAR or STAR WARS feel to the Quantum Realm. 
Unlike most of these jaded critics, I think that all of the primary cast members did a great job and contributed to the story and the plot. 
Props to Jonathan Majors as a convincing and thrilling villain in Kang. It's a great popcorn movie that starts off a little slow but really brings its game to a thrilling and nail biting climax.
I am baffled by the wide margin of approval for this movie from the professional critics and the movie going audience who seems to love it."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great but was not happy with the end. 
I found there was missing at least 45 min of details. Too short.... The 2 clip at the end was very great though."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the funny quips Paul Rudd did.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing movie.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it -- missed some of the other Ant-Man characters. The quantum realm can be anything, so I thought this take on it was great. Seeing our very first (cinematic) Kang varient was awesome -- can't wait for more to come!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"What I enjoyed about this movie is the fact that it's building up to a more big bad out of this world threat. The story and visuals are good but it is a new start (Phase 5) but also explores the multiverse of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Spiderman No Way Home, Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness) it is a must see for fans of comics and the MCU that how these films are world/universe building one movie and show (Disney Plus) at a time."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a great film, and the right step in the direction for new Marvel movies. This is definitely the strongest Ant-Man movie of the trilogy, and it shines through well. A good translation of a character that's a far more grounded hero in the predecessor films, and taking him into another world of sci-fi. A strong villain, and not a moment in the movie where you were bored. The stakes were fair, the future is promising, and the end was fulfilling."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you go into this movie expecting it to all be neatly wrapped up at the end, like Endgame, you will be disappointed. If you see it for what it is, the introduction of the next MCU big villain for the next 2-3 years, then you will love it. 
  At the end of the movie Scott is left feeling so much fear, anxiety, and doubt about the outcome of the fight with Kang. The mid and post credit scenes shows you that Scott was right to feel that way!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It‚Äôs an entertaining superhero movie and there are good special effects and CGI.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall I enjoyed this Marvel film. Of course definitely not it's best, there were some cheesy parts (I'm assuming meant to add humor) that could've been done without. But the CGI was beautiful and the action was great. Well done movie. Not a huge fan of Ant Man however this was his most enjoyable film of the three!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,pretty fuckin great. kang good. ant fine
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was highly interested, in anticipation, to see how marvel would introduce us to the world of the Quantum Realm. As soon as the movie entered the never before seen world I was immediately distraught about the further quality of the picture. When I say ‚ÄúShark Boy and Lava Girl‚Äù had better CGI and fictional characters for their ‚ÄúPlanet Drool‚Äù , I mean Ant-Man and The Wasp would‚Äôve had a lot more problems to deal with than Kang. This movie could‚Äôve been on Disney + . This was a lazy execution for the Quantum Realm and marvel viewers deserve better."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Why does the Marvel Universe feel like it's over?
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the movie, the cgi, scenery, action, everything was great, but only a few dialogues made me disconnect a little from the movie, but overall it was very good"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not for the viewer who dislikes sci fi
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It seems that most critics who have seen this film are suffering from the same problems as Darren Cross; ""Why am I such a dick?"". Luckily like Darren, they too can be redeemed upon a second viewing of the third entry to the Ant-Man series. Director Peyton Reed shows his comfortability with the character in a beautiful spectacle of stunning visuals that bring the quantum realm to life. Both Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors steal almost every scene they are in, proving that Kang truly is the new big bad of the MCU. Katheryn Newton is a welcome addition to the Ant-Man family, supported by the refreshingly comedic Michael Douglas. Coming off the tonally deaf Thor Love & Thunder, and the chaotic mess that was Doctor Strange & The Multiverse of Madness, Quantumania is an engaging recalibration for the MCU."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just another subpar meaningless marvel movie,watch loki and you'll miss nothing and it's cheaper."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Part Star War, part Godzilla, part Alice in Wonderland. A great ejaculation joke that ends up being super important to the story line. A big dumb floating head. That guy from the Good Place. This is top ten MCU content."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun movie, and I never felt bored or wishing that it was more than it is."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"To start off,the visuals were amazing! Phenomenal cgi and vfx effects. The villain was okay to me, threatening most of the part. My only issue is that the plot felt somehow lackluster or average/basic if you can call it that. Either way still a good movie"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was good. I wouldn‚Äôt say it was the best Ant-Man movie. This movie felt too big budget for Ant Man for me. It didn‚Äôt have as much humor as the other ones did. I still liked it. It was a good marvel movie not a great Ant Man movie. 
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Funny and made me wonder what was going to happen next.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Totally enjoyed this installment of Antman,  for me I look for storylines,  and overall entertainment.  I was engaged from beginning to end the action in this one kept me looking for what's next!! Love the marvel universe looking forward to next one!!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great! A perfect introduction to phase 5.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,As someone who's a major fan of Marvel Comics and very intrigued on how they would be introducing Kang (as he is almost impossible to keep track of in Comics) they far exceeded my expectations! Major's has done an incredible job on bringing  these variations of kang to life. They did a great job of bringing the perfect amount of comedic approach we all love about Antman while still striking fear about Kang the conquerer unleashed.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid Entry overall an entertaining experience. A pleasant ""quantum avengers film"".

A single issue with a character but I think that's been voiced. 

It is a departure from the first two films much less a sequel to Ant-man and much more of a sequel to Endgame."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"La pel√≠cula me gust√≥ mucho, tanto en las interpretaciones como en los efectos visuales, pues la vi en 3D. La pase muy bien sobre todo al final con el enfrentamiento  entre Kang y Scott, creo que Jonathan Majors se perfila a ser no solo un buen actor si no a ser un villano a la alt√∫ra de esta nueva fase."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the concept of both the multiverse and the quantum-verse is quite a buffet to serve to an audience who has been a bit drained by the whole superhero genre. I love all things comic book so I found the movie to be visually exciting and while the story line felt thin, I stayed engaged. Jonathan Majors performance was nothing short of captivating, and Paul Rudd played well off his energy.  Quantumania is a movie that will be appreciated later for the bridge it provided to a more vast story telling universe."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite criticism of the often distinctly alien CGI environments and ""poor performances"" by the leads, I found Quantumania to fulfill its purpise beautifully: set up Kang the Conqueror's role in the multiverse and provide closure to the original Ant Man arc. It achieved both in a fun, incisive and fresh approach to the MCU led by an entrancing performance by the incomparable Jonathan Majors. He is the best star the MCU has ever had. This movie hews closer to the experimental, varied Disney+ projects like WandaVision and Loki, a welcome and cinematic approach to the genre of Superhero films that are losing their luster in the eyes of the critical media. I welcome this new chapter of Marvel's work and hope the critical vocal minority is silenced by widespread fandom as people grow to understand the multiverse and Kang as a villain."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie officially ended the MCU for me. Won't pay my own money to watch another of these movies.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fell asleep for 10 minutes or so in that lull about two-thirds through. 
Visually stunning and a creative concept. Great villain and sets the stage for even more Marvel movies. Otherwise, it felt very much like an even goofier version of Guardians of the Galaxy. The giant head man was a bit ridiculous. 
The early part of the film is a bit hard to follow if you haven't kept track of the details in Ant Man's storyline."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good. Shows KANG well.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great family movie, lots of weird characters, and Kang is awesome."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is fun and exciting. Is it a great Ant-man movie, no. But is it a great movie to set up the next movies and shows, yes. A fun adventure that I just needed a little bit more heart."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'll keep it short: It's probably one of the best and most fun of the Marvel films. Some of the negative reviews I have read have baffled me by referencing objectively wrong (non-opinion) things that were not even in the film. If you liked either of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies you will love this, and the villain is fantastic."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was very good. Paul Rudd was great as always, as was the rest of cast. Jonathan Majors is fantastic as Kang. My only issues were with the end. I felt like the closing monologue by Scott was added after a screening because it seemed to happy an ending. Also, the ants were a little too convenient at the 11th hour. But, I still very much enjoyed the movie."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Different from previous films. Less comedy, more big spectacle. Some characters are wasted while Kang steals the show. IMAX 3D made it pop. "
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me encanto buena historia dan una explicaci√≥n al villano en ese universo, solo mordo fatal, pero volver  a verla üòâ"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie so i pleasantly surprised how much i enjoyed it! i found myself sympathetic toward the villain, loving the family dynamic, and the visual affects rival the Avatar movies. I really enjoyed this movie! Can't wait to see it again!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly it was what multiverse of madness should have been. Quirky, funny and visually stunning. One of the better post endgame movies. Don't listen to the critics and go see it if interested."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lo mejor que han hecho de star wars ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠, no ya en serio es una peli muy olvidable..."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was fun and met all expectations for a Marvel movie. It was action packed, funny, tied up loose ends from previous movies, and set the scene for movies going forward."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great adaptation for modok and i think it had another great end credit scene that sets up future mcu movies.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great and fun movie. As an antman's third movie manages to be both visually and emotionally compelling. 

Kang and MODOK do a good contrast of what the nature of Marvel villains can be, heinous and hilarious. 

So sad to see they changed the actress for Cassie tho."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,over all it is a awesome experience to see kang in such a big scale . post credit scene was dope. much better than phase 4 movies .
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is awesome man
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really don't get the hate behind this one. It's definitely not as bad as the critics say, on the contrary, it's a great movie, I had a lot of fun with it, it's enjoyable, funny and serious. Only thing if anything, i don't know how I feel about Kang. Like, I absolutely loved Thanos but Kang is weird, he isn't necessarily menacing, plus his CGI is tacky, but we'll have to wait to see, what's cooking. I also didn't like Cassie's character, she was annoying."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Compared to the last few marvel movies I didn't have high hopes for this 
But my god this is something special - great visuals and a solid adventure story it plugs the gaps of the mystery behind Janet and introduced the next big bad villain
Highly recommend"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly have no idea what the critics didn't like about his movie.  It was fun, funny and had great action and acting."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Just more MCU scene setting with an overuse of CGI. Really preferred the first two Ant-Man films which were a bit more grounded.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is a solid outing for the Ant-Man franchise, led by a capable cast with an overambitious VFX approach. It packs in non-stop action and carries forward the broader MCU storyline setting the stage for the Phase 5 Avengers movie. While it makes sense that this is a ""fantastical"" quanta-universe, it feels like a movie set inside of a synthetic version of the legendary Star Wars Cantina."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Some really great moments by Paul Rudd, but the story line felt forced and far-fetched. There were also tie-ins to shows on Disney plus that I haven‚Äôt watched, so I had to have these moments explained to me."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I want to address the hack critics first. They have come to expect a formula, and god forbid any movie or franchise get them riled up. You have to think of the MCU as a comic book. Just like the source material, things will happen and you'll have to go to another character's story to put the pieces together. It's fun for us REAL die hard comic fans. It's what has been and still is done in the comic industry, and what is being done here. There are Links to WandaVision, Dr Strange, Ms Marvel, Spider-man, Loki, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, and Avengers in the movie Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, you just have to do it if you want to enjoy it. 

It's a great movie! Probably my favorite Ant-Man storyline by far. All of the actors delivered, (Still kinda annoyed they replaced Cassie, but it is what it is I guess), and the dialogue was fitting to this character's universe. There were a few characters there just to speed the story along (ie: William Jackson Harper, Bill Murray) with no other purpose but exposition, which was annoying, but it was still an enjoyable watch. Far better film then what the critics are giving it, but yes, as I mentioned, to ""get"" somethings, you'll have to watch some of the previous films and Disney+ content. If you have not, then you'll feel lost."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie really infallible üî•üî•üî•. You must watch it. Don't be bad 'bout this movie, you'll love it ‚ô°"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it and would absolutely see it again. It was a very fun movie with some good humor in it too. Opened up the Kang dynasty. 
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun movie and my family enjoyed it!
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Brings past movies/shows together and gets you ready for what is coming. Critics are being stupid with their take about the visual effects (it is the quantum realm not earth). Also they don't push stupid political stuff and other things kids don't need to see. A true marvel comic book movie.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,A real let down. The MCU feels like it's on its last leg
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Parenting father - daughter relationship and its complications shown perfectly.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not the most amazing movie in the MCU franchise, but it seems like critics are just tired of the MCU. This is an entertaining movie and the humor hits much better than Love & Thunder. Majors is amazing as Kang. You like the MCU, ignore the critics on this one and go see it."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally great Marvel movie. Not the best of them, but really good."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Cgi incr√≠vel mas a forma que o Kang perdeu √© rid√≠cula , tendo em vista que ele matou v√°rios vingadores . A n√£o ser que esses vingadores fossem uma vers√£o fraca e sem poderes ."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good to see an Avenger back in the theaters.  The movie had a good story line but a little too much CGI.  It seemed it was going the Avatar route. I guess being in the Quantum Realm what could you do but CGI.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie up the way 3 or 4 D movies are made especially with the seats moving. Im from the 50s and 3D movies definitely have changed. It was my 10yr old grandson first time seeing a 4D movie. I wished I could had caught his expressions on my iPhone. It was hilarious to watch him. I enjoyed the movie very much.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome engaging storyline!
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Thought it was great!! Don't trust critics!!!
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Quantumania should have been the first movie of The Multiverse Saga after Spider-Man: Far From Home. The sentimentality was always present while the storyline and action kept me in ‚Äúant-icipation‚Äù for the next moment. The movie was well done and Jonathan Majors has transcended as an actor into an action star!
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Reviews of this movie were mostly negative, so I expected little going in. Recent Phase 4 movies have been very disappointing too - I found Black Panther 2 slow mawkish and underwhelming, and Thor Love and Thunder was tepidly humorous at best. So I was actually pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable this movie was - as all the Ant-Mans have been - if not exactly 'greats'. It's a very different animal from the previous though...

The most watchable series of Phase 4 has undoubtedly been Loki - and this movie draws a direct thread from Loki in so far as it introduces the next big baddie, Kang. Kang, played by the excellent Jonathan Majors,  powerful presence in every scene, if not yet quite on Thanos-level. Yet. Marvel does a great job of making its better baddies relatable and nuanced - and this is one of those. As a curtain-opener on how formidable Kang can be - this movie serves its purpose well. The plot revolves around his attempt to escape the Quantum realm, and the heroes' attempts to stop it.

I think going into this movie expecting an 'Ant-Man' comedy/heist is problematic and might explain the poorer ratings (along with the dubious association of its poorer siblings). Though it has been compared to Journey to the Centre of the Earth, it's more akin to Star Wars with a quantum-sized dollop of Disney's The Black Hole. Certainly, the landscapes and creatures and beings are fantastically creative, whether or not they are to your taste. Evil Empire? Check! Faceless goons? Check! Creepy floating legless robot killing machine... er, check. Sort of.

The cast is fantastic and really makes this movie tick despite all the CGI and VFX. I was particularly pleased at the central role of the wonderful Michelle Pfeiffer. There were no weak links, though Hope Van Dyne has less to do here really, as Cassie Lang is Scott's true second in this movie. I also enjoyed Bill Murray's surprising and unusually off-tone cameo. My wife kept noting that Hope looks the same age as her mum Janet - a testament to Pfeiffer's ageless magic. But she's shallow like that (my wife, not Michelle Pfeiffer). To be fair, Michael Douglas has aged well too, and Rudd, conversely, is just starting to lose his youthful looks. There. Now everyone has been judged. No sexism here. Do we care about this? Really?

There is nothing wildly ground-breaking in this movie. We've sort of seen it all before. But it works. It is VERY CGI heavy, and not everyone likes that (again, the critics clearly didn't) - so be warned! The whole movie was in front of a green screen it seems, and I do wish there had been a bit more of an attempt to do practical effects a la the Star Wars, but given how zany much of this is - it might well have been impossible. This was far more watchable than Wakanda Forever (currently an bloated 84% critic reviews on RT!) or Thor Love and Thunder (a still somewhat overrated 64%), so Quantumania's 43% critics' is way off the mark (and the audience score of 84% perhaps reflects this). I would put it somewhere in the mid 70s as a good time to be had if you don't expect too much, with some standout performances, a decent baddie (essential!) and some of the best pure sci-fi action we've seen in the MCU since Endgame."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is clearly evident that Rotton Tomatoes is full of Karen's who probably were never belt whipped as children. An audience score of 84% and RT of 48%. You could show them a stick laying on the ground and they'd rate it 90% but an action picked Marvel movie, nope 48%. Go sip your Starbucks you hippie loving swine."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went into this movie excited for another Ant-Man movie and excited to continue the journey where we left off last time as with all Marvel movies.  I thought the movie did not disappoint.  Without giving anything away, this 3rd installment had me laughing out loud, had me surprised at times as well as holding onto the edge of my seat.  I'll admit, it's hard for me to not like a movie starring Paul Rudd....this guy just makes me feel good about life in general. :)  Also, the entire theater clapped at the end...to me, that means the movie is a success!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exactly what you would expect from a fun, bombastic superhero movie.  Great pacing, fun plot, and iconic villain."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-man and the Wasp quantummania is a fun, action packed funny entry to the Ant-Man franchise. This movie had an amazing new villain that we hoped to see evolve in the MCU and some incredible visuals on the likes of Doctor Strange. This movie gets slow to feed the audience with information about Kang, Janet and the multi-verse but picks back up in the 3rd act."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was awesome, I was worried cause of the Rotten tomatoes score but I don't understand why it was rated so low. My friends and I loved it."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is not as bad as some critics claim. Though not perfect, it is enjoyable for sci-fi fans. It's also very family-friendly and not overly complex."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I liked Majors and Rudd. I am watching the movie cause of Rudd. When they try to put other characters in the front, it just doesn't work, cause its not their movie. Too much Pfeiffer, and Newton's performance was the worst. Zero depth. Zero connection with other actors. You can see she has no life experience and therefore can't act any struggle. You can see she is an entitled spoiled girl in real life, that has been just put into the movie. Marvel needs to stop giving roles to their friends but to actors who actually fit the role. That's how they created the first excellent phases."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,I wish time travel was used less in the MCU.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A piece of s‚Ä¶.
A new ¬´¬†black lives matter¬†¬ª movie with no idea. 
Marvel is dead"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is very good, because have bigs defects."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a great movie, and a great way to bring in the new Villain for the MCU!!"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not really adult entertainment more for the adolescent crowd really.  Nothing like watching a good Avengers movie!!
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The ""professional"" critics, if they can be called that, don't know what they're on about. This was a great movie and the general audience rating (which rightfully so is much higher) is reflective of that. Loved the movie. Would watch again."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie. It is visualy awesome, really beutiful besides all the CGI apllied, but was something that catch me up. I also think that the story is consistent (for a super hero movie, of course) and complete pretty weel the MCU by now.
Great acting from Jonhathan Majors.
Unnecessary participation of Bill Murray, a wasted of good talent in a very short scene that do not added nothing for the story."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst Marvel movies ever made. Cassie Lang is very annoying, Wasp does almost nothing the entire movie, Hank Pym is there for no reason, and the story is very simple.."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" on opening day. Some of the early reviews were less than stellar. My verdict? I really enjoyed it. It's a fun Ant-Man story that does a great job setting up ""Phase 5"" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Oh and Jonathan Majors who plays Kang is a serious badass! The new ""Thanos level"" baddie has arrived!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I felt the movie was good. It really put Ant-Man into a situation where he wasnt a developing hero any more, but an established one and really showed how much of a hero he really is."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Please watch it, there's a weird campaign against this movie...
It's an entertaining Marvel film and a food start to the Kang saga, and compared to the very 1st movies of the previous infinity saga, it's better than most of them...
Hopefully the movie does well on the box office and shuts them up forever"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a marvel fan, it's quite bad ngl. The only good point is Kang maybe"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,M.O.D.O.K. & Bill Murray were questionable. Kang was good and I don't even like Kang. DOOM  Kang... Decent movie.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"non mi √® piaciuto per niente, non aggiunge nulla alla trama. venite solo per la post credit asto punto lol."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,It wasnt the worst of the marvel movies but I wouldnt go see it again anytime soon. They didnt show Kangs true strength and felt boring at times
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the family vibes on this movie, no gae scene, everything is quite good"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The only expectation to take into this movie is that it's going to be weird. This movie is wild and funny and off-beat and I bloody loved it! Good stuff, excellent romp, amazing hang. Go have fun."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand why there's so much hate for this movie. I originally had it as a 3.5/5 and I revised my opinion to a 4/5 because it was pretty good. I'd highly recommend seeing it in theaters! The pacing was pretty good unlike Multiverse of Madness, and the plot made sense and didn't waste any characters unlike Love and Thunder. Jonathan Majors truly shined here, and while these movies catch a lot of flack for being too jokey, the humor fits in the Antman series. In my overall Marvel movie ranks, this is the top of Tier 3 and the best of the 3 movies. The biggest ding for me was the plot armor on the main characters. To me someone should have died or suffered an Infinity War-esque heartache. I do acknowledge though that they faced a Kang variant that was cut off from a lot of his resources so that could take some of that off."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was very fun and make the character evolve.
Scott become a ¬´¬†true¬†¬ª Avenger with sacrifice value.
For me it's the best Ant-Man movie.
Kang is really impressive, Jonathan Majors is a king"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics', listen to the fans, this is an epic deep Marvel film. Superb acting across the board, especially Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Amidst the high criticism, I enjoyed the ride of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Although the CGI and story was odd, Jonathan Majors continues his excellent acting as well as Paul Rudd in this forgettable yet enjoyable ride."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,very good movie i loved brocoli man
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie has a bad script, bad narrative, nothing engaging, nothing surprising, totally predictable, poorly explored characters.  I'm a comic book collector, a Marvel fan, I say with certainty that it is the worst Marvel movie so far."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"People shouldn't compare this movie to Infinity War or Endgame. Because it is not meant to be something like that. When you compare it to movies like the first two Thor movies or Iron-man 3 , It totally beats them- we meet a multiverse villain that will probably return in future films, there are plenty of good fight scenes, ups and downs, amazing visual effects, and some (but not to many) heartwarming moments. All in all it is a classic super-hero movie, and not a bad one at that."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Marvel movie at this point. I expected it to be fairly campy and comedy focused since it's Antman, and I think that's probably important. It's a wild ride through a different world than we've seen before. I enjoyed it and will watch it again. It's not a film study, it's just a fun movie to watch. It would be 4 or even 4.5 if it weren't for the TCBY commercials throughout the entire movie."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Only seen it once so far but will see it again as I'm sure I missed a lot. Enjoyed it though.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena pel√≠cula, es genial ver qu√© Marvel volvi√≥ a sus inicios , es as√≠ como me gustan las pel√≠culas de Marvel"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Its okay, but it has its ups and downs."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really good the visual effects of the quantum realm was excellent and the story was a perfect setup for the new movies and the introduction of kang and his set up was on point don't listen to the critics watch for yourself and make up your own mind opinion it was a great movie
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Way to much CGI.   Made my head spin.  Wanted to walk a few times.  D movie.   Not much fun for me.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was a lot of fun and reflected my standards as a Marvel movie. Recommended. I don't understand how critics can regard this film as low-level. They probably watched the film from a different point than a fantasy movie.
If you liked Shang-Chi and also Thor Love & Thunder then it's for you."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed this movie one of the better Marvel movies the MCU has put out. Additionally, Kang is badass in this movie. It was nice to finally get an idea of where Marvel is going."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think Marvel is getting tired. This movie is mediocre and it feels childish. The special effect was good but that's about it.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Complete mess, the story is rushed to get into the quatamania, once there the scale of the place is indeterminable, there is no character development for any of the leads, CGI is laughably bad at points and worst of all it's boring."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. A lot of humor and fun. Critics reviews aren't always accurate.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Literally there‚Äôs one reason I don‚Äôt give it a 4.5 and you‚Äôll know what it is exactly when you see it. Reintroduction of a character was botched so horrible even Marvel can‚Äôt deny it.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall a great film, and especially good for families. The story is fine, it was a nice adventure in the quantum realm. Jonathon Major's acting was really on point. The visuals for the movie are great too."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The film fails to create any real stakes or danger for the main character, and the villain is easily defeated in the end, despite being portrayed as powerful at first. Overall, it's a mediocre addition to the franchise that leaves much to be desired."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I had a great time watching it. I was pretty unsure going in because of misleading reviews but it was a great watch
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ant man and the wasp Quantumania was a flawed but fun superhero fair with good set up for the future and the cast charms
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. Couldn't think of a better way for them to introduce the quantum realm and ultimately kang, who they've been teasing a long time. Also loved the way how the beginning of the movie connects to loki s01 end"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a perfect example as to why we don't always listen to the critics on Rotten Tomatoes. This MCU project has a very similar feel to Multiverse of Madness for me, which was ALSO initially dogged on by the critics. Coincidence? My feeling is this, as the subject material becomes more complex (the multiverse/ quantum realm), Marvel, for obvious reasons, has to take a more avant-garde approach to their visuals & storytelling, and the ""critics"" simply aren't going to be on board when something is outside of what they've been conditioned to perceive as ""good filmmaking"". When most Marvel films have been more in line with ""Top Gun: Maverick"", the more recent, post-Endgame films will seem wilted by comparison to the ""tastemakers"". And honestly, complaining about the use of CGI in 2023 is such a boomer move. Hey Scorsese - I love ya, but you're out of your element here. So to hell with them, I say! Every performance in this movie was great, particularly Jonathan Majors. The new character additions were enjoyable, without overstaying their welcome. And can we just appreciate how great M.O.D.O.K. was in this? I felt we could have seem more of him. Only real issue for me was some of the dialogue. Some lines fall a little flat, simply for being painfully generic. And yes, the Marvel formula is on display here, but not enough to banish this movie to the quantum realm. All in all, I think our new MCU baddie in Kang the Conqueror will be one hell of a fight. A quality MCU entry that set up what's to come. Go see it when you can!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics that hate this movie hate fun. These critics serve no one but their own authority. They just jumped off the Marvel-boat when it was happily sailing through warm and clear waters because they want to be cool. The negative reviews have nothing to do with what they saw in the theaters. AMatW:Q is delightful. It's escapist, adventurous, fun, and super-weird. It's beautiful to watch. It's surprising. Go have your inner-child meter refilled. Enjoy fun."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great start to phase 5, a little corny in parts but so excited to see where the Kang story goes now"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The actors make this movie. It has some issues, like an ending that may seem all too familiar, but Paul Rudd, Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton really stand out."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its pretty funny, just like the other two. Pretty intense."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is good, CGI, and the visuals are stunning. I think it was the best ant-man in terms of story, because who wouldn't want to learn more about the Quantum realm. movie made but there something missing, The chemistry between Scott and Hope, and the gang, ""Three wombats"". I love luis on ant-man 1 & 2. Where the heck are they? Can't even show them a little bit on the first or last part on the movie ?"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Obvio le falt√≥ un poco m√°s de comicidad pero la verdad vale la pena para arrancar una nueva fase no esta mal, sin duda Kang salv√≥ el d√≠a!!!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Great. Better then wakanda never. Have no idea how you do such a good job on modok and then fail on King the conqueror.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it and visually stunning.  Decent storyline to kick off the Kang phase.   definitely felt like a piece of the puzzle and not a standalone story.  Modok was ridiculous,  which is pretty much true to the source.  let's not forget these are comic book movies, not indie art films."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action great, Kang was such a great villain,
The ants in the finale were such a funny addiction and R.I.P the greatest Avanger."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not terrible,  but not good.  Just Average.  If there were reshoots/changes to lighten what would've been a darker film, then those decisions were bad."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I didn't view this movie on a great screen, the colors were dark and the 3d was lack luster. Usually I would drive 45m North to see a movie like this on IMAX w/ Laser but between the weather and not wanting to drive much on my off day it is what was closest. This movie was probably the first that I've been able to get my 13 year old to willingly see in part to her friend that's a boy talked her into going. Hmmm. Anyways, this movie has it problems. Definitely nowhere near perfect. But does it suit a family theme & can you bring older kids [12+] into it and not have to explain the entire Infinity Saga? Sure. MODOK works for me as long as they bring him back somewhere, no one and done on that character. Majors steals the show along with Newton and Pfeiffer, and really for me the whole cast was decent. No problems there. The story was alright and I'm not worried about what score critics give because they aren't the overall statement that gets made at the box office. The holes in the story will eventually get filled in. I am not jumping off of the cliff with this one because it's a painful buildup to that next Endgame movie. People are expecting too much when they need to bring their expectations back down a bit to simplicity and reasonable. There's two end credit scenes. Go out and enjoy this for what it is, it ain't a bad movie."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Haven't enjoyed a marvel movie since End Game.  This was actually worse than the last Thor film.  I almost fell asleep and Kang was the only decent character, Cassie was annoying and full of herself, and I did not care about any of the other characters.  Only watched it because Emergency Awesome seemed to recommend it.  Not even disappointed, only felt foolish thinking it would actually be good."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Greatest ant-man movie yet! ‚ô•
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Ant man movie for sure! Loved it!!
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Don't believe the critics. This movie is awesome
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel fans will be the demise of Marvel Studios because as long as fans continue to watch these mediocre movies at best the studio will never try hard to make anything worthwhile
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,I didn't like the Quantumania effects.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed this movie. This movie lacked in story telling but made up in the action scenes. Out of a 10 I would give it a 7.5
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I do think they should have done a better job with the cgi like not using it as an often as they did or some scene where characters just look really fake  but overall the movie was great had funny moments and Majors does a fantastic job as kang
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I truly don't understand the critics. This movie was excellent :)
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"All I can say is that since End Game, ALL the Marvel movies have gone downhill. There may have been a couple funny lines in this, but other than that, one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, and I'm a HUGE Marvel fan!  Hopefully they don't mess up Guardians the same way they ruined Dr. Strange, Thor, & now Antman. How can you go from such GREAT movies, to absolute trash?"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film best of the newer ones don‚Äôt understand the hate from the critics
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,So so so so so so good! Loved it!!!
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome it‚Äôs a good set up to Marvels next phase.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"They did the most. Jokes felt forced. Ending was anticlimactic. They world building, I get it. But I didn't feel anything was ever really at stake. Kang was cool tho. Kids had a good time."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Visually stunning. Watch on big screen.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun movie to watch.  Just go watch it!
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the effects, fun movie"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring. You want to like it because it's a marvel movie but I found myself falling asleep and checking the time, just wanting to get out of there. 

SPOILERS 
The only funny part was Darren"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Yea, not very good.  CG was average, acting was OK.  Most perplexing thing was that the story doesn't move towards anything, if you saw Loki you could completely miss this movie, and you would be fine!"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,So disappointing. Johnathan Majors earns it a whole star and saves it from being a 1-star film for me. One of the most disappointing MCU movies and had to post here on Rotten Tomatoes. It might be the movie that makes me stop watching all the MCU movies in theatres.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,I went to see this movie with my parents and I am a fan of Marvel but this movie was so meh. There was a lot of CGI. I didn't understand the plot. Ant man could not fight. He got beat so bad by Kang. The wasp had little to no screen time. It was a let down. I was surprised. Wakanda Forever was better.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Thought it was better than the second one but not as good as the first one. A lot of missed and botched opportunities with the film but passable.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I went to watch the movie expecting a big disappointment thanks to the reviews from critics but I was hugely surprised. The CGI looks better than any Marvel movie released last year, and I know there are some negative reactions about MODOK's design but I think it was done on purpose, it's funny and it's uncomfortable to watch in a way that the only thing left to do is laugh at how ridiculous it looks. It's not a sad movie but my heart was touched every time Scott put Cassie as his number one priority. If I had to criticize anything, it would be that a couple many of jokes didn't land well and I really disliked the performance of the actress who plays Cassie."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Oh dear... I usually enjoy these movies, but this one was a stinker, which was really a shame because the cast was stellar. But the pacing was oddly slow, characters were disconnected, dialogue was painfully cliche, nothing interesting happened, battles were just a lot of noise, nothing really at stake. I couldn't wait for it to be over, sadly."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was okay, better than the second one I thought, & better than the Marvel films released last year I thought. Hoping Guardians of the Galaxy 3 turns out well!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie loved the action !
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Overall a pretty good movie. Would've gotten 95% if Luis was in it with a recap of what happened.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Good action film plenty of special effects!
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome ,great story and action"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"In my opinion, the Marvel Universe was spread too thin by new characters and stories since the conclusion of Endgame. I enjoyed my time with Ant Man 3 because it feels like we are finally building to some connected story line that made going to the movies in the 2010's so special. There were a few moments that made me lower my score of the movie: 
- The repetitive use of a curse word at the end felt edgy for the sake of being edgy.
- The movie is predictable if you've seen Loki or the trailer.
- It feels like there are so many super genius teenagers popping up out of nowhere. With Spiderman being the most popular character/movies these days (just off of internet vibes), it feels like an overused character archetype considering we already had MJ and Ned filling the role.    

Still, I enjoyed this movie and was surprised to see such negative critic reviews. It was worth seeing in theaters but I understand waiting to see it on Disney+."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the plot and the acting.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can't for the life of me figure out why I keep seeing these plodding, copy and paste, ""Wah another comic book movie"" college thesis length reviewer slogs. If it is as unpleasant as they claim, then in the words of my father, ""Don't watch it dummy"". The good in the move is that it is funny, vibrant and moves at a pace that neither leaves you confused or bored. Even with the change of actress for Scott Lang's daughter the cast does a great job combining fast paced action with entertaining dialogue. The scale of the Quantomverse feels large and alien which I really enjoyed. Each of the characters get their time to shine and the villain feels like the next big marvel baddie that he is supposed to be. This movie feels like marvel finally got it footing back especially with the disaster that Thor: love and thunder was. Now that doesn't mean there weren't some blunders some of the fight scenes because of scale got a bit muddled, and there were a multitude of side characters that didn't get enough time to really build any attachment to. I also wish there had been a bit more feeling of stakes towards the end but outside of these complaints I had an absolute blast. If you are a marvel fan then I feel like you will enjoy this newest installment."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the perfect movie for IMAX 3D. You became fully immersed in another reality. The whole family enjoyed it, ideal mix of action and humor."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfectly awesome comic book movie. 
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,fun exhilarating movie with loads of action everyone in my fam enjoyed it through and through even my 89 yr old mother definitely a fam movie full of excitement!!
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,SPOILER: Can someone explain to me how Kang has ‚Äúkilled Thor‚Äù but he loses to Antman? SMH this movie was a bit too juvenile and cringe for me.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Thought was a fun film. Nice entry in the MCU . 
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie delivered what I always hope to get from a Marvel Studios film... spectacular battles, compelling villains, and end credit scenes that leave me begging for more!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was solid. Not in the top 10, bet still up there."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"They said I love buch time, good for a 5 year old"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"How much can you really do with the multiverse in a film? This was mostly special effects and  Paul Rudd being Paul. If he says I love you Peanut one more time, Im going to scream. As well as Michelle saying Still calling Hope Jellybean every time she talks to Hope. The writing was lacking. A couple of highlights:  after 30 hrs in the multiverse mom, a scientist doesnt tell her family how Fd up it is, oh and I have an arch enemy who is taking over worlds. Also, mom kinda looks raggedy in the lab disheveled & not in that pretty  I just got out of bed & look great way and is not wearing makeup. Then when shes transported into the multi-verse, shes suddenly a stone cold fox with elaborate make up and hair that people pay hundreds of dollars for to get that look. Lol!
I am a big fan of the MU but this wasnt a winner for me.  The humor is here and I love that."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,I have never seen such boring Marvel movie like this.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The whole movie. Was awesome in my opinion.. 
intro to Kang was amazing.. gonna be a long battle who these next Avengers!!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best of the Ant-man movies so far. Feels especially refreshing after Thor Love and Thunder was such a disappointment.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It wasnt as fun as the first two. Special effects at time were choppy. Modok is another ruined character. 

To be honest and maybe Im the only one, but I dont think Jonathan Majors is all that good for the role. And the first post credit scene was super meh."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel is struggling trying to make movies for too wide an audience. It appeals to children, but then has a bunch of unnecessary and forced cursing to appear edgy enough for a mature audience. Just write a good story. Very flimsy plot with unnecessary characters. The one bright spot was  Jonathan Major's acting. Too bad it was wasted."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Bem divertido e leve...
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Trying to hard to be Star Wars
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Mediocre movie. Some of the dialogue was horrendous. Not worth wasting money on .
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,major eye candy and I love it!!
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So like, there were ants. This exterminator wanted to kill them all but wasps were there with a army of other bug looking things to fight. There was also a nightmarish looking floating head. I thought I saw Catwoman talking to a Ghostbuster?. It was a basic trippy story with no point. I was entertained sometimes but it wasn't all the time."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was great. The critics can suck it.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic and fun!! MCU keeps the story going and it's a great introduction for Kang! As good as GOTG!
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pel√≠cula es muy buena, pese a que tiene varios grises en el gui√≥n esta bien llevada. Visualmente es muy buena, presenta un villana o para el futuro y si tenemos en cuenta que no deja de ser un film individual de un personaje es excelente."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Daughter enjoyed it!
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very average for a Marvel movie
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow this was bad.  Awful vomited up special effects, ( I know it's not the special effects people's fault)  awful writing.  Corny jokes in the wrong places. The actors did well and Johnathan Majors as Kang was good but was severely misplaced being in this film. He seems nowhere near as threatening as Thanos but could have been if used properly and the mid credits scene made it even worse. So goofy and terrible. Marvel is mortally wounded since Endgame. I fear it's time is nearly over"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story. Really enjoyed all aspects of the Quantum realm. Very cool inventive characters dwell in the Quantum realm. Loved Paul Rudd and Jonathon Majors performances.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fun movie to watch for the first time in theatres but i dont really see myself rewatching it because theres better mcu movies i can watch instead
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"After Credits scenes, left me with more questions. I liked the movie."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this movie. It had the right amount of funny and a great intro to the next phase of the MCU.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the cgi and action
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Great visuals and story line.perfect cast too!
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Really great. Best Ant Man movie thus far and also great start of Phase 5 of MCU!
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don‚Äôt understand the hate, fun movie with a great villain. Great setup for phase 5"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,King shouldnt have died at the end lol but awesome movie
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice setup for the next avengers movie!
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too, too much of everything. Too many effects, too close together, making too little sense. After you've seen 93,498 explosions, death rays and near misses, it's all so ho-hum. Nice cast, though."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great cast, great graphics and really well done:)"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked this movie
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Liked the story and its delivery but it seemed like a rehash of a typical formula where the hero overcomes insurmountable odds
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"E uma trama um pouco fraca e mal desenvolvida, √© um filme esteticamente bonita"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie.  Also loved the service by the man who cleaned the theater.   SUPER NICE GUY!!!!
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Not sure why critics are trashing this movie I laughed and was entertained...and got to see Kang...movies are for taking you on a journey and having fun...it's a comic book movie not the freaking God father jeez...take the kids have fun eat some popcorn...it was worth 2 hours of my life
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,movie was awesome üëåüèø
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film marries the fun, humorous predecessors in the Antman trilogy, the adventure of wizard of Oz, and the odd characters of Rick and Morty. I loved the adventure start to finish, and find it crazy how these reviews can be so mixed. Definitely worth AT LEAST one viewing."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eu achei o filme Bem legal me agradou bastante, claro que eu n√£o estava esperando um filme √©pico estamos no come√ßo da fase 5 do ucm. O que eu esperava era um filme sobre o homem formiga que abordace os efeitos colaterais do scott leng ter ficado longe da filha novamente por conta dos acontecimentos de vingadores ultimato , al√©m de mostrar o reino Qu√¢ntico que eu achei incrivel E Apresentar um Vil√£o do multiverso e suas variantes e me foi entregue isso! √â um Filme feij√£o com Arroz muito Bom!!!"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was okay. I think I‚Äôm getting tired of all the CGI.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is a large scale film, with some very intriguing plot-lines and characters. However, the thing that draws me back is the cheesy set up within the movie. Spoilers ahead: when the audience finds out that hank had been receiving signals from the ants, I personally feel like the clues to that should have been a little more subtle, and not only were the clues obvious, but they also did a montage of flashbacks of him receiving the signals. That's one specific thing I found a little cheesy. The movie is pretty mediocre, and the one thing that sets this movie apart from films like Thor: Love and Thunder or Captain Marvel is Jonathan Majors. He had a spectacular performance, and not only did this raise my initial 2.5/5 rating of this movie to 3.5, but this movie hypes his future in the MCU, and not only am I so incredibly looking forward to him to star in films like The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars, but his journey in general as an actor. Paul Rudd did great as he always does in his role, however I am a little disappointed with the little involvement Lilly's character had in the story. A little odd for one of the title characters in the title of ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" to barely be featured as a main role in the plot. I also feel there could have been a little more done with Cassie, but I thought Kathryn Newton did very well. I also feel the set-up for future films got be very excited, and made my overall view of the movie a little better."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm not sure what all the negative feedback is about because this is a solid film on par with any Infinity Saga entry and hands down the best Ant Man film of the trilogy.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was better than I expected
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"While there was something missing from this movie, I enjoyed watching it and think the ratings were more cruel than they should be.  It‚Äôs a solid 65-80%, depending on how critical they are.   Johnathan Winters kills it, and it was great seeing a fun cameo appearance alongside Michelle Pfiffer and Michael Douglas.  Paul Rudd was also great.   Looking forward to more!"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie connected everything we learned in Phase 4 of the MCU and it made sense of everything.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,this movie is a dumb fun ride but can get cheesey at times kang is a stand out
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not a bad movie or good. If you wonder if you should see this movie it's a great question. Kang isn't a thrilling villian at all. The story line wasn't half bad (compared to doc strange 2 and the sobbing mother story line üòë). It had beautiful visuals and I liked all the characters. However, it was slow moving at times, painful jokes with some landing and some not, and a story line heading into the next phase of the MCU I find boring. So yes it's worth seeing  because this movie is the prequel to what will happen but really it wasn't amazing (and still not bad)."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what critics were thinking, but this movie was really good. Definitely the best of the three ant man movies."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun! Well-written, witty, great special effects."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As a Marvel fan I could say that, since it rappresents the begginning of a new phase of the MCU, they did a decent job! I personally didn't like how they introduced Ant-man's daughter character since she is randomly appassionate of the quantum realm without a little bit of an introduction on the argument. I think it would be better to show something as an intro in order to understand how she became keen on this new ""passion"". 
I'm disappointed though that they basically snobbed The Wasp who barely partecipates at the main events.
Introduction of the Kang ""affair"", I'm a bit confused but as an intro for a new villain I think is a solid base that opens an opportunity for more explanation in future movies/series. It's a solid base to introduce the concept but I think a little more details in this movie wouldn't hurt."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was just entertaining. If you are going to watch for a 5 star movie, this is not it."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the movie, excited for the future!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Gui√≥n y direcci√≥n muy flojos. Entretenida sin m√°s.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm done with the MCU, they have lost touch with what made this a great thing."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie proves why the critics are so out of touch and we pay no attention to them. 
The critics gave Thor Love and Thunder 64% and this movie 48%. This movie is a fun ride after a few below average movies and clearly sets up the next few years. Jonathan Majors as Khang performs really well. The comedy is just right and not too much which you would expect from an Antman movie. There are no slow moments and the pace is steady since there is a lot to fit in the 2 hours 4 minutes."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It is an amazing movie for the franchise I promise you will enjoy
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie and overall theme of helping others. Awesome character development with the Stinger and Kang!!
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Had a lot of simulates as other shows., Dr. Strange to name a few!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A solid 3.6 
Pretty good but not at all great."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, the best of the ant man saga."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,I'll Give it 3 and a half to four stars. Why? because it still made sense. I also get why it made sense why a lot of people didn't like it. but the whole point of the movie was supposed to be an introduction to Kang the Conqueror which i will admit Jonathan Majors does do an incredible job playing. I do pray that the allegations against him aren't true. because I think Jonathan Majors is in incredible Kang the Conqueror. Corey Stoll as MODOK did disappoint me. because MODOK Isnt supoosed to be a Comedy act. he's supposed to killing machine. There were also some very cheesy moments but all in all the story made sense because again the whole point is supposed to be an introduction to the Actual Kang the Conqueror. strongly still recommend the movie
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good movie and Kang is a true antagonist.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Enquanto a Marvel querer ficar de militncia, vai cada vez mais fazer obras porcas, como essa. Roteiro lixo, acabaram com o Modok e colocaram dilogos horrveis."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rudd and Majors carry the movie enough to make you stay till the end, and than wish you hadn't. My daughter said it best ""that was a very very bad star wars movie with marvel characters in it""..."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was good, not worth the 22 bucks,  to see. Thanks to the obidens!!!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely not as good as the first two but certainly still a fine installment in the ant man series and MCU as a whole. Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors gave phenomenal performances. Kang so far has proven a worthy follow up from Thanos as the MCU's next big villain.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This wasn't my favorite Marvel movie, but I liked it and am glad I saw it on the big screen."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie for what it was trying to do I look at it like the first captain America and. Captain marvel u understand why it have to exist but I never need to see it again solid 6out of 10
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Yikes! One of the most abysmal storytelling attempts ever put on the big screen. The characters have no arc, The acting is beyond terrible, and the retreading of the same big cgi ‚Äúset pieces‚Äù are tired at best"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie that doesn't deserve so much hate. 7/10 but Kang wins some extra points, he stole the show."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked everything but the socialism joke hank made.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""The worst Marvel movie:
Forced plot, bad jokes, and a copied Star Wars setting."""
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Has it all. Storyline, action, special effects. Another home run for marvel."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,If this was the beginning of Phase 5 - woof.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Entertaining but both my colleagues and myself said the same thing afterwards.... felt a bit star warszy... Comedy was spot on.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Do not understand the low critic score for this one.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The plot is sub par for a Marvel flick. But the Ants and the people in the other realm kick ass. If Marvel intended to do better with recasting Cassie, they missed terribly. The second post credit scene is awesome. Worth the two plus hours to see those Marvel characters before the summer."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,honestly great movie but it hs downsides
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"While it was a crazy ride, it was a fun and awesome look at the Quantum Realm.  Majors was awesome, and the film was exciting!  Critics have Marvel withdrawal, it was a good movie!!!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall this movie feels like a filler episode in a TV show. But that being said, I really liked it. It was very entertaining. I will say though, I think Marvel is still struggling to find a good balance between humor and seriousness. Some of the humor was too over the top for me, but not nearly as bad as thor 4. This is a win in my books even if it didn't end the way I was hoping for. It was still an entertaining movie - much better than recent marvel"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The Movie started slow but ended with a Bang. Kang was a big enemy. CGI was Well too and the Story aswell.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I laughed watching this movie and it was just entertaining
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Surprisingly sub sub-par. Corny,.Cheesy, predictable, and cheap laughs‚Ä¶.humor was junior high-ish. "
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it ties in perfectly to the next marvel phase. It's definitely a must see.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie overall, 100% recommend to go watch it. The CGI has improved and the story was alright for the setting being the quantum realm. Kang was fire and the introduction of older Cassie was good."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This one so much better compared to the recent marvel movies like thor & Dr strange, IDK why RT is so low"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Was amazing. The critics are idiots amd dont have a clue what they are doing.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Really a fun and entertaining!!!!!
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was better than marvels recent films. But nothing groundbreaking. Missing some key characters from the past antman films.. but still manages to find humor only Paul rudd can provide. Solid movie
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,rick and morty but not funny
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was perfectly fine. It's an above average Marvel movie. It tied into the tv shows well and the major intro of Kang was well done. Jonathan Majors is great, Paul Rudd does his usual thing and the story itself was fine. The ‚ÄòCritics' couldn't be more wrong."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fun 
People expect so much and expect every theory they see to happen 
Don't look to much into it and just enjoy it 
It's ANTMAN."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Leaving me wanting more. Action packed.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was good! Not the best MCU movie out there, but definitely not worthy of a rotten rating. If you're an MCU fan, you'll like it."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"All CGI with no acting, unless you just like to see people running for 2 hours. This franchise is toast!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Maybe Spoilers:

It is definitely not the same film that the trailers conveyed.  This film serves as only a setup for Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars.  Half of the Ant Family has no relevance to the plot and just stands around, emoting.  Cassie's personality was changed drastically.  For someone who lost their dad for 5 years, she is unwaveringly belligerent towards her father for wanting to be with his family instead of doing heroics.  Janet is super annoying for no reason, withholding critical information so the movie can exist for longer than a few minutes.  The only good characters in the film were Scott, Kang, and the mf that looks like the Pixar lamp on tren.  There are no stakes, no consequences, and no lessons learned.  The conflict and adversity in the film are superficial and resolved super easily, barely an inconvenience.  What was cool about the Quantum Realm is gone.  It went from an abstract dimension beneath atoms to a cheap copy of Star Wars and Rick & Morty.  The CGI is unfinished.  Kang, who has killed multiple Avengers line-ups in multiple timelines, the man called the Conquerer, gets BM'd by ants."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think this movie is better than critics are saying.  It is not a life changing film, but fun adventure filled with light hearted humor."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Majors Carried the Schmuck out of this movie, Can't tell me otherwise. The Movie wasn't bad, But it wasn't entirely good either. But It's an Ant-man Film, I wasn't expecting an Endgame level Performance. However, The Writing was poor, the CGI Sucked, (M.O.D.O.K) They Shouldn't have shown his face. The Design was fire until They could've explained that it was Darren without showing the dude's Face, and he Action Scenes Hurt to Watch.
Honestly think Ant-Man should have died after he said ""I don't have to win, We both just have to Lose."" First of all, the Most obvious thing, A Guy with Shrinking powers Fights a Guy who claimed to have Murdered Different Avengers from Different Multiverses, That's like putting a Chihuahua to fight against an A schmucking Alligator. Second, It would have been perfect and set the Stage for a Young Avengers Movie. It would have shown the strength of Kang and backed up his claim of killing many Avengers. 
OR Kang and Antman could've been Left Stranded in the Quantum Realm,"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this movie. I have seen every marvel movie and show. They been talking about quantum realm since antman 1 so not suppose whole movie took place in quantum realm. It was a fun movie and pretty funny and good action. Can‚Äôt wait for more Kang 
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie the MCU has made since Spider-man No Way Home. I didn‚Äôt find one Woke reference in the movie which was refreshing. It was funny, entertaining and Johnathan Majors was great and definitely showed that there is a new threat to the avengers on par with Thanos."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It took us ~8 years and 20 movies to build up to the Epic ""Event Level"" Avengers Infinity War & Avengers End Game‚Ä¶. And for some reason, both critics & fans, seem to expect EVERY new movie to be on IW & EG's level..?!??  It's just not possible, and it's unrealistic to expect that to happen.  But to me, this movie more than lived up to the hype!  Rudd & Crew did a fantastic job, and Majors absolutely stole the show!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant man and the Wasp - Quantimania is fun and enjoyable. Building on the two previous Ant Man films it is a logical progression, including other films in the Marvel Universe which, appropriately are mentioned throught the film.
Personally I enjoyed it. I found it entertaining, lots of the same type of humor as in the previous fils, and the addition of Scott Lang's daughter was well done/ (Beginning the film witrh her in jail was a wonderful nod to Scott's history, fotunately her incarceration was from a protest that she'd been a part of.
They retun to the quantum relm unwillingly and all tpyes of new adventuires insue, ans of course the quintet of heros is called upon save the day! Yes quintet, even the daughter now has a suit, to Scott's surprise, especially as he becomes a mentor in Shrining and fighting. OH, and the guest appearance but an actor known for comedy and adventure is an amazing surprise! 
I understyand that some (or many) professional critics may find fault with the film, but then again it wasn't written or produced with the expectation to win a ""Best Picture"" Oscar.  It was written to build on the previous films and does so wonderfully. (Although I do miss the two nearly incometant sidekicks). This is not a film to deeply contemplate, it is a film to sit back and enjoy, It's a shame more pro critics dont understand that!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I liked the first two Ant Man movies, but this one was a disappointment. Just an over done CGI fest with characters who always know everything and always make the right choices in most every situation. It seems like every supporting character is a physics super genius with abilities that exceed any possible logic. If you need to see this, save your money and wait for streaming."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Dont really like direction Marvel
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I absolutely don't understand why this movie has gotten such bad reviews on some sites. It was a good movie. Not great. Not the best. Not Endgame or Winter Soldier. But it was a solid, entertaining, Marvel movie."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I had a fun time with a movie that has really ups and downs. The CGI can be quite nice in some scenes, but other scenes have horrible CGI. I am not quite sure what Feige wants to do with the MCU, I had hopes that this movie gives answers to that and it did, but not really like I anticipated."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining, you must see Loki the tv series to make sense out of it critics don't understand this."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Just take a second and close your eyes and capture a picture of the scenes. The movie plays out like a joy ride comic. Scene after scene is full of interesting conversation and plot development and jokes. It feels deep rooted as a comic movie and it should be enjoyed as such.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Good visuals and acting.  However, visuals outshined by goofy villain motive, a character demise in the 2nd half who suddenly appears again without explanation, and a very poor and almost comical setup for phase 5 and Avengers: Secret Wars."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Corny, not really funny. Ant man is a great title but this 3rd one sucked. I could not wait till it was over"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Es una excelente pel√≠cula
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are wrong, that's all I can say.  Best Marvel movie in quite a while.  Marvel has improved lately with first, Wakanda Forever and now Quantumania.  Make your decisions for yourself."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I've come to the conclusion that critics don't know what fun is and are entirely disconnected from reality.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well the movie is very entertaining and if you like to think deep about the possibilities of the metaverse and its near infinite implications, this is fun and deep take.  Haters have specific and oversimplified opinions about the quantum realm as if their OPINION is the master criticism were movies should succeed or die according to them. Too simple to dismiss this movie like that. Enjoy the movie. Cheers haters!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Missed Oppurtunity, this movie was ok.., not the best movie in the trilogy, probably should've been a little longer. It could've been so much better though. CGI was great. However, Jonathan Majors is perfect as Kang! He really stands out. I have no idea why in hell the critics would rate it lower than 60%, any one who rates it lower than 60% clearly hate the movie. To enjoy this movie you have to view it as an episode 1. Because, unfortunately it isn't a very good standalone film and definitely not a good ending to the ant man trilogy."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure why this is getting slammed so hard. We found it entertaining, and it had me laughing through the whole movie."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was too long (and it wasn't that long of a movie!) It wasn't funny, the CGI was mid at best, the acting was good, but the story sucked. Just barely worth seeing if you like the MCU, but not a good first-time superhero movie. To use the common phrase: it sucks."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie is just special effects with some dialog in between. Just another Marvel movie.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The only issue I had with the movie was Scott's daughter being a Mary Sue genius when she showed none of that while she was growing up, she was just a regular kid. Kang was the best part of the movie other than that I enjoyed the movie."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It's was really good little to fast tbh but other wise great cast and interesting movie
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think folks who have read the comics (and are not a ""canon"" type of person) really enjoyed the movie for the action and for what the movie is intended to set up..."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Brilliant Film not sure what the critics are moaning about.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not the best of the Marvel films, but certainly better than others (Thor 2, Capt Marvel,  Eternals) and more fun than its forgettable predecessor in Ant-Man's second outing. The pace is good and never seems to drag."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of my best Ant-Man movie, and a great start for Phase 5 of the MCU."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is not as bad as the critics' scores, but not exactly perfect. It was very entertaining. The comedic moments were weaved in seamlessly and don't overpower the scenes when the emotional stakes are at play. The visuals were stunning and Johnathan Majors was excellent in his role."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Other than introducing Kang into the Multiverse Saga the movie was pointless.  I did  appreciate the visuals of the scenery and costumes.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's an amazing & refreshing movie from Marvel. The ""critics"" don't know sh*t about what they score. None of them know the history of Marvel or have even read a comic book. The characters in the movie, their mannerisms are so beautifully vivid. It is not overpowering, and it still retains the classic marvel 'comic relief'. Also, Jonathan Majors is class."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it a lot.  Was expecting it to be bad after watching Wakanda Forever and Love & Thunder.  Funny as hell too.  Hope we see more of the quantum realm!
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Masterpiece, It was very good"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,great sequel! cute laughs and will tie in nice to other franchise moives
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Decepci√≥n total, una historia vac√≠a y sin sentido. Odie a la nueva Cassie. üëé"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was far fetched and hard to follow what was going on.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"1st, there is no plot to this movie, it's nothing more than a vehicle to move the MCU along to the Kang Dynasty. These are mass market movies that strive to appeal to the most amount of people including children and the writing and dialogue reflects that. MODOK was funny at first but wore out his welcome with the bad and repetitive jokes. Kang dialogue doesn't fit with this movie at all as it was written and performed in a serious manner. These are children's movies nothing more and if you go in knowing that you'll have the right expectations for it. Oh yeah the ending, it's some real deus ex machina B.S. that everyone could see a mile away."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, action-packedjust left me wondering a little who Kang really is"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Johnathan Majors = That Dude
Movie was legitimately funny and Kang was awesome. Pacing needed improvement though."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Solid and fun, and a good Star-Warsy vibe in places. Kang was great and the visuals were excellent, but the tone and pacing was strange in places, and frankly MODOK ruined the entire movie for me."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring and bad script.   Ants cannot possibly save the world!
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was great. I wouldn't say it's the best Marvel movie but was a great addition to the first three. The Quantum concept was interesting. I think the original rotten tomatoes review was off.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I‚Äôm a big Marvel fan & been following it through comic books & the shows growing up watching & now through the live action. But what messed it up a little is the acting a little more of Ant-Man & his daughter which seems like it wasnt that much chemistry between each other, it‚Äôs like when some things happened to the father you expect a kid to get mad or show a side of themselves not wanting the thing to happen happen. So therefore no emotions was their when certain things happened. Hopefully next time, the chemistry between father & daughter is their."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,A movie that gets way too much hate and not enough credit to my liking.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not caring what the critics said (who does these days, they're garbage) I went to see this with my family and I thought it was great.  Not the best MCU movie to date, but still a great movie.  I think it was a good official introduction to Kang and laid a good foundation for normies to understand how Kang works via the mid/after credits scene."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very much enjoyed the movie. The visuals are fantastic and Khang plays a great villain. The movie sets of everything up very well for phase 5, which now I'm bery excited for where I was feeling a bit hesitant before."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If it wasn't for Michael Douglas' incredible performance, it would be 1/2 a star. Plot points were weak and all other acting was very average."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"so, ant-man and the wasp quantumania... i don't understand the hate that this movie is getting. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i enjoyed the movie. üëçwell, most of the movie... üòí there is a cgi character that looks absolutely horrible (like someone took a silly putty copy of his face and streched it out) üôÑ and they completely retconned the character's identity and voice... and not to make it better... üò† now on to the good:  JONATHAN MAJORS AS KANG WAS ONE OF THE BEST VILLIANS I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE! ü•∞ i'm excited to see what storylines the mid-credits scene will lead to üòÉ and the post-credits scene will only make sense if you kept up with a specific marvel show on disney+."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I felt like I was watching a Marvel meets Star Wars Action film. It was okay. I'm no Marvel expert, so I won't ever remember the backstories. I won't ever watch it again. And I did not fall asleep, so I give it a C+. I think the critics are biased. There is no way this was a 48%. It had a story, a plot, etc. It had big-name actors and they portrayed their parts well. I get it, it's not an Oscar-worthy movie but it was not awful. "
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Paul Rudd is the best thing to happen to the Marvel Universe he is always funny and super charming - this movie was fun to watch. It's sets up phase 5 and also introduces Kang - Jonathan Majors is an excellent addition. I was entertained throughout the whole movie. Maybe one cheesy joke from the daughter but I mean what marvel movie doesn't have a cheesy joke. Loved it.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a film that no doubt doesn't know what direction it wants to take, but it still managed to keep me entertained. The villain is the best thing about the film, for me."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I went to the Alamo drafthouse on Tuesday night where tickets where only 7 bucks and it still felt like i paid to much for this movie. Ant-Man and Wasp was so good and this felt like a bad disappointment compared to that. Nothing really bad overall but my girlfriend said she saw at least 20 times where i was acting like i was pushing the fast forward button if was in control of the movie. there was prolly only about 15-20 minutes of the movie that was interesting. the rest was just filler.

Quantumania was not a bad movie per se.  I would just recommend waiting for it to come out on Disney plus where you are paying a monthly fee for a bunch of movies and not 14 - 15 bucks for 1 very average flick."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was entertaining. There were some very funny parts.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought they did a fantastic job in showing the quantum realm. Yes, this does have a Star Wars vibe to it, with an 80's fantasy adventure twist, which is not a bad thing. Great movie, will watch again."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Like the action and the story
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"In order for this move to be successful, they needed the audience to fall in love with two things: The Quantum Realm, and Scott's relationship with Cassie. The problem is that they did neither.

The toughest part about bringing the Quantum Realm to life is that it could literally be any fantastical vision since it has no real basis in the real world. But it wasn't captivating enough to grab us. Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness brought us way more exciting visuals through different universes that we all wanted to be a part of. Black Panther's Atlantis brought to life a new city that had an entire history we could all grasp. At no point did I think the Quantum Realm was a place I wanted to be and [SPOILERS] by the time the people were riled up to take their home back, I kept thinking, ""I don't really care. You never really showed how much of an oasis it was before Kang.""

Next is Scott's relationship with Cassie. Peter and Tony had a stronger bond than these two and they weren't even related. They could have easily showed more flashbacks that helped influenced each character's decisions throughout the story, but we also felt nothing whenever their relationship was threatened."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Wasn't a perfect film because it felt short but definitely a good and film to watch. Felt it needed more of Kang.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love the this movie, one of the best Ant movie so far, the CG and the story line well done, Marvel did it again this is way the MCU is the best in doing movies."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Few scenes could have been cut , overall good and great introduction of an important  villain."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"actually, they showed everything in the trailer itself to increase hype... because of which audience alrdy predicted the correct story.....and didn't showed about quantum realm in more deep... and had big loop holes."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fabulous movie.  You must see in 3D, you will absolutely love it.  I'm going to see it again."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The story is boring and very predictable. A big NO for me.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is the same old script they have made over and over. Teen girl is amazing at technology, the daughter is a know it all, the hero isn't a hero and wasp girl still sucks. HATED this movie."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,I was expecting it to be funnier.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant man reaches epic proportions to kick off Phase 5 with a bang. Don't expect the light hearted touch of the previous movies but more of a darker, thrilling tone that delivers in all sizes."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,If the critics say its a bad movie then you know the movie is going to be awesome. Where do they get these biased critics from? smdh
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoy movies under the marvel series special effects were fanastic
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the action scenes and the visual effects! Its not an Avengers level movie, but its a really good Ant-man third chapter!!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The visuals were stunning! The character development was a little weak in some of the  characters but others really bloomed to life in this film. Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors stood out to me as far as their relationship and character development. This was a great introduction to one of many Kang variants and I really can't wait to see more of the universe and the character. I don't know what's not to like...aside from Modok...weak CGI but going into it I couldn't have imagined it looking better, he's a giant head with tiny arms...practical effect options would have looked equally strange I think so, yeah there you go. Better than I hoped for based on the early reviews I saw for the film and overall I'm happy with this entry in the franchise."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was Great in my opinion 
Kang was awesome 
And cgi looks great"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this film. There is a lot of CGI, which I loved. If you're not a fan of CGI, this film is not for you. In Ant-Man fashion there was a lot of humor spread throughout. Lots of new ""creatures"" both good and bad. The film definitely left me I wondering where the next chapter of the The Watcher story will play out. Can't wait."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a great movie! With laughs and action! Way better then the last Thor movie.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Was this a movie about Antman? More Social Engineering ruining movies.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Had high hopes for this one . 
Disappointing"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I like Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, and Jonathan Majors, but this was just a green screen showcase, which could be the only way to bring a Quantum realm to life. All the faults of the Star Wars prequel trilogy of poor script and not having the best interactions with the environment was on display here.

Im looking forward to seeing more of Kang but this movie was not worth the 55 for the three of us. Wait for Disney+ release and youll be fine."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was fantastic. It's exactly what you'd expect from an Ant-man movie, just on a much larger (albeit tinier) scale. 
Everything works, the jokes stick their landing, weird things in a weird world. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pheifer get a chance to stand out as the original Antman and Wasp, and Kang is a frighteningly terrific villain, Thanos level threat.

Lasting impressions: MODOK, Cassie Lang, Billy Murray's Kylar and all the Quantum Realm rebels were a hoot and really added to the momentum.

Bummers: Wish we had more of Bill Murray's character, but sometimes good things lose their flavor if given too much airtime. Also, it felt like Evangeline Lilly's Wasp was sidelined a lot of the movie. I wonder if she had a lot of cut dialogue."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than ant man and the wasp.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,multiverse of saga started
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was as wild and chaotic as I had hoped. There were some low points and risks that weren't taken, but this didn't detract from the fever dream enjoyment of the film. Kang steals the show in every scene. Best AntMan out of the three for sure though."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the visuals and sound. Story was good it continues the MCU series.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I do not understand the hate for this movie from critics.  I loved it!  Definitely in the upper 1/2 of the Marvel movies.  Critics never really wanted to like any of these comic movies so I think they feel more free to hate on them now.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally got to see certain characters step up their role. Great plot, awesome cgi, reminded me a bit of star wars universe. I recommend."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great and entertaining movie. Definitely the best marvel movie since Spider-man: No Way Home. Don't know why rotten tomatoes scores are so low.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie. Much better then phese five marvel movies. Fantastic CGI. I am satisfied. ü•∞ü•∞üòçüòç
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Most people are giving this movie a bad review because they expect every Marvel movie to be like Endgame. Most of the critics aren't clued up on Marvel characters outside the Avengers, and dont see what this movie is trying to do.

People need to understand that this is a movie that is a building block up to what lies ahead for the MCU the next few years(The Kang Dynasty). The Kang we see in this movie wont be the same Kang that will be in other movies. 

This movie was really good, and I say to you....go and see it and ignore the braindead critics and the people on social media bashing it. 

I can tell you if you stick with the upcoming phases of the MCU, it will blow your mind and blow Infinity War and Endgame out the water."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS OR PLOT POINTS*****First off, if you go to a superhero movie to take it seriously then you are bonkers. If you go to be entertained, then you are in for a treat, the movie was great- it sets a lot of things in motion going forward- When Paul Rudd was first cast to play Ant-Man, I was like WTF, not I cannot see anyone else playing him, but Ant-Man is a mantle and could be interchangeable with anyone- Johnathan Majors' Kang is the real deal and he is such a great actor-too bad he has to be the bad guy. I liked the introduction of new characters specific to the Quantum Realm- I enjoyed the movie thoroughly- because I DON'T TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY- I grew up reading the comics and I am okay with ANYBODY taking up different mantles- and when you throw in the multiverse- anything can happen- Back to the movie- the entire dynamic between Hank, Scott, Hope, and Janet, and Cassie is a breath of air. Please go see the movie- it is very ENTERTAINING."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"While it's not as good as ant man and wasp, in my opinion, it's still a fun movie to watch.  I saw it in 2 d and thought it was a funny and campy movie, as ant man movies are.  Good back story with new characters.  My husband thought some of the scenes reminded him of star wars type scenes.  Well Disney does own both now so...if course.    It was a funny movie at a little over 2 hrs, perfect length of time for this installment.   Can't wait to see what's next.  Better than any dc movie that's for sure."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good story, great special effects!!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Don't spend time or money on this movie.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,DEFINITELY TOP 10 MCU MOVIES FOR ME. AMAZING. I JUST CAME FROM THEATER WATCHING IT.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Paul Rudd and the humor in the movie: both top tier. The critics are wrong this movie was great
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a great step in the progression of the Kang villain saga. It really set him up as a 'boss' bad guy. I love where this one is going and cannot wait for Loki season 2.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel, stop being a d"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Embarrassingly bad and cringy. Every character irritating apart from Scott Lang who still doesn't feel his usual self and Kang the Conqueror. This movie is not the third installment in the Ant Man trilogy but a quick two hour explanation of who our next big bad is.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was exactly what it was supposed to be. 
We enjoyed it. Ignore the critics."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant Man 3 is entertaining.  It sets up future Marvel movies, while standing alone as an enjoyable action movie. 

How the critic score is below 70% is laughable, but serves as a reminder that critic reviews are wrong and worthless to the people that matter:  THE AUDIENCE."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not the worst movie in itself but Kevin feige has said they have a post mortem on all projects to understand what went well and what didn't, yet they seem to be making the same mistakes. Kang is supposed to replace Thanos and I'm sorry but there is no way a single avenger and sidekick could defeat Thanos and yet Kang dies. This is not how you build an enemy."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this film. I know some people will likely feel differently and that's fine, but for me, Majors was fantastic. The silliness went a little over the top at times, but no where near as bad as say the last Thor movie. 
Overall, a strong opening for phase 5."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"2/10. What a boring mess of a movie. The worst aspect was how unbelievably bad the editing was. Scenes started and ended with no flow. Was I having a stroke? The actress playing Cassie is pretty bad. Modok looked horrendous and was goofy. The story is fairly lame and the visuals are a mess. Sad I wasted $16 on this. The only redeeming quality was Jonathan Majors, and even he wasn't enough to save this.  Oh yeah, that mid credit scene was f#% corny as hell. What a #%^^ joke.

Edit. Why am I allowed to review anything when my sentence structure is so bad."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a great kick off to the new phase of marvel movies, acting was great, each scene look fantastic, had some good laughs during it a good blend of it to say and finally the story was a good one not a great one but it was nice"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was great! It definitely had a few weird moments and to be honest it did feel like a Rick and Morty episode with tons of different aliens and creatures but Marvel did a great job at introducing the MCU's next biggest villain Kang The Conqueror.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than Wakanda Forever, this follows the trajectory of Thor:Ragnarok very closely but lacks the grandiose violence, language and innuendo that made Ragnarok so popular. Splice that with pointless post credit scenes and you'd argue the film is no good.
And yet the film has so much Charm- Johnathan majors was one monologue from an Oscar I'd argue, overcoming some clumsy lines. So good it's no surprise he has an avengers film named after him.
Pfeiffer and Douglas are fun and entertaining but tired all the same, barely as vocal or agile as their counterparts.
Bill Murray was wasted.
But the story is still fresh. Still mind boggling and unsettling.
If Kang had only proven a worthier opponent in the last Act there would be no complaints from me."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It's Marvel.  What is there not to like?
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A trama embasada entre o Scott e a Kesie √© muito boa, pois traz uma rela√ß√£o de (re)conhecimento entre pai e filha ap√≥s ficarem 5 anos longe um do outro. Personagens secund√°rios como os pais da Hope tamb√©m tem revela√ß√µes boas, principalmente a Janet, que traz algumas revela√ß√µes de seu passado dentro do reino qu√¢ntico. O vil√£o Kang √© bem introduzido, apresente a hist√≥ria dessa nova variante, e nos faz conhecer mais sobre o antagonista. Modok aparece todo deformado e, a ideia de transformar o primeiro vil√£o do filme nesse vil√£o adicional √© incr√≠vel. Os leves toques de Star Wars e de outros filmes conhecidos da cultura pop, trazem bons momentos ao filme. As lutas que referenciam outras grandes produ√ß√µes da Marvel tamb√©m puxam a aten√ß√£o dos f√£s. Os diretores n√£o se arriscam muito, mas poderiam trazer mais destaques para o universo contido no reino qu√¢ntico, al√©m de uma trama maior, at√© mesmo com a morte de algum personagem importante...
Em geral, o filme √© bom. Diverte, prende o telespectador, mant√©m a aten√ß√£o aos personagens principais e ainda mant√©m a amea√ßa do grande vil√£o da fase 5 do MCU."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cassie Lang is a hero for Younger Millenials, GenZ to look up to. This version of Kang is scary if hampered and somewhjat de-powered by his confinement in this space. The script suffers from some tropey uses of ""the pronoun game"" and ""silence to protect you"". I was dissapointed that William Jackson Harper is pretty much confirmed NOT to be Reed Richards now. Action is outstanding. A lot of exciting moments. Comic Stans will be pleased with the epiloge and trailer easter eggs."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Estuvo muy buena, creo que la duraci√≥n de la pel√≠cula esta mas que bien, algunos efectos como el CGI se ven algo extra√±os pero la pel√≠cula esta bien, es entretenida y disfrutable, como fan del UCM desde sus inicios, no la considero la mejor de todas pero si la mejor de la trilog√≠a, puede que haya un agujero de guion en cuanto a Kang y el no poseer part√≠culas pym ya que al este ser del futuro deber√≠a de saber, yo creo que es porque no lo consideraba relevante, hasta que lo usaron en su contra, as√≠ que podr√≠a estar resuelta esa parte, en fin, me gusto la pel√≠cula"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a perfectly good movie. Not an excellent movie but I felt it met the high bar of a solid and enjoyable Marvel film that was impactful in setting up future movies and conflicts. How movie critics can give this a 47% is crazy. Perhaps they're fatigued by them and jaded, but gees. Get over yourselves. 

Not as fun or playful as past Antman movies, but that was probably necessary to highlight the significant threat Kang presents. Jonathon Majors was great as was Kathryn Newton. The world-building of the quantum realm was fun and crazy, very sci-fi feeling. I enjoyed it and look forward to what's next!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"RT critics are wrong. The show opens with Paul Rudd walking down the street monologuing, and I could watch a whole TV show of that.  Looking forward to more Kang in the future (Majors was good). Bill Murray was a fun cameo. I don't feel they used The Wasp to her potential unless the title was referring to Ant-Man and The Wasp's Mom The First Wasp. Loved Veb the jelly guy. Bottom Line: I was entertained by the movie."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It had it flaws and it felt completely different to the previous Antman movies but overall a solid movie and a great introduction to the Multiverse sage's 'big bad'.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was good, but not... good. The visuals were stunning, but I was bored most of the time. Kang carried the whole movie for me, and I was honestly more excited about the stingers than the actual film. I really don't think ant-man deserved this ending for such fantastic earlier movies."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it and Kang was scary as hell, tbh dont know why its getting so much hate, its ant-man a marvel character that doesnt have that much GREAT and CRAZY stories in the comics but here it pulls off a really good plot-line in which they explore the quantum realm which makes sense with the previous movies in the franchise of ant-man."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the movie stood up to its own storyline very well and the CGI was very well done. I think the MCU is expanding at a rate that is going to be problematic to manage for creators but they've done all right so far. I'm a bit bemused at all the negativity and criticism thrown at the franchise. I get it, if it didn't unfold the way someone thought it would, but the way they chose to do it has been reasonably and a professionally well done. My concern moving forward is that the ever increasing complexity of the universe will dilute/compromise the storylines. I guess we'll see!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bottom of Marvel favorite list.  Just seemed to much like comic for toddlers.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the funnest Marvel films in a bit! Visually stunning, and full of humor and heart. Plus this does a pretty decent job of setting a lot of the future story line in a pretty exciting way. I am actually finally very invested in where this plot device is going. Kang is a worthy villain and I really look forward to learning more of his motivation and back story. I went in to this not expecting too much after Multiverse of Madness really let me down but this has renewed my faith in the MCU! I saw this in a Dbox/ motion seat and it also added a layer of fun and immersion to the movies exquisite scenes. I also really enjoyed the costumes and the make up effects- excellent world building and character design."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie! Nice visuals 
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Disappointing. I love Antman but not this. Too early Star Wars. Story not believable. No Luis and his mates.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So this is what the MCU has become. They have spent so much time on identity politics that they've forgotten how to write a meaningful, coherent story- and I believe they truly tried with Antman 3. Paul Rudd managed to maintain the personality we all love of Scott Lang, because well, it's like ever other lovable Paul Rudd character. Outside of that, we have a bunch of this happens because we say so moments, and when they do try to explain, their one-line justifications are believable enough to buy into. For example, 5 minutes in we find out Cassie invents something in a basement that not even Hank Pym was able to do the past 30+ years- how? She read Hanks books. Glad that's all it take to be a Quantum genius! I'll get right to it. That's just one of the dues ex machina moments among a dozen. 
The other thing to talk about is Cassie's new rebellious spirit ala Falcon & Winter Soldier. Caring about others wasn't off base for her, but doing it behind her Dad's back was. They tried to recover her character from that rough start, but the damage was already done.
My last complaint is that, much like the recent Dr. Strange, our title characters seemed to take a back seat, or at least share the front. The movie struggles with a ‚Äòtoo many chefs in the kitchen' problem. Or maybe better, ‚Äòtoo many captains and not enough sailors.' You can't also have Janet and Cassie take lead roles and still have the necessary room for Antman and Wasp to own their title roles. There was never a prevailing narrative that our lead characters directed viewers towards. Sure, in the end, what needed to happen ultimately happened, but the ride was bumpy.

Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of moments of levity that show signs of the prior Antman films charm. Just don't go in thinking your getting an Antman film rather than a film that has Antman in it. When they took it away from our realm, the ruined any chance at building a meaningful connection with us as viewer through light-hearted relatable humor and well-placed nostalgia.

But you should definitely watch it. Because this is what the MCU has become, and this was the best they've done since the start of Phase 4 and it is probably the best you're gonna get."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure why this movie has such low ratings. It was good. Of course, there was overdone Marvel humor, but that is to be expected. Additionally, Darren's character was incredibly corny but other than those two issues, it was a standard Marvel movie. It wasn't GREAT but I don't think it was BAD by any means. Definitely way better than Eternals."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was definitely the best ant man film! It's a good lead up to the Kang film by introducing him into the MCU. I'm looking forward to seeing how the next films go within the MCU. Only bad thing about the film was the recast of Scott's daughter, I didn't like the actress and how they portrayed her in the film. Other than that it was a great film!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Siento que √∫ltimamente Marvel ha estado haciendo los guiones muy de prisa, sin ning√∫n sentido. Jonathan siendo el principal villano para la siguiente fase hace un buen papel, pero enfrent√°ndolo selo con Ant-Man es muy rid√≠culo. 
Es como si Star Lord en la primera pelicula de Guardianes de la Galaxia fuera el solo a enfrentarse a Thanos. 
La hija de Scott es muy simple en cuanto su actuaci√≥n.
Cada scena de la pelicula pareciera que lo hubiese escrito un ni√±o. 
Kang con tanto poder y mal desperdiciado. 
MORDOK hubiese sido el principal enemigo sin quitarse la mascara, y que la scena post cr√©dito presentaran a Kang como lo hicieron con Thanos en la Primera pelicula de los Vengadores. 
Pero ya que MARVEL STUDIOS es de Disney, lo est√°n empeorando poco a poco solo para ganar dinero, no le ponen ya el esfuerzo suficiente como antes. 
Las √∫nicas peliculas que he valorado despues de End Game es Wakanda Forever, y Spiderman Sin Regreso a  Casa."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics are wrong. This was a terrific Marvel film. The storyline was compelling and the visual effects were stunning. What critics may sometimes forget is that Marvel films are based on existing comic book stories and this film aligns well with the original source material. See it if you like super hero films.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are just tired of Marvel, I guess? I have no idea honestly because Ant man 3 was awesome. I very much enjoyed the entire movie. It was funny and action-packed."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,good story but drags towards the end
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had high hopes for it since it marks the start of Phase 5 of MCU. Despite its flaws and bugs, I really, really enjoyed the CGI feast,albeit the CGI for MODOK was a sore to the eye. Sorry Marvel for that. Now we talk about Kang. OH MY GOD KANG IS SO GOOD HERE. Jonathan Majors hitting home runs with his tiny but expressive emotions. Phase 5 is starting good and I'm waiting for the next few movies that will stretch the MCU new phase to a whole new level."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics missed on this one. They lack depth in understanding the multiverse and comics used as source material for this movie. Paul rudd's delivery made the entire theater laugh at moments comedic relief is needed. We see the best version of M.O.D.O.K. the screen has ever seen. Kathryn newton didn't really steal the show, but had nice father-daughter moments. Jonathan Majors.... really really really kills it... Job well done, and leaves you wanting more. The movie is heavy cgi, but what do you expect when exploring the quantum realm and explaining the multiverse. Very fun and action packed movie. Excited for this Kang saga! Happy to see my childhood come to life on the big screen!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing story and thrilling action scenes and eager to see how this goes.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's definitely not a perfect movie but it is quite enjoyable... especially the second half.The best part of the Movie is Jonathan Majors Kang üî•üî• It has some pacing issues and some bad CGI at moments but you will enjoy watching it. The only thing I didn't like in the movie is the character of Kathryn Newton i.e Cassie Lang. It felt like somebody has just put it her there.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was not as bad as people worked it up to be. I thought the plot was mostly good and it still had that signature Ant-man humor. Overall, a great way to start phase 5."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very good movie, with a lot going on from beginning to end. Amazing visuals effects."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved Kang as a villain. He was the strong point of this movie and made the stakes very high. I'm excited to see where things go. Cassie I thought was a weak point as an actress. I didn't feel the father-daughter chemistry.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Very nice movie with a few flaws. Very fun to watch
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It the good movie my dad say it 3 star but i think it 5 star
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics/haters.
Listen to the audience. This movie 
Was AWESOME!!! Great way to start the next phase. Johnathon Majors was AMAZING as Kang. Quite the range in his acting."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, worth seeing it in theaters, better then Love and thunder."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie to start phase 5 not to heart felt like Black Panther and not to overly comical like Thor 4, it was just the right amount of both. The only critic is that it should have been longer so they could emphasize more on Hope, because she felt like a secondary character."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The plot!! There wasn't much of one and way to much CGI. Characters that are uninteresting took most of the the screen time. Where was Rudd??
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Rotten tomatoes is so bad at rating movies I had to make an account just to let people know this movie is great has a little bit of everything people are looking for in a marvel movie there have been more than less mcu movies that would rank below Quantumania. Enjoy the movie
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Set up for Kanggggggggg
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors killed it as Kang. The rest of the performances were great as well.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I had fun watching it. Dont listen to the critics
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably someone up there decided that this movie shouldn't be successful but in my opinion it was excellent and I enjoyed it very much
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Great actors trapped in a poorly written CGI heavy mess. I like Marvel movies and this was a colossal disappointment.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the way movie sets up how Kang is going to be the next BIG BADDIE for the MCU.
The movie isn't perfect, there were rough spots but overall the movie does hold up and starts the Phase 5 with BANG."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are well off target with this one.
It's a fun entertaining movie... Is it infinity war???
No, but it is a fun movie and a great setup for the next two marvel phases.
Go watch and be entertained."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel has really fallen off.  After End Game Marvel actually ended. This Ant-Man was the worse one yet.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a solid movie and it finally feels like they are building towards something. Paul Rudd is great as always. He still gives Ant-Man that ""in over his head"" charm but you also get the sense that he is way more confident in his abilities. Kang takes a step towards filling the giant shoes that Thanos wore and I'm interested in seeing how Jonathan Majors pulls off what is coming."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2023!!!!!
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Another major disconnect between critics and movie goers. Critic scores are becoming useless.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed it. I don't get the hate it's getting. It was a solid, enjoyable Marvel movie. Good humour, great cast, decent story and plenty of action. I'd happily watch it again."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was so random and all over the place‚Ä¶ probably one of the worst marvel movies I‚Äôve watched
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Didnt actually mean to buy 3D tickets but it turned out great. If there is a marvel movie to watch in 3D its this one! Quantum realm is insane
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great and is a good introduction of Kang. Great opening for phase 5. Dont mind the critics' score. Lol
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie had everything a Ant-Man film needs. Lots of Humor, Shrinking, Growing and this movie adds a new aspect of insane mind tripping effects. Definitely the best mcu movie since nwh."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a movie that has the right to be a good start to phase 5 of marvel, but this movie has one minus, it's graphics... But this movie will definitely be liked by a fan of marvel."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I love Marvel.  Had to see the next one.   It was crazy good.   More of storyline to follow.   Kang was as scary as Thanos & seeing that it's more was incredible.   If you're a fan of Ant  Man... worth the price of admission
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie, it has some flaws but overall very entertaining"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Nice setup for the villain in the next couple of marvel movies and series. Quite fun dialogues and cool visual effects. Not as bad as everyone says it is.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good story with a great villain. This movie gives  the Ant-man team the right to be known as Avengers. A lot crammed into one film but all in all an enjoyable watch. And a great addition to Phase 4 of the MCU.

"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are hugely mistaken in rating this movie! It's what a marvel movie should be like! Pure marvel entertainment is back after an entire phase of movies which no one enjoyed! The multiverse saga has started making sense now & this movie brings MCU's new big baddie to light! All actors have given an amazing performance! The movie's completely enjoyable with great VFX, Story, Performances by all actors & everything else! Must watch!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well structured romp through the Quantum realm. Very enjoyable, great mixture of light and dark themes. 
Jonathon Majors is excellent as Kang with a delicious matter of fact menace about him. 
Kathryn Newton plays the idealistic gen zedder very well and is just the right side of annoying.
Rudd as always is brilliant. Only quibble would be that some of the humour misses the target usually the stuff from Michael Douglas.
Overall extremely enjoyable."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie that addresses many of the common complaints about mcu movies. It also leans into weird sci fi in a good way. Definitely recommend
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it. The layers within the movie, and how brilliantly the scenes transitioned and flowed together were so beautiful. Action scenes made quite the impact leaving me leaning forward from my seat. It's a solid film filled with a good blend of heart, suspense, and great cinematography. I think it's an excellent addition to the MCU, and is a great film for Antman films and comic readers. A wonderfully vivid micro to macrocosm of a film. Was definitely entertained, and excited for what's to come."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice date night movie with the hubby. We love Marvel hero movies.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a Marvel fan, I was pleasantly surprised and entertained again. The weirdness of the dialogue and the quantum realm was an interesting and Star Wars inspired experience. I think the unusual atmosphere was what made me fascinated the most about the movie and how it makes it really special."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie is probably the worst Marvel movie to date. The plot line is so obnoxiously pointless, characters being thrown into badassery with nothing to show for it, extremely bad dialogue, horrible character development for new characters (which means almost non) and troopers/villains who are weaker that 80 year old blind stormtroopers. the only reason I'm giving this 1 1/2 stars is because the middle part that includes a flashback builds up some good tension, but is utterly ruined about 10 minutes later. A horrible production, Marvel needs new writers."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love it, a refresher coming from disney+ shows that I have no interest in. The visuals were awesome, and the story was great. One thing that I heard, and I agree, is how easily they beat Kang. But I still really enjoyed it; it feels like a return to form"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"its good , i kinda enjoy it when i see it first time but when i rewatch it I saw some flaws but still movie kinda enjoyable and i totally recommend to saw it in cinema and also wait for post credit scene .those were awesome."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kang saved this movie, and even then the final battle felt rushed and the stakes didn‚Äôt seem to matter."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A good movie. The Quantum Realm is awesome, the VFX team has done the work greatly. Plot is awesome."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I usually take critic reviews with a grain of salt, however I have to say they weren't far from hitting the mark. Quantumania is just another in a long line of Marvel films that have barely touched the grandeur of its predecessors. It felt more like Spy Kids 3D."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Worth seeing for Kang, but that‚Äôs about it. Felt episodic, mostly served to set-up future movies and did very little else."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very good film, but its biggest flaw is that it lacks consequence. Scott and Hope coming back to Earth at the very end of the movie seems too easy to me. I think it would have been much better if they would have been stuck in the quantum realm. It could even have tied in better with Avengers 5, because if the Avengers need to go to the quantum dimension Scott and Hope are already there."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang!!!! Great entertaining performance
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie.. highly recommended
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,A family movie mostly for kids. Good storyline but gets dull after 30 mins.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was disappointed it didn't have the fun tone of the first two Antman movies.  It was too serious with too much fighting.  Also, the ending of the movie with the ants was way to contrived.  Just before watching the new movie, we watched the first two Antman movies on tv and enjoyed both movies with the humor and lightness of tone.  The new one was a big disappointment..  We certainly had no feeling of 'fun' when we left the theater."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Would have given it five stars but I think they might have taken out some key scenes that could have explained some things better and might have been needed for explain the MODOK character, but otherwise a very visual stunning film and Johnathan Majors was green in this film."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A lot of things happen, but there is no logic or reasoning behind any of it. I wasn't sure whether to feel embarrassed or insulted while watching it. Thank goodness for Paul Rudd being so charming because that's all this movie has going for it."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Way better than I expected!!
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was surprisingly fun. Jonathan Major's kills it as Kang the Conqueror and is by far the best part of the movie. M.O.D.O.K. was wasted and the ending was disappointing. Kang dies to Antman and his family which just makes him feel weak. However other than the ending and M.O.D.O.K. I thought the movie was a fun experience.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"An excellent introduction to Kang, or is that Kang's, for the next phase. I docked half a star as the necessity of making Kang a dangerous foe, lessened the usual comedy of an Antman & Wasp film. MODOK was done well,  but underused as well. I cannot wait to see more of Jonathan Majors brilliant actor. Not a perfect Marvel movie but another solid step forward for the MCU."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw the movie tonight. Went in hoping for the best and was rewarded. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Stellar cast pulling out solid performances. Jonathan Majors was outstanding and delivered an incredibly nuanced performance.  Kathryn Newton sparkled with everything we both love and love to hate about the newest generation. Paul and Micheal give the usual flawless performance and Michelle, well she's the closest thing to Janet Dyne that you've ever seen. Was it a bit cgi heavy? well considering that its hard to film in a place that doesn't match earth, no. And the vision they had was so well realized that I just sat and stared in wonder at times. oh and David Dastmalchian, almost stole the show.."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie was much better than the critics claim it to be. It was a great time and set up the next phase of the franchise.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely better than the previous two movies. Better actions, better villain and better supporting characters. Really fun to watch."

"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is a blast. A typical ant man adventure. He doesn't take him self seriously until the end. MODOK is hilarious, and tragic at some points. Also I remember reading some one was appalled at the nudity in any man. Spoiler it's ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. MODOKS naked bum lol and it's funny when it happens don't know how anyone could have been offended‚Ä¶ never mind. Anyways it's funny. Go see it! I promise you it's better than externals and love and thunder! Have fun!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"MCU continue their journey of worse quality movie.. predicted story line, childish screenplay, bad cgi... And very much predicted ending make this movie not just bad top 3 worst movie of MCU including shehulk, thor love thunder"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"There was a few issues with pacing, but the overall feeling leaving the theater was positive. A lot of story got introduced, and I felt it might have benefitted from a longer play time to flesh out the concepts."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely worth the watch. This new addition to the Ant Man movies helps round out the marvel universe and ties in/ clarifies multiple details of the multiverse, the quantum realm and the forthcoming timeline. Great visuals and great humor in between the plot. Would see again"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was great, more action and not as much humor as previous Ant-Man outings. But was terrific as a stand alone move or a cog in the whole MCU.  Kang will be a Thanos level threat, can't wait. 
Yes the Post Credit scenes are a must see and do a great job of setting us up for what is to come.
Paul Rudd was awesome as always.
  I am still missing the classic heros. But understand moving forward, we now have a whole gang of young Avengers. Now they need to be trained and battle tested for what is to come.
Come on K.E.V.I.N don't let us down."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"An ambitious entry into the Ant-Man franchise that's mostly bolstered up by its inventive new world, colorful visuals, creatures, set-pieces, and trippy sequences that does offer creative ideas however its does falter a bit in the world-building department as well as lacking the anchored character motivations shown specifically in the trailers that is strangely never expanded upon, though, is gilded with Jonathan Majors' regal and unhinged performance. Nuggets of ideas at the fingertips but doesn't go beyond initial drawing board concepts. Fun family kickoff to the summer that does breeze by."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Super fun and addicting!
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Watch Loki before going
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Gone are the days that Marvel should be proud of. This movie was an absolute train-wreck and desecration of the greatness Ant Man once was. I am sure had Scott Lang, Michael Douglas, and Evangeline Lilly not been tied into their contracts, they may have had some semblance of intelligence to run far far away from this one. Jokes were childish and the whole plot screamed of other material from other movies as well as it being ultra predictable!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If I never saw this movie I don't think it would have mattered, really forgettable movie. Kang actor did really good though on a positive note but not enough to make up for the rest of the movie which was lackluster. Who is writing these movies? Bring back old school Marvel."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too much sloppy cgi but a fun ride altogether.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was well done I love this movie a lot people say it's bad but it's really good
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Way Better Than a Bunch of Sub Par Crap These Last Couple of Years. Go Let Down Your Guard & Go Have Fun with Mr. Ant-Man. Maybe Eat a GUMMY Bear.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie lot of action and comedy
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,If this is a sign of things to come for marvel the future looks bright. Best ant man movie and. Best marvel movie in a hot second. It had its flaws but wow this was good
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,All the Super Hero movies seem to be the same.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Woulda been better if it ended more gravely but all in all I enjoyed the wacky yet tense sci fi feeling. Johnathan Majors is a stand out performer
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie all around.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. I loved the use of all 5 of the Ant-man family members. I thought the display of Ant-man powers was creative and new.  I thought Kang was great and the way they weaved Janet's story in with his.  MORDOK was great as well. I thought the effects were not over the top but used to enhance the film.  I don't know why people are giving this bad reviews. Much better than anything from Phase 4 (other than Dr Stange 2 and Wakanda Forever- those were great also).
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved everything about it! Amazing intro into Phase 5! I don't understand all the hate it's getting. I think people are too impatient. Few years later after more movies from phase 5 is released, that's when people will understand the concept of building the Multiverse Saga. People want things NOW! But chill out and enjoy the ride people!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,People hating on this movie dont realize that its a stepping stone to Secret Wars.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"No idea why the critics are holding the hate button on this one. We enjoyed this movie very much. I really hate all the ""news reports"" that are stuck on the Rotten Tomatoes 48%. The fans are digging this movie and rightfully so!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, critics are blind and deaf"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie that I have ever seen about comics universe, creepy creatures, Star Wars kinda copied universe, not related to hero movie at all, jokes are bad, not satisfied at all"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I reallly liked this movie. It was really fun, and the visuals were amazing. Everyone should see this movie."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Cool effects and a few good jokes. A little too predictable.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Just watch it for yourself I liked it a lot!
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,A really fun and fresh Marvel movie.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Much better than the last few movies and a great add to Kang‚Äôs characterization. Rudd nails Scott Land and Cassie Lang does an awesome job
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very fun, amazing visuals and a great cast."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Beyond the worst movie ever. Terrible writing, terrible acting. Weak plot. Snooze fest."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie felt like it's an intro and in-between to what's coming next for the MCU. Does it struggle in some parts? Yes. The comedy is a little forced, but I think the drama and plot gets the audience where it needs to be and to the next phase of the MCU. Don't believe the critics. This is a good movie. Watch it in IMAX."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, it's a boring movie, because the events as they unfold seem to have no direct connection. Then in this movie you copy from movies like John Carter, Star Wars, but the characters fail to involve you. And that's not counting the character disconnect with previous MCU films. Suffice to say I had to rewatch Morbius to forget about this film."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a thrilling and hilarious addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that will leave you wanting more. Directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Douglas, this movie takes the audience on a wild ride through the quantum realm with plenty of action and humor.

The film follows the return of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) as Ant-Man and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as The Wasp, as they team up with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hope's mother Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) to embark on a new adventure in the quantum realm. Along the way, they encounter new enemies, old friends, and some surprising twists and turns.

One of the best things about this movie is its humor. The banter between the characters is both witty and hilarious, with Paul Rudd's comedic timing shining through. The action scenes are also impressive, with the use of size-shifting powers creating some creative and visually stunning fights.

As the story progresses, the stakes get higher and the tension builds. The introduction of a new villain, Kang the Conqueror, adds an extra layer of excitement and intrigue. Jonathan Majors delivers a standout performance as the menacing villain, bringing depth and complexity to the character.

Overall, ""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a must-see for Marvel fans and action-comedy lovers alike. With its blend of humor, action, and excitement, it is a fun and entertaining addition to the franchise that leaves audiences eager for more."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"the movie was good, i think people dont like this new phase cause they really cant tell where its going or going in the direction they want. As a fan of stories and comics AND cinema this was DOPE"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Socialism is a heavy word..."" That line was enough for me to give this half a star"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,It had decent comedy . But it wasn't that exciting to me. I was definitely rooting more for Kang in this movie.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a great movie. It is underrated.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a great movie!  Kids all loved it.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,We saw it in 3D. It was really good! Very enjoyable
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,A movie to set up what is to come. Not bad.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan majors is AMAZING. Very excited to see more of him as Kang in the future. Lots of great action. The CGI looked a lot better than in recent marvel projects and I felt like it was a breath of fresh air from some of the weaker marvel shows lately.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was not interesting and the story line was awful.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"So refreshing to see an MCU movie in this phase that's so fun to watch. It's not deep, it's not full of much more than just pulpy content, but, man, what a fun ride! Full of creatures George Lucas only wished he created! Also refreshing that this doesn't seem to be pushing an agenda like so much of the new content in this universe. Just a fun watch that introduces a villain that actually looks scary enough to be the big baddie of the new multiverse."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mal√≠sima. Argumento pobre no, lo siguiente, los di√°logos no tienen impacto absoluto, los chistes son malos, el personaje Modok fue un intento de hacer algo gracioso pero no me re√≠ ni una sola vez. Final mega predecible, Kang es un personaje que no me gusta como villano, sin personalidad, sus motivaciones son predecibles y sin profundizar. Le doy un 5/10 por las batallas y efectos especiales que estuvieron buenos. Fui al cine a verla, no la recomiendo en cine, veanla cuando est√© disponible en otros lados, no vale la pena gastar 350 pesos para ver eso."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely better than the critic reviews suggest but not peak marvel overall good watch
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,It‚Äôs not like the regular Marvel but it is a good movie
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While Paul Rudd is still game and Jonathan Majors is a welcome new villain to the MCU‚Ä¶Ant-Man and Wasp: Quantumania lacks the fun and charm of the previous films, while also being an inconsistent mess of a marvel film."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang was easily defeated
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Best of the trilogy. Imaginative and bold
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Mostly fast paced fun. There are a few slow and cheesy moments and slightly jarring CGI. Overall it was a fun film. It did leave me wanting more, but as a build up to the following avengers film, it did it's job."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the humor in the movie. There were some really funny moments
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors is epic!
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Must pay attention to the dialogue because story is sometimes confusing. Ending was very simple.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,To much different type of alien scenery with fast talking to process.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,I C(an‚Äôt) man. Kang was good!
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esta s√∫per genial, me uviera gustado m√°s cameos pero la verdad est√° genial.‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,way better than the phony critics but not top 5 marvel
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man has been further Disneyed. Its made its way all the way down to Barney-like. And, its completely ripped off Star Wars Return of the Jedi."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fantastic! No complaints
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it. Nice to see Marvel finally addressing the next super villain and direction that the MCU will take.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'd give it a 4/5 Stars. The visuals are amazing, action sequences are great, typical Paul Rudd humour, the ensemble of actors works well together. John Major stole the show as, the new MCU villain. The Avengers are going to be in big trouble! What was lacking is the storyline and I   wanted and wished for  more depth to the story, but I'm thinking it's a good start to Phase 5 which is about opening now to the possibilities of what is to come and see what it unfolds. Overall, not a bad movie to enjoy watching as a family  ! My 6 year old loved it!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was an excellent expansion of the Ant-Man and the Wasp world and setup to Phase 5.  Kang is a phenomenal villain and I loved seeing Scott really get into Avenger-mode. 

The stakes were higher this go round so obviously there is going to be heavier moments but there was
still a lot of Ant-Man charm to go round.

Michelle Pfeiffer was flawless as usual.

My only real complaint is that Evangeline Lilly/Wasp was sorely underused.

But overall a fantastic addition to the MCU!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"They pretty much shortchanged MODOK but overall the movie was entertaining, immersive, and setup the state of Phase 5. Jonathan Majors is a force as Kang the Conqueror!! MCU, get ready!!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Entire family loved it. 10 to 54.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved it!!! I had such a blast, it was so enjoyable, funny and serious when it need to be. I love ALL the character developments and it feels like a complete trilogy!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was super disappointed with this movie. I didn't watch any trailers or ready any reviews before seeing it. It was so predictable and the acting was flat and boring. I love the comedy in Ant Man and was looking forward to the witty humor. There was some sorry attempts that fell completely flat. The most successful line got a pitty laugh from 2 people. 

There was a complete lack of supporting characters and the few there were I can't tell you their names or really why they were there in that scene. 

Like many other reviews it was Kang that somewhat saved the movie. But even with his amazing character the CGI and quantum realm in general was a total bust. 

I feel like I am not your hard core Marvel fan but I enjoy going and typically watch within the first two weeks of release. And I usually have a great time. This was just boring, loud, and weird."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie a bit predictable. but I ejoyed it ,fast paced"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good character development, humor without going overboard (like Thor), but the special effects guys took the story line hostage.  Very little plot and way too much Transformers-style action.  A video game junkie 8-year-old would like it a lot."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,lot of plot holes and stakes are nonsensical
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don't understand why Ant-man can't be the protagonist of his own movie and the OG Ant-man's wife did age while tiny?
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The plot line was great! And it‚Äôs really opening all the possibilities for the next Marvel movie line up.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun Marvel adventure. Nice return to the Ant-Man sagakps
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was Ok. Kang stole the show. Paul Rudd is always a blast
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was slow in the beginning but as the suspense kept building and the action kept rising it got better. I loved how Henry had kinda like a Tony Stark moment when he walked in with the ants. Another thing I absolutely loved was being introduced to this variant of Kang and getting an insight on his powers/capabilities. We are in for one hell of a ride when Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars come out.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"had good action, but it was too long and at times felt like I was watching a bad star wars movie. lacked the humor and heist action that made the previous two great."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Remember when Marvel films were fun? This was painful.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid movie! Enjoyable!
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Entretenida y llena de detalles en sus CGI del mundo cu√°ntico. Buenas actuaciones en general. Un poco agotadora la espera del por qu√© todos odian a Janet. No me convenci√≥ Modok, sobre todo el CGI, la calidad la sent√≠ como un JPG de baja calidad."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,O pior filme que a Marvel j√° fez.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"For some context, I have watch most Marvel Projects, haven't read the comics. The Critical reception for this movie is not indicative of the films general audience quality; it's one of the best MCU we've gotten in a while, the theatre was laughing throughout the film, the plot wasn't clever but had more of a reason to happen as a building block the whole of the MCU than other projects (MCU Shows excluding Loki, and certain Movies) It's superior to the previous two Antman films, similar pacing to ""Antman and The Wasp"" that being fairly solid and engaging."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The same thing as always, the strongest villain gets beaten by the power of love and family"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This is one of the best nonteam up movies we have had in a long time. Best ant-man movie so far.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania - A Marvel Must-See!

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania delivers a fun-filled and action-packed ride. With its engaging plot, strong performances, and stunning visuals, it is a must-see for both Marvel fans and moviegoers in general. It's a hit that will leave you eager for more adventures in the quantum realm."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Another marvel movie with great potential, one or two solid laughs and zero consequences"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie starts quick and that's not a complaint. The movie takes a little more serious tone with some humor you would expect from an Ant-man movie. Overall went in with average expectations and it passed expectations.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lost the humor of the first two movies.  Overstuffed with characters that could have been removed without damaging the story.  Tough to connect with anyone on the screen, but lots of weird ideas and CGI mayhem."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Explore a little bit more the new avengers formal: I enjoyed the fights. One issue I noticed is how Kang got rid of Ants. The art and visual effects are great. The stories made connections. Approved.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it was fantastic. There are a lot of Marvel films and TV shows that people should watch before they see this movie.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"NO SPOILERS- THIS IS A SAFE SPACE

I give this movie a 7.5/10. It is not NEARLY as bad as the critics say. I'd say if you are a Marvel fan, a sci-fi fan, you like weird, or all of the above, you should definitely give it a watch. But overall, it was pretty good! Basically, take Star Wars, Avatar, Loki, Thor: Ragnarok, Strange World, maybe sprinkle some Guardians of the Galaxy on there, add Marvel characters and you've got this movie. The best part of this movie is KANG. KANG CARRIED. OMG KANG IS AN ABSOLUTE POWERHOUSE OF A VILLAIN. Jonathan Majors is IRREPLACEABLE AS KANG. PERFECT casting. He is terrifying yet humble, calm yet rageful, and chill yet powerful. He steals the show EVERY SINGLE MOMENT he is on screen, Kang is an absolute BADASS. As for MODOK, oof, modok... um, yeah, MODOK was something, alright. He was just bad CGI and equally bad jokes. But MODOK has always been a pretty dumb character so I wouldn't expect anything more than dumb tbh. Also, Paul Rudd shines as Ant-Man as always, and he is just the same funny guy he's always been. Paul Rudd must be protected at all costs. Nobody could EVER replace him as Ant-Man. Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, and Michelle Pfieffer all delivered great performances in their roles as well! As for Cassie, NO. Recasting Cassie was THE WORST DECISION MARVEL HAS EVER MADE. I respect Kathryn Newton and am happy she got her big break, but, I mean, COME ON. You can't just fire a good actress AFTER she gets the part, not even bother to TELL her, let her find out via TWITTER, and replace her without even telling her. That's messed up. Also, no offense to Kathryn, but her lines were kinda cringe, and she didn't FEEL like Cassie, she wasn't HORRIBLE, she just... wasn't great. Again, no offense to Kathryn. Now, on to the visuals, CGI, and cinematography. The visuals are STUNNING. Marvel really bumped up their game on the CGI, there were a couple scenes where the green screen editing could've been better (i mean, during these few segments you can CLEARLY tell they were in a soundstage in Burbank), but overall, STUNNING. They brought the Quantum Realm to life with beautiful cinematography, CGI, and visuals. Beautiful. Except for MODOK, his CGI was a dumpster fire that I wish I could forget. But...alas... it is now burned into my memory. As for the soundtrack/score? The music/themes SLAP. Christophe Beck has knocked it out of the park again. There's a new version of the Ant-Man theme that plays during the end credits, and it will give you the CHILLS, it's such a masterpiece. You can probably find it on YouTube on the Marvel Music channel or on Spotify and iTunes, if you can, PLEASE do so, you will not regret it. Simply search ""Quantumania Theme"" and it should pop up. LISTEN. TO. IT. Anyway, this movie is EXTREMELY sci-fi, and one of Marvel's weirdest hits yet. If weird's your thing, like it is for me, you'll love it. But yeah, VERY sci-fi. 

Anyway, long story short, this movie didn't really feel like an Ant-Man movie, more like a true opening to Phase 5 and The Multiverse Saga. It answers a lot of questions about where the MCU is headed, and connects a lot of Phase 4 together, which I was a fan of. However, this movie could've done some more to live up to its FULL potential. But, I assume they're saving that for Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars. In conclusion, Kang and Ant-Man rule, MODOK and Cassie drool, the music is beautiful, I've already addedthe whole soundtrack album to my favorites on Spotify, and this movie is a huge sci-fi adventure that will have you on the edge of your seat. You should see it in a theater, it works better with immersive surround sound and a giant 4k screen in front of you. Plus, you get unparalleled popcorn. But it did have its flaws, but then again, every movie has its flaws, no movie is perfect, and no movie CAN be perfect. Except for Into the Spider-Verse, that masterpiece is flawless and unparalleled. Like MODOK and Cassie, they are HUGE flaws I'd rather forget.

But overall, pretty good movie! I give it a 7.5/10. Or a 75% on the tomatometer. It's not the greatest movie of all time, but it doesn't deserve a 47%. 65%-75% I think is what this movie deserves. It's a fun, sci-fi adventure with high stakes and an ASTONISHING final battle that will leave you questioning your existence. 

AND OMG, AS ALWAYS, STAY FOR THE POST-CREDITS. THERE ARE 2 POST-CREDIT SCENES AND THEY ARE MEGA-IMPORTANT. THEY HAD ME JUMPING OUT OF MY SEAT AND SCREAMING.

Thank you for coming to my TedTalk."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wanted to leave my first review as I don't think the movies hate from critics is justifiable. While not as grounded and more sci-fi then marvels earlier work; quanta mania is a fun gripping adventure. J majors whom is having a moment, is truly awesome and I am excited to see what's in store for this character. I think people are suffering from the super hero fatigue, but I'm not so go see it!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie, there was some plot wholes, however I want to see how it all connects together"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was an okay Marvel movie but it was full of a lot of cringe with Cassie and MODOK. Jonathan Majors is great as Kang.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Ant-Man movie in the franchise!!!!  The plot could of been a little more polished.  Nevertheless, the action was great, it was good family moments with the Ant-Man family and Kang.  KANG WAS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!  Jonathan Majors performance was amazing!!!!!  The real Avengers level threat is here!  Looking forward to this Multiverse Saga!  8.5/10"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,it was a winner for my 9 yr old and 17 yr old grandsons and for myself. Loved it!
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,A Great Looking Movie With Its Gorgeous Visuals And I'll Even Compare It To Star Wars. Jonathan Majors As Kang (CHEF'S KISS). But The Movie Fells Flat With A Messy Script And Underwhelming Story.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the latest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Douglas. The movie follows the adventures of Ant-Man, who teams up with the Wasp to explore the quantum realm and stop a new villain.

The writing in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is lacklustre, with a predictable and unengaging plot that fails to capture the imagination. The direction is uninspired, with lacklustre action scenes that fail to create any real sense of excitement. The performances are mostly mediocre, except for Michael Pena's Luis, who injects much-needed humour and energy into the film.

The cinematography is unremarkable, failing to create memorable images or striking visuals. Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a forgettable entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that fails to live up to the standard set by previous films in the franchise.

In summary, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a dull and forgettable film that fails to deliver on almost every level. Rating: 4/10."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie.  MODOK stole the show. Jonathan Major was fabulous.  Paul Rudd was great.  

Its a real comic book movie.   

Not sure what the critics saw."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'd give it a 6.5 or 7 out of ten. I really do feel like the critic rating is too low. It's not as good as the first two ant-man's. But the cast is great, it's funny and Kang is AWESOME!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, I was impressed by the creativity of the entire quantum world and everything we see in this movie is kinda fresh in the MCU, just shares few similarities with GOTG. I loved comedy in this movie, especially Paul Rudd's. Action and story is kinda fresh too. And the post credit scenes man!!! Damn!!! Can't wait to see what's coming!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was way better than I expected, amazing cast and hilariously funny!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I like that it kept me on my toes thinking what will happen next.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"We get all the effects and action we expect from Marvel. There wasn't a new idea to be found. No story beyond ""get the bad guy"". It was a loud, flashy bore after 20 or 30 minutes."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Nada de novo, uma aventura normal. Kang e M.O.D.O.K estavam muito bons. Foi divertido de assistir."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite being a little burned out on MCU and the superhero genre, everyone in my family enjoyed it. I subtracted 1 star for lack of development of new characters. In fairness, Marvel has plenty already. Family friendly, upbeat entertainment. No Hollyweird politics or pretentious artsy fartsy stuff."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing special effects. Pretty funny. Good story. Plenty of action. Paul Rudd is the man. The film is mesmerizing.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I had heard bad reviews going in but I have always liked Antman. I enjoyed the movie! It kept my attention and it was entertaining and exciting!
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved every bit of it. I don‚Äôt know why the score is it higher the movie had great cinematics, decent action and an OK storyline it wasn‚Äôt the greatest film of all time, but it was a great film, nevertheless"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie. A lot of action in it.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is entertaining. It builds on personalities from prior installments. Is it off the charts? No, but it is well worth the price of admission. Honestly, I am getting so sick of the pretentious and condescending critics on Rotten Tomatoes who desperately seem predisposed to wanting a Marvel movie fail. It was entertaining, advanced the larger story of the MCU. After the last couple of years it has become evident that the anointed ""critics"" of of Rotten Tomatoes need to get a grip and reign their egos back in. Not every movie needs to move us emotionally, spiritually, and carry a deeper implicit meaning. It can be as simple as, is it entertaining? Yes! Yes it is."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bad lines. Weird plot lines. Slow moments. Not Marvel worthy
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good movie. Cool special effects and characters
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Feels like I'm watching the first and second antman again. Kathryn Newton is the worst actress in the world. WTF was the floating head about??
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Plot was rushed. Not enough explanation of backstory of daughter.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a lot of fun, partly because it included a lot of fan service. That probably also makes it harder to enjoy for the casual audience member."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie is great for comic book nerds, but I can see why less comic-versed critics are saying they didn't get it. That being said, critics that don't follow the MCU should not have been reviewing this film."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely enjoyed this movie a lot! The main cast did a great job and Kang was a top tier villain who I cannot wait to see more of. The movie would have been better if it was longer to develop the relationships of the characters. Overall it was good and does not deserve the critic scores it‚Äôs getting. 
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,enjoyed the story and characters....time travel and multiverse elements open up lots of possibilities.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good 3d effects.  I didn't follow all the plot lines, especially what happened during the time Janet Van Dyne and Kang spent together.  Shouldn't she have aged more?"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,I thought it was good. It wasnt as good as the first two but still very enjoyable. I thought they tried to make it a little too strange. I thought the acting was good. The characters likable.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie had moments as well as lost opportunities. Lang's self talk at the end of the movie should have been cut
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining and a remarkable set up for the next phase of the MCU.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action and comedy, can‚Äôt wait to see more of Kang!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, 2nd act lagged a bit but it was overall entertaining, interesting and made me excited for the next chapter of the mcu."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lots of running n serious faces. Must have used left over stars wars set. Teenage sidekick...AGAIN..Disappointing. Could have been 30ms shorter
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great. Classic Ant-Man with the joke and sarcasm, introducing the next big villain. Filling in some gaps or question from Loki. It was awesome. Loved it!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,If you love CGI and bugs and maybe vegetables. 
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"the latest ant-man adventure delivers a visually stunning, very exciting adventure, but it doesn't have the same feel as the other ant-man movies, san francisco has a very short amount of time on screen and there's also the surprising exclusion of several important charecters from previous films, it's still pretty good though."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I enjoyed the acting from Majors, but how Kang was portrayed was almost laughable at the end. No real stakes. Even threatening more Kangs didn't mean much since Kang just lost a 1 on 1 with Antman"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,O filme √© incr√≠vel pois nos apresenta o universo qu√¢ntico. E aos mesmo tempo o filme nos d√° uma ponta de como tudo isso vai se amarrar ao multiverso que est√° sendo apresentado desde homem Aranha. Al√©m disso o filme √© uma grande a√ß√£o em fam√≠lia ao mesmo tempo que vem construindo camadas de um vil√£o que est√° por toda a linha temporal.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Our kids had a great time. The jokes landed. The quantum realm was really cool & felt really rich & lived in. We're really excited to see more.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman returns in his witty, nonchalant and protective daddy fashion in the MCUs latest installment of the Antman franchise.  Paul Rudd hasn't aged but Evageline Lilly with the short hair looks like she could literally be his older sister. The jokes are ok, the visual effects are stunning, especially the quantam creatures and realm. Cassie is so-so, not the same actress from Endgame, the recasting is understandable, not sure if she was a great fit as film progressed, but like her or not she is destined for her own spinoff.   A rewritten Modok and Kang stole the day for me and saved the film. Be sure to watch all of Loki on Disney if you don't follow comics because you might get lost in Quantamania's plot otherwise. This film is less of an Antman movie and more of a setup for the next phase in the MCU, Antman like Dr. Strange continue to be the  fabric holding the multiversal bigger blankets together.  I did not roll into the theater with high expectations as a Marvel fan, but left pleasantly content and excited to see who Kang and his multiversal selves go after next."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,best marvel related thing ive seen in a while
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Action throughout with moments of humor added in.   Really enjoyed the experience.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice movie. I expected less but I was mind blown.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good fun, not like 1 or 2 of antman but sets up future marvel and avengers movies"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan majors is the goat ong
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it very much. It had a great cast, with adventure and humor."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good movie. Good dialogue. Wait til all the credits are ran, there is a bonus clip"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watched this after working night shift,. Normally I‚Äôll just sleep in. Can‚Äôt say no to my son who really like to see it. Never slept, probably closed my eyes for 5 minutes but I‚Äôm still awake. For me, it‚Äôs very entertaining. My son liked it too, very much he said."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,It lives up to the expectations.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worse than Open Water. Possibly worse than The Eternals. I'd rather fold laundry for two hours than watch this movie.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It wasn't the worst thing Marvel has made lately but it definitely was not good. I'm wondering what theaters were showing the version where Jonathan Masters was so ridiculously amazing. He was great at the end for about 3 minutes when he had no powers but other than that he had very low charisma and he doesn't inspire gravitas like Brolin did for Thanos... is going to he another Ben Kingsley/Trevor Slattery/Mandarin joke? Ultron was a better villain. 
Shouldn't have been called Ant-Man & Wasp should have been called Ant-Man's daughter & Wasp's mom. 
This is just another installment of the MSheU where all characters are being transitioned to female. But it doesn't work. 
And the entire MODOK arc was horrible. Sadly Marvel found a worse ending to a feud than DCU did with Batman v Superman (our moms have the same name?!). They solved it with ""Don't be a d!ck!"" LAME.
Actually the more I think about it yes this movie was bad."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a fun adventure that definitely it's not for all tastes, nevertheless MCU fans will definitely enjoy it. A step in the right direction for phase 5"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While Quantumania does require you to do your homework, and some characters do not work as well as others (Lord Krylar, Wasp), the overall story makes for a good Ant-Man movie. Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors shine in their respective roles, Kathryn Newton sets up Cassie as a new fan favorite, and Michelle Pfeiffer brings a new level of depth to Janet Van Dyne."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie! To each their own, I suppose."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was my favorite Antman movie. Loved the special effects/other world building. The cast was fantastic and there was just enough laughs to keep it Marvel but not so much that its annoying. Well done, Marvel! Cant wait to see more!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie, we really enjoyed it!!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great. Kang will be dominating the MCU for a while and this movie introduced him well. I believe Marvel did a good job introducing Kang for those who never read the comics or watched the ""Loki"" series.. Paul Rudd humour was just on point, no wonder why everyone loves him. Jonathan Majors, just brilliant. Can't wait for what's coming up next"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the story line.  The visuals, creatures and species that were in the quantum world were quirky but clever.  It was very entertaining and we enjoyed the show."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,The final battle with kang and his powers are crazy
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a good movie if you can past 2 things.  1 - The mom Janet keep those secrets.  2 - Kang keeping those secrets.  If you saw the movie you know what I mean.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Kang was awesome, Paul Rudd was awesome as usual...the rest, decent. There was a lot of fat here that could've been trimmed. It was decent, but it could've been great."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film is boring,"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not as good as the original Ant Man movie.  The plot seemed a bit forced to me but it was an okay movie.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"For CGI fans, it's a bonanza, but for people who like their movies to have a coherent plot, it's a total failure. Lots of noise and color, and nothing even vaguely human about the characters with which to relate. Definitely at the bottom of the heap of the Marvel entries. If they don't get their narrative powers back, the whole franchise is in danger of deflating."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The pros of the movie were in my opinion is that the story wasn't that slow, it was engaging most of the time, and the fighting parts were not that but. For the cons I will say the comity was very corny most of the time, and the CGI was slightly bad most of the time. Over all the movie was fine."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Completely boring and non-threatening villain. Ant-Man films have always been a light hearted  ride filled with humor and warmth. That's all gone in this waste of two hours. The final words in the screen were, ""Kang Will Return"". My response, ""Who Cares?"""
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Seemed like a bootleg Star Wars movie
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,it was like reading a comic book
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It won't blow you away, but it does the basic thing you want from a Marvel movie: it gives you a good time. I think all of the main cast does a great job, including Johnathan Majors, who puts his all into Kang. I also think the movie does a better job of balancing humor with more dramatic character moments. It's fun!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked everything about it except for how kang dies and doesn‚Äôt really show how strong he is.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,cheese is yummy because the flavour just really makes me happy and delighted.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the movie was good. It had a few bumps in the beginning, but the cgi looked amazing. Kang helped make the movie even better by being an amazing villain."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"To me, it was good for an Ant man movie, probably one of the best out of all of them, and that's how you have to look at it"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was missing the best parts of the Ant- Man series, by that I mean Ant-Mans crew, the story was flat, and the jokes didnt land"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terribly boring, and humor reached a new low for Marvel."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"good, not great. visually amazing. but the story was choppy due to editing cuts. you can tell things were left out"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Johnathan Majors crushes it as Kang and I‚Äôm excited to see him in more MCU films as the big bad. This movie to me finally gave Antman that jump to true super hero status and not just a funny side character amongst the Avengers.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good continuation of the storyline.  Oodles of action, some heartfelt emotion and also humor."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,i enjoyed ant-man and the wasp  i felt it was a great setup for the kang the conquer trilology
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Visual effects < story (yeah no this movie is bad)
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Thoroughly entertaining!
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"√â um filme com conte√∫do fraco, e novamente com ""vil√µes"" (e em alguns aspectos her√≥is) nerfados, s√≥ mais um filme pra completar a linha do tempo Marvel, um filme que s√≥ serve para dar √™nfase aos pr√≥ximos filmes, um filme feito para dar continuidade, e novamente um filme para finalizar com um ""vil√£o"", para que outro entre no lugar. Um filme esquec√≠vel."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was fantastic, lots of action, some levity, good storyline, great acting!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was‚Ä¶a Marvel movie. They're all pretty much the same at this point. Thought that the standout in this one would for sure be Jonathan Majors but his acting suffers at the hands of the script. Surprisingly, Kathryn Newton was the standout lead in this one. Can't wait to see her in more projects"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Janet having questions all while saying the best lines in the movie is great. Whole timelines I love that it‚Äôs amazing. Well lit actors cinematography was taken over the top. Beautiful story to start the spring. 
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"They did the marvel thing where they put in some annoying characters and couldn't commit to action or comedy, sometimes marvel finds a good balance but the jokes fell flat more often than not and failed to take itself serious to often. Characters made out of pocket nonsensical decisions with a few being borderline character assassination. 5/10 worth watching in theaters but will never rewatch."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's pretty good the only issue is everyone expecting and giving it bad reviews because there so used to Thor, captain America hulk etc making everything so huge there the biggest mcu actors compare to antman. I give this movie a solid 10/10"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,An enjoyable mcu movie!!!
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie. Enjoyable.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics are crazy. This was really good..would be 5 stars if it weren't for modok
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exciting, humorous & entertaining.  Great actors."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. Story pulled me in and kept me until the last scene.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a really good movie. I read a lot of hate and after watching it I can't understand why. It is the best Marvel movie in a long time. The highlight of the movie is a scene that shows dispite Scott's shortcomimgs jis love for his daughter transcends the multiverse. He may be Earth's tiniest hero but he may also be Earth's best dad.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I think my score is indicative that I had low expectations because of critic reviews prior to going but enjoyed the movie while keeping in mind the importance of the story in future films. Also my kids enjoyed it so that elevated my opinion.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Some of the effects aren't done well and that is the major drawback. Johnathan Majors is awesome & the movie is an introduction to the next major villain for those who don't watch the TV shows.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked this movie especially when Cassie Lang wanted to fight and was giant
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Only think that was awesome was Kang, the rest like the relationship between antman and wasp didn't get me because was not developed enough to impact us in the end(which makes the scene in the end stupid).
MODOK was a joke(it was very bad) and the fact in the end to appear a portal from no where in the end takes out the rush from the movie and the kang disapeared like that it makes the vilain worthless. To summarize it was a movie for child and I regreted to watched it."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Thought itd be boring. It wasnt!
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is entertaining and very light-hearted, it's not as the critics are claiming it to be."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Es una buena pel√≠cula, pero algunas tramas no est√°n muy bien usadas, tiene un humor bueno aunque un poco hueco, pero si es una buena pel√≠cula. Te recomiendo verla."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is not perfect. In my opinion, it was intentionally created for the fans and people who just want to go out with friends and family to relax. The story is simple, not complicated, the flow is smooth and not boring. Action packed and CGI is on point. The creative way to create a new world/universe/environment was genius. You'll vibe a Starwars/Startrek but this is still a Marvel movie so you'll know it's a Marvel.

I recommend this movie and I would still watch this despite watching this twice already.

Don't hate, just enjoy. Not everything needs to be complicated."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Only good thing in film was Michelle Pfeiffer.  Not enough story.  A lot of wasted time on action sequences that left me numb.  Visuals were plastic in nature and cluttered, with no sense of simplicity and beauty."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Must see in 3D. Great graphics. All star cast. Solid story line.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just one confusing escape after another.  Story didn't hold together well. Special effects were OK.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie should just be called kang
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Weird and way too much CGI.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Whereas previous installments of this ""little"" corner of the MCU gave Ant-Man and the Wasp more earthly pursuits, Quantumania ups the ""ant""e as far as their importance to the overall saga. Paul Rudd shines in his usual way, but this time with a more serious side as the Dad wanting to protect a daughter who ends up not needing much protecting. If her disappointment in his current activities at the beginning of the film seems forced upon Kathryn Newton's Cassie, the actress is given more nuance later as a burgeoning hero truly inspired by her father. Unfortunately, the development of Cassie's character leaves little room for Evangeline Lilly's Hope to do anything more than be in the nick of time. A gaping hole from previous films is rectified here with an interesting backstory for Michelle Pheiffer's Janet, and she and Michael Douglas unsurprisingly shine here. As for Jonathan Majors, the sky's the limit...the power, menace and anger he projects slide like quicksilver in a winning performance. As for other characters, the leaders of the rebellion could have used more time and longtime Marvel fans were probably hoping for appearance by the rights-locked Micronauts to make them more interesting. Some fun cameos and the unexpected return of an old fiend were enjoyable as well. All in all, a quality installment of the MCU."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent from start to finish.  Looking forward to the sequel.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw it in IMAX3D. Was worried by all the negative press leading up to my showing, but it was a very fun movie. My wife and I enjoyed it tremendously."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Marvel did star war movie better than a Star Wars movie. Kang is so villainous!! Ant-Man and Wasp Quantumnia is awesome. Marvel did it again! Screw the damn critics
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie Is awesome Kang Is Great villan Is The Future Of The mcu The fun Is 7/10 In this movie The incorporation Of Cassie Of The Ant-Man team Is incredible Is time for waiting Avengers The Kang Dynasty
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Why do people hate it so much?
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I missed Luis (Michael Pe√±a)!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,That was a fun ride! Loved Kang. Looking forward to more encounters with the Conqueror.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just as good as the first one, the only problem is that they forgot to give us a update to luis other rhan that it's amazing and can't wait for the future of phase 5. Modok is the best Avenger."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a typical ant -man movie
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,great ant man movie. great setup for phase 5
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just a feel good movie, the good guys won (we think) and the guy got the girl.... Dad let his daughter know how much he loves her.  Lots of not your every day characters. And everyone can find a reason to like ants."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If nothing else, this movie held my attention. It definitely feels like the setup, as opposed to the star of Phase 5. Kang is just getting started."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was great.  First movie to move the over all plot forward in a bit.  It was way better than thor 4 and black panther 2.  I would recommend
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The first Ant-Man was one of my favorites in the MCU, the second was disappointing but no biggie... this was really a disaster to point of almost ruining my enjoyment of the original"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is fun‚Ä¶kind of like lost in Space. A family in a strange land working together(like ants) to survive. I liked that the Dad/daughter relationship hit the typical teenage struggles, and gave them an arc to work through. Majors is great. I can't wait to see more of that guy(Creed 3)! Film is a good time, and Paul Rudd is as loveable as ever."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't understand all the bad critic reviews this might be the best marvel movie since Spider-Man no way home
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Es un buen inicio de Fase, tiene una buena trama, buenos personajes, escenarios, efectos, etc...
Acaso ¬ønadie recuerda el inicio de la Fase 2 con el fiasco de Iron-Man 3?
Scott es un buen personaje, con un desarrollo excelente desde su debut, le cae bien al publico y se hace entra√±able.
Tenemos villanos muy buenos, se presenta a Kang por primera vez (en un film) y realmente es una amenaza, su origen o motivaci√≥n son convincentes y f√°ciles de entender, sobre todo para el publico general o los cr√≠ticos que no saben una mierda y solo critican y odian las pel√≠culas de acci√≥n y/o CiFi por que eso ""aumenta su prestigio"" o algo as√≠...
La pel√≠cula es buena, se pasa muy r√°pido y estas en todo momento dentro del film, siendo lo √∫nico malo seg√∫n mi ignorante opini√≥n, el 3er acto y el final.
S√© y sabemos que este Kang (Conquistador) no estaba en su m√°ximo nivel, pero aun as√≠ se sinti√≥ nerfeado por el bien de la trama, cosa que pas√≥ desapercibida por las escenas post-creditos que nos emocionaron a m√°s no poder, sobre todo a nosotros, los fans, que ya conoc√≠amos el consejo de los Kangs y a Victor Timely.
Cassie Lang, Stinger, me gust√≥ bastante en las manos de Kathryn Newton, pero en momentos la sent√≠ muy ""simple"" por decirlo as√≠, sin alma, una actitud muy plana en mi opini√≥n, s√© que es su primera aparici√≥n protag√≥nica, pero me hubiera agradado m√°s que hicieran m√°s interesante su personaje, para encari√±arnos m√°s, engancharnos y querer saber m√°s y m√°s sobre Stinger, como lo hicieron con Scott en Ant-Man 1. 
Tambi√©n algo que no me gust√≥ nada, fue la poca relevancia que le dieron a Wasp en esta pel√≠cula, ella tiene un potencial enorme, que al parecer no han sabido aprovechar a√∫n‚Ä¶ espero lo hagan pronto, el tiempo no es eterno.
Y por ultimo, lo probablemente m√°s criticado de la pelicula, M.O.D.O.K., muchos dicen que est√° mal hecho, que da cringe, que lo arruinaron completamente y fue un total desperdicio, pero para mi, Darren Cross fue un M.O.D.O.K. bueno, le cambiaron su historia de origen, pero no es nada por lo que debemos preocuparnos, al ya estar muerto... MUERTO, ¬øC√ìMO VAN A MATAR A M.O.D.O.K EN SU PRIMERA APARICION EN EL MCU!??, literalmente fue la peor decisi√≥n de Marvel y Disney en esta pel√≠cula, ¬øno era MUCHO mejor dejarlo escapar del reino cu√°ntico para seguir aprovech√°ndolo en historias como, young avengers????, su muerte realmente me descoloco y he de decir que sus √∫ltimos momentos si me hicieron sentir algo inc√≥modo, pero el personaje no fue arruinado... solo fue desaprovechado... otro m√°s para la lista"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good start to Phase 5 of the MCU.  Didn't drag on and didn't feel too short.  I loved the twists and the ending! Everything fit well aside from Bill Murray. it's more of a cameo role than anything else. 
make sure to stay for mid and post credits scenes!
---(spoilers below)---

 Interesting take on MODOK.  Didn't see it being him... I would have liked to see more of Janet's powers. Kang is similar to his variant from the end of Loki season 1. Though what is meant to be menacing or manipulative, kind of comes across as flat in places.   just like Janet, Hank was under used until the end.  These are just not picking on my part, but I genuinely loved this one!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome graphics, the cast was phenomenal!  We really enjoyed the script!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The storyline is good although feeling kinda down because lately, the marvel universe has been depressing. when are we going to have finales that have the audience cheering."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was good.  Beginning felt like I was watching a Star Wars Movie.  Loved the last snip-it with Loki.  Makes me want to see Loki in next Antman Movie.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Shockingly surprised. Great from start to finish.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great comeback setup for the MCU. Enjoyed every bit of it. Can't wait for what's to come next
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Poor attempt at star wars copy. Very disappointed.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Script writers still doing the, "" There's no time to explain."" Nonsense. Take 2 min for an info dump. Other than that this was a fun flick."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not as bad as everyone says it is it was honestly just a good and solid movie and I can't wait to see more Kang
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel is in trouble. They haven't made a good movie in quite sometime
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie and great snacks :)
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The future of the MCU is looking great!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It moved very fast, and could have slowed down and utilized it characters better. But overall enjoyable."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another Great Marvel movie, can't wait for the next!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing!!! I went to see it 3 days ago with low expectations from the reviews, but me and my family were so surprised! It was an amazing movie from beginning to end. Critics say they got tired of the quantum realm in the first 10 minutes, I wanted to see more! It was spooky, mysterious and beautiful and the cast was awesome! Though I have to say the wasp could of been better but everything else was perfect and the villain kang was awesome so was MODOK and ant man was well, ant man (super cool). This movie was a 10/10 must watch worth to see in theatres  (Don't listen to the critics)"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was fine Kang was good everything else was just meh. The hate the movie is getting is not deserved but it's definitely not a GREAT movie.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This one was better than the first two Ant-Man movies. Quantumania was more like Ant-Man and Wasp visit Star Wars. However, this time around the movie seemed more like a MC movie. The last sneak peek is great, so stay to watch it!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I loved Kang but that's about it honestly. Some of the acting fell flat. There was too much CGI but that's kinda understandable. It wasn't funny at all and finally MODOK that's all ima say
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the movie it was good
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great best marvel film since no way home
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was good but not the greatest marvel movie
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lots of action and many stars that I was not familiar with
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A standard silly sci-fi movie. It had some interesting premises and a great showing by Jonathan Majors, but a lot of things didn't make any sense (as admitted by the movie itself) and much of it was paint-by-numbers."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely hilarious we laughed till we cried.the action scenes were awesome as well
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lackluster and lacked a plot
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was really good. While I agree the arc of Scott could of been more closely examined and wasp should of been in the movie more, but I still greatly enjoyed this movie. Kang was brilliant in this movie, I really liked his performance. The start of the movie was a bit messy, and they should of had another 5 or 10 mins extra on earth, in my opinion, but everything else I really enjoyed. Overall I would recomend people to go see this movie! However, I know some people absolutely hate the movie which I understand. So my advice is, if you feel the fatigue of marvel, and are not liking their more recent movies, then I don't think this movie will change how you feel. Overall I wouldn't mind watching this film again!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Let's not take everything too seriously. A wildly colorful 80s sci-fi style movie isn't for everyone. Witty without a constant stream of jokes, just naturally humourous characters contradicted and even put in their place by a villain that doesn't even take the time to lower himself by acknowledging anything outside of goals. Marvel reminds that scripts need empty space and Kang speaks just as much with his facial expressions as he does with his lines. It's not a romance. It's barely a super hero movie. It's a family of fighters on a space/time adventure that they barely make it home from and did they even defeat the big bad (or was he sucked into avoid in a similar way to MODOK?)"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing, the storyline, not too many plot holes, the acting was all top-notch, the critics absolutely got it wrong. They don't even know what's good movies are anymore, this movie was a five out of five, my girlfriend is not a big movie person, absolutely loved it as well. You can actually follow along with everything that's going on."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"baller movie, enough scenes with big antman for me :))"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think people who didn't like this movie were expecting something like Endgame or something, I understand what could have been better but still think its a good movie"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,ENOUGH!!! I think that Marvel and myself need to take a LONG break. The 1/2 star is because I had to leave a rating. 
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it had clunky CGI, some really bad lines but fun overall. Best part was Kang, Looking forward to Kang Dynasty"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The multiverse was never explained, forced jokes, Kang was not menacing, Hank Pym was only around for comic relief, the Casey Lang character was nothing like the Endgame version of the character and what in the world was M.O.D.O.K.?"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,too much going on with not much of an actual story.. just characters doing things just because
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it, I thought it was a great movie a lot of action. I think compared to the other Ant-Man movies this one ranks in the top."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,A great movie for Marvel fans and a great performance of Kang
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this was really fun. I sincerely loved this movie and will be seeing it again.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Trippy fun time! It no Endgame but nothing else is so get over it already.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this was a great movie that sets up the MCU for years to come
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it..... This movie was fantastic definitely buying it on blu ray when it becomes available
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know what these critics are smoking but this movie was incredible. The CGI and the complete imagination of the writers and the visual artist on an entirely new world was epic.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie and great action scenes!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow, that's four straight disappointing Marvel movies, all of them since No Way Home. In spite of their great (and mostly successful) effort to create a spectacular world, the movie managed to be uninteresting. The dialogue was stiff and amateurish (MODOK's miraculous and sudden change of heart, really?), which is weird considering Marvel's track record of better-than-expected screenplays. I don't know if Feige and crew have run out of gas, the multiverse just doesn't foster engaging storylines (though Loki was really good), or their emphasis on EID is hamstringing their creativity, but aside from a couple of the TV series, Marvel is in a downward spiral. Here's hoping Secret Wars and/or Guardians 3 proves this MCU fan wrong."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It had action and it was funny too.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,RT got it wrong on this movie. this was a very fun and enjoyable movie. A bit by the #'s but definitely better than the reviews its getting.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Divertido, emocionante e cativante. A fam√≠lia formiga cresceu e os desafios tamb√©m, esclareceu muita coisa em rela√ß√£o ao multiverso e ao universo qu√¢ntico."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Goes to show critics don't know a thing about good movies this movie was hilarious, serious when needed, an overall joy to watch I'm not a huge fan of the antman trilogy but this movie is the best by far and a great introduction to kang must see modok takes some getting used to tho"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great! The theater still pisses me off though.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid addition to the MCU. Not a lot of new ground broken, but unless you're a no-talent critic who is tired of watching films because you're hoping for the re-invention of the wheel in every new movie, you'll be happy that Feige and crew still know how to make an entertaining family friendly action packed movie with just enough wit and character development to not be a DC movie:)-  CGI was fine and storytelling was fine. People need to ask themselves: Could I do better? If the answer's no, be happy they keep pumping out solid movies for just about all audiences to enjoy.  #firstworldproblems right?!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like the Marvel movies. Ant Man is a fun character. Though the movie was predictable, I still liked it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Exciting and so much fun. Gorgeous depiction of the Quantum Realm and beautiful special effects. See it on the big screen!!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,There was a lot of action but I think it was a little bit drawn out
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The stakes have never been lower with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. A film that did not know whether it wanted to be a comedy suitable for PBS Kids, or a serious film setting up Marvel's next big bad. Every serious moment has been turned into a joke for a cheap laugh. There are extremely cringy moments reminiscent of Thor: Love and Thunder throughout, and the rebellion are a completely uninteresting bunch of characters. Kang the Conqueror is reduced to a typical Saturday night villain. For someone who is supposed to be 'worse than Thanos,' he did absolutely nothing to intimidate. A horrible waste of characters and acting talent. This needs to be Marvel's wake-up call or they will be in big trouble."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,CGI was very realistic and did not seem to follow the usual over played tropes. Each of the story arcs meshed together well by the end.  Finally the intergenerational dialog was amusing and timely.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Whilst the critics are suffering from Marvel fatigue the audiences are not. A fun movie with all the comedy wit of the first two. Not a stone cold classic but good fun. And funny. And a great promise of Kangs to come. Wildly inventive creatures too.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was simply not good.  Even the costumes were weak.  The only amusing parts were the beginning and the end when Paul Rudd walks down the street to ""Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back.""  What a shame."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Liked that it was full of action, very colorful and appropriate for my 6 & 9 year old grandkids. They really enjoyed the movie. However, there was some swearing throughout the movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome. Exactly what I expected going in. Much larger than the first two movies which was nice change as we don't want to see the same thing three times. Kang was excellent. MODOK I don't know much about the comic character but really enjoyed what they did with him in this movie really funny. Only disappointment was the missing ex con crew for me.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought that it was a great movie to watch! Kang was a really cool and well written villain for the movie but there were times that he almost died that was a little ridiculous. The only other thing is that the acting for Ant man's daughter might need a little help. Other than that, I think you should definitely watch it!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed the movie. I think it was the perfect ballance between silly, while still staying on the path of being a great super hero movie. Context to new viewers was provided, and it was nice to see the creativity the Marvel team put into the new world, ""The Quantum Realm""!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very well done.  Great casting and effects.  As usual, the critics are idiots"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, must watch #no spoilerü§Øüî•üòé"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Found it boring lacking stakes and everything here has been done better in other marvel movies. The final battle at the end was very lackluster. The visuals were cool but a pretty world can't save a boring script and cringy pg13 dad jokes.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I was a new MCU acolyte for The Infinity Saga. I was not a comic reader so I only had a cursory knowledge of the heroes. I hadn't seen most of the MCU movies and didn't learn all those movies were connected until Black Panther and Infinity War were coming out. I took an interest and so I got to binge and rewatch and study and dive into 20+ movies within just a years time. It was intense and loads of fun. But now with the Multiverse Saga it FEELS like Marvel is just slow rolling these ""episodes"" little by little because I've gotta wait and wait and wait when before I got to watch and watch and watch. 

All that said, if you're an MCU junkie like me, Quantamania is required viewing. If you're not, it's enough to keep you entertained, but I wouldn't make a special trip. It's less humor and more intensity and action than the previous two Ant-Man movies. But the whole crew (Scott, Hank, Janet, Hope, and even the new Cassie) all feel very familiar. Maybe TOO familiar‚Ä¶ maybe a little boring. I didn't hate it. It was interesting visually and conceptually and kept my attention for the most part. But there weren't any all caps WOW moments for me. Multiverse of Madness made me yell out foul language bunches of times. <HOLY SHOT!!! WHAT THE FLOCK!!!> Quantamania was more like lower case PG cuss words. Dang. Hell. Fiddlesticks. Anyway, if you're an MCU fan, go see it in theatres for the visuals and captive audience experience. If you're just a movie goer, it's not a must see. It's fun. But not $10 tickets and $15 popcorn fun."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Probably one of the worst of the Avenger films. Poorly written, and too reliant on being set in a virtual world with ridiculous characters. Marvel needs to do a reboot."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,So the wife and I liked this a lot.  I'd give it 5 stars however this multi-verse thing keeps coming up in all the Marvel stuff and we are growing tired of it.  The action is great and the cgi is better than ever.  The speed of shrink/grow time is really fast on the main characters.  The new villan is a very powerful character.  If you are into Marvel this is a must see.....
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel has become formulaic‚Ä¶
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a standalone movie, it was great. But when you remember the past two Ant-Man movies, you think about Paul Rudd, a truly funny guy and character as Ant-man, this movie really failed to have the humor of the previous two. Without spoiling things, I think the ending was also pretty lackluster as well."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Antman is one of the most boring heroes in the MCU. A hero without abilities, who only becomes a hero with a suit that he didn't even design himself. Disney has already proven with part 1 that you can only make a mediocre, boring movie with such a hero. Why Disney wants to prove that they can surpass boredom with every other movie will remain a mystery to mankind."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bom filme, nada de espetacular. 
Kang deste filme muito fraco espero que melhore."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm not a Ant Man Fan. But this was a pretty GOOD DANG MOVIE!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The CGI was amazing as usual. Majors saved the movie and kept you somewhat interested. Ant-man and friends were all very un-interesting, their dialogue seemed like it was written for kids. Being an Ant-man & Wasp movie you saw very little of either one of them. The movie was tolerable, but I wouldn't recommend it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this movie is great and the best of the Ant-Man films. Kang was great (who I'm sure is not dead) and it was very entertaining and exciting.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,The Marvel experience is declining. We keep giving it excuses because of how good they use to be. These movies meant a lot to me growing up and now I can't help but to be disappointed of what they've become.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Disney is saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok kids, you can talk back to your parents and not have to listen to their rules‚Äù. Oh, and the homeless problem in CALIFORNIA is someone else‚Äôs fault, not the local government. "
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Story felt like they just skipped a few scenes for no reason, so the pacing is kinda weird, also the dialogue is awkward at times and a bit gringe, the cgi and the visuals are interesting, not exactly bad but still... In overall it is a very fun movie, considerably better than the second installment and almost as good as the first. I had a blast watching it and I would watch it again given the opportunity."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure why the critics are being harsh on this one.  I saw it and really enjoyed it.  One of the better MCU movies I've seen in a while.
Of the recent ""Phase IV"" of the MCU, I was okay with Black Widow, really like Shang-Chi and had a great time with Spiderman: NWH.  However, the rest of the movies I can't say I was overly keen on.  Most recently, I found Thor: L&T too jokey, and Black Panther: WF overly serious.  
Quantumania hit a sweet spot for me for a comic book movie, and is a great kick off to ""Phase V"".  Lots of spectacle and fun action scenes, a lot of humour, but also some heart, and just enough seriousness to ground the film, and make you interested in the stakes.  
The movie is not without its flaws, but I thought it was a really fun movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie goes behind a long line of Mediocre Marvel Movies.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie‚Ä¶ beyond my expectations‚Ä¶ Modok's visual effects a little off but loved the movie
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"There are some issues about things the movie put in words, but without actually show it, and some abstracts in the concept. Yet, it's a very good experience, bring us a solo adventure of his tittle, and also a link to the grand Marvel saga in course."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, loved the introduction of Kang!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the movie. The pacing was good, the acting was great, and the battle scene at the end was really cool. Not the best Marvel movie, but nowhere as bad as the last Dr. Strange. I would definitely recommend"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a very good movie if you guys put 3 or less your officially not a marvel fan
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,A solid MCU movie. Gonna be honest if Jonathan Majors wasn't in the movie it wouldn't have nearly been as good. The mid and post credit scenes were amazing.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Seeing some of these other reviews, I'm 100% convinced you could put a carrot on a table and slap the marvel logo on it and people will still give it 5 stars. This movie had a very weak plot, the cringiest dialogue ever, ANOTHER random teenage genius, and CGI that looks worse than a YouTube short. Literally 10 minutes in and just stopped watching. The lunch scene with the pym and lang family was done right awful."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very lack luster Kang was the only bright spot in the movie the scenes that Kang wasn't in dragged this movie had a big problem with too many characters in a lead role position which left a lot of characters just there with nothing to do slim to none funny moments but a couple good laughs rate 5.5/10
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Probably one of the worse movies I have ever seen. The storyline was almost predictable and nothing was a cliffhanger. If I wanted to watch a Disney+ show, like this almost felt like, I would have saved my money and not go to the theater"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie looked beautiful and it really set way for the broader story that is to come in phase 5 and 6. Very enjoyable.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,better than the first two.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Def doesn't deserve the low critics score. Good movie with good visuals, doesn't translate completely to the comics but a very decent movie to set up the next phase of Marvel with Kang follow ups"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Upper tier for Phase 4 MCU movies.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was a CGI circus of a show. Not focused on the characters, but focusing more on the multiverse. Weak"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie. I was high as fuck and I loved every second of it. Paul is Ant-Man as RDJ is Ironman. Great movie, reminded me of Ragnarok woth the revolution stuff."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the beginning of phase 5 of Marvel, after phase 4 that was not as well accepted as the previous ones. A film with this weight should deliver more to Thanos' ""widowers"" the last super villain. Quantumania is not a bad movie at all, futuristic action scenes and comedy scenes give the air of grace, but no more than that. For those who expected a devastating Kang see only a terrifying version with words. To make matters worse, the excess of characters with powers to become big or small loses the special touch of only the original Ant-Man or even the Wasp having these privileges and ends up trivializing their possible powers. For those who want to see a weekend movie and be on top of the new phase of Marvel without expecting too much, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is your movie. Finally, the two post-credits scenes are very ""cold"", even more so for those who have not seen the derivative series on Disney Plus."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It‚Äôs not Endgame, don‚Äôt set your expectations too high. People that rate this movie low need to yank the stick out. It‚Äôs not perfect, it‚Äôs fun and it introduces Kang well. MODOK is goofy because MODOK is always goofy, c‚Äômon it‚Äôs a giant head, what did you expect. Jonathan Majors as Kang is absolutely perfect, I love his portrayal and am so excited for more. Michelle Pfeiffer‚Äôs character was super annoying and unnecessary. Paul Rudd was perfect as always, Cassie‚Äôs character could‚Äôve been developed better but was good for the movie. Storyline was straightforward, not the cleanest, but it was still good. Cinematography was fantastic and it looked amazing. Overall, it was super fun and would highly recommend it."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,not enough kang fights and M.O.D.O.K. shouldnt have been killed off
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the movie. It's not perfect but it was a solid start to Phase 5. The story between Kang and Janet was tremendous. The ending felt a bit rushed but I loved the post credit scene. I'm ready to see more Kang :)
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"While the storyline was a little weak, the visuals, action, and casting of Kang the conquerer were great. l was entertained for the 2 hours."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,it's everything we have come to love about the antman movies! just enjoy it and shush.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the best Ant-man movie yet. While we miss out on Scott's regular cast of characters and the Ant family is pushed to the forefront, Cassie and Kang are the real stars of this movie. The everyday man vibe of the first two movies is replaced with a sci-fi romp. This movie is funny, thoughtful and sets up the next big baddy for the MCU.   My whole family very much enjoyed it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was a lot better than I thought, in my opinion."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's just another bland, forgettable piece of Marvel content. But I'm pretty glad no parents died in this one."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"For all the new Marvel movies that have come out, this is one of the better ones. Definitely should watch Loki S1 prior for Kang's backstory. Fun movie to watch, a lot of special effects, and you get to explore the quantum realm."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't know why people are disliking it. It is one of the best movies of antman though I missed Luis being Luis scenes .  Yeah in some scenes like the close up ones the VFX seems to wear off a bit as they used to panel tech used in mandalorian. It sets the base of Kang and how deadly he is.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was ok, I missed the original actors especially Michael Pe√±a. Didn't have the same charm as the other movies."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"SOPILERS!

Esta pel√≠cula no es mala, que la gente se hiciera falsas y alt√≠simas expectativas es problema de ellos, eso aunado a que est√° muy ""cool"" odiar a Marvel üíÅüèª

Me encanta que vaya directo a la acci√≥n sin tanta introducci√≥n y algo que no dejaron claro es cu√°nto tiempo del mundo real se fueron.

Con MODOK o MODOFK como dir√≠a Scott xD si dejaron caer la pelota, no estuvo mal pero pudo ser mejor ü§∑üèª 

Kang es bueno y si tengo ganas de que entre m√°s en detalle en la serie de Loki

Excelente forma de darle inicio a la fase cinco, no me jueguen pero hasta podr√≠a compararla con el final de Captain America: the first avenger por como dejo abierta la puerta o todo lo que vino despu√©s üí™üèΩ

Toda la encrucijada que tuvo Scott al final de la pel√≠cula tuvo mucho sentido, son preguntas leg√≠timas"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was better than some other marvel movies for sure, but it felt like not much happened. Though there was a lot of action it seemed to be more of a filler movie and not an actual movie by itself. It's funny though"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good entertaining ant-Man movie - glad that I went to see it.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I had low expectations, but just as good as any recent marvel movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"1¬∫ Creo q es una pel√≠cula q no cuenta con desarrollo alguno, empieza y a lo q va y conforme avanza la pel√≠cula es como se va desarrollando lentamente
2¬∫ Una pel√≠cula q ciertamente carece de Buenos efectos visuales con sus anteriores otras pel√≠culas de Marvel e incluso sus predecesoras 
3¬∫ El villano sin duda es lo mejor que la pel√≠cula nos entrega, al igual q las escenas Post-creditos 
4¬∫ Tambi√©n carece del bueno sentido del humor q caracteriz√≥ a sus predecesoras"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,First half was great and then it was all downhill from there. Terrible character development for the ‚Äúvillain‚Äù and the end scene where he is defeated was very anticlimactic. 
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm honestly not sure if I'm over rating this one or not.  I personally enjoyed myself even though most of the jokes fell flat for me, the writing wasn't great, and some of the CGI was just bad.  Overall, the cast was solid, I liked Kang but he's not Thanos.  Paul Rudd was good as expected and i liked the dynamic with the recast Cassie.  The ending had a real chance for some stakes but they chickened out.  What really hurt this for me was M.O.D.O.K.  This is where the effects were the worst and I honestly think they were bad on purpose for laughs.  Wasted opportunity for this character.  I enjoyed the film, but like all Marvel films since Endgame, aside from No Way Home, this movie has issues."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a movie that kicks off phase 5 of Marvel's MCU and I liked it. I hope that the next installments will live up to expectations.

Es una pel√≠cula que da inicio a la fase 5 de MCU de Marvel y me gusto. Espero que las proximas entregas esten a la altura de las espectativas."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Seems that Marvel bashing is now trendy. Oh how fickle people are. Went with the Fam to watch and all thought it was really good. It's a superhero film, not Citizen Kane. It's fun and looks good. Ticked all the boxes for us."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a fun movie with a lot of heart, but one that lacks the plot to back it up. It's full of standard Marvel formula, but it balances the Ant-Man humor with solid characters and dark undertones, making it enjoyable, if a little forgettable. It toes the line of genericism, which is a shame because the Quantum Realm was a huge opportunity for Marvel to show some really, really weird stuff. Some of this absurdism comes through well, but at times it feels like just another alien planet that could be in any other franchise.

The characters and their castings are really what save this movie. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are great as the titular leads, though they really aren't the focus here which is probably for the best. Instead, the movie spends most of its runtime developing Cassie, Janet, and Kang, a refreshing choice. Cassie and Scott have amazing chemistry, in part due to a marvelous (ha) performance from Kathryn Newton. The same can be said for Jonathan Majors, who brings a really nuanced approach to his villainy. Kang can shift from cold and calculated to terrifyingly furious in an instant while consistently feeling natural to watch.

Now it's hard to argue that the plot is good. Frankly, it doesn't make any sense when given more than a few minutes of thought, especially in the wider lens of the whole franchise. Sometimes characters just pop up where they conveniently need to be; maybe some important scenes got cut? It's kind of strange, honestly.

Solid character work mostly makes up for a lackluster plot, making Quantumania a fun ride with intriguing implications for the future of the MCU. Oh, and there are two credits scenes to stick around for (though if you're not already staying until the very end at this point, I don't know what you're doing)."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie exactly what I expected funny and action packed Kang eas amazing and so was the story!!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent character portrayal, although the storyline is conservative, this movie as the beginning of Marvel's fifth phase, has performed well."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a waste. It's almost 100% CGI. The few outside scenes in San Francisco were in no way San Francisco.
So much was ripped off from Star Wars from the ""aliens"" to the Cantina to even hearing Jar Jar's voice.
Kang is not scary or intimidating at all.
Scott's ""Omg I love you, you are the best daughter ever"" look was overdone 10x
In Endgame Scott said that 5 minutes in the Quantum realm was 5 years on earth. But Janet was down there for 30 years and what she did, saw, experienced, etc was WAY more than 30 minutes.
Also ripped off Ragnarok

I love Marvel. But this was just sad.

The end credit scene was more exciting than the whole boring movie"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great. Story line has a great flow to it. Didn‚Äôt feel rushed or too drawn out. Loved it !
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's everything it's supposed to be. Fun, family, and adventure.  Not sure why everyone (critics) expects Marvel movies to be game-changing experiences with every iteration.  People need to stop using the previous 20-something movies as some sort of stepping stone to what Phase-5 should be.  I enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed the villans. I wasn't overly distracted or confused by the storyline. Thats all i need. Personally, went in with even expectations, and, outside of the complete absence of Michael Pe√±a, enjoyed it more than parts I & II, and loved how it set the stage for everything Kang-related that will come.  Also Jonathan Majors was truly glorious in his role, and I'm filled with anticipation for what comes next."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel Did It Again! They do not stop making good, fun movies!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie takes no risks and doesn't hold up to ""the big opener"" of phase 5 we were promised"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was a blast! Do not listen to the critics. I can see how some people might be off put for the strangeness but that's quantum realm.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"One hell of a fun and trippy ride with a way more exciting ending that I initially thought was possible for an Ant Man film. I could have done without some of the silliness throughout the story, but I suppose that's just Marvel being Marvel."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,The best Marvel movie since Spider-Man No Way Home IMO
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Eu recomendo pois √© legal e divertido, tem cenas √≥timas de a√ß√£o e efeitos visuais.
Pontos negativos: Modok n√£o funcionou. Kang sendo inserido prematuramente, Cassie √© interessante mas recebeu p√©ssimos di√°logos. 
Roteiro abaixo da m√©dia."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Well we have reached the apex of Marvel Cringe! With the paint-by-numbers ""plot"" layout. The complete and utter tear down of the title hero that has become the go to for any male legacy Marvel hero. To the continued failures in the CGI mess that Marvel can't seem to get right since Phase 1. The MCU ship has sailed, crashed, and sank to the darkest depths of the sea... All the star power and acting prowess in the world cannot save this muddy, contrived mess. Disney/Marvel needs to Gigantic step back and revisit what made the original films so successful! It took much more than Kevin Feige and wishful thinking! I do not recommend wasting your time or money on this. No stakes, nothing to gain, nothing lost, and nothing you will miss without watching a recap of Loki season 1."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Five stars to the Ants! üêúüêúüêúüêúüêú
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is directed to a rather disappointing, unimaginative, and uncreative ""seen-it-all-before"" formula by Peyton Reed, who also helmed the first two installments in the Ant-Man series. It's not a terrible movie, and I'm sure many viewers will be entertained and wowed by the world building inside the Quantum Realm. But I was sadly underwhelmed as I was hoping for a different type of realm: one that is truly unique, different, out-of-this-world, and even hard to grasp and understand. Instead, I felt it was a rather dimly-lit, messy place that could still exist within the constructs of our understanding of physics and the world we inhabit. In other words, this didn't feel like a different dimension. It didn't feel otherworldly. And there are missed opportunities to build and make our visit to the Quantum Realm a weird, magical, and truly trippy awe-inspiring ride. 
To add to its detriments, this movie feels like a copy of ""Star Wars"" meets ""Strange World"". There are some attempts at trying to create cool, new alien creatures as semi-interesting, yet minuscule supporting characters. However, these are definitely not developed enough to establish a meaningful connection, nor are they inventive enough to really inspire wonder. There are scenes throughout that are startlingly similar to several of the ""Start Wars"" films, but I won't mention specifics to keep this as spoiler-free as possible.
At the end of the day, I felt distant from the story. I did not care about the characters as much as I did in the first two installments, and the plot of a rebellion and a ruthless dictator-like villain also feels rehashed and very ""Star Wars"". The attempt to build some emotional resonance with the Scott Lang and Cassie Lang characters, via the father-daughter conflict, as well as the involvement of Hope Van Dyne as the Wasp, feels underveloped and underutilized - almost like they just put their familial conflicts on the back burner as the movie progressed. 
The movie eventually becomes what feels like a misplaced war movie against Kang the Conqueror. Jonathan Majors as Kang is one of the saving graces of this movie because his performance is commanding, intimidating, and full of personality. The scenes that stand out the most belong to him, as well as Michelle Pfeiffer, who is strong and captivating as Janet Van Dyne. 
As the first entry in the 5th age of Marvel, I was not impressed and rather bored. I hope the MCU strives to find ways to make better written stories that are more inventive and memorable. And let's amp up those special effects because they're getting sloppy. Also, let's bring back Michael Pena's funny and spunky Luis character, who is sorely missed."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It's Greer than a lot of other marvel movies that have better critic scores.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Everything that made the previous 2 Ant-Man movies is completely missing from this green screen and bad CGI sodden sequel. Scott Lang arguably saved the entire Marvel universe in Endgame but here he is reduced to the bubbling lazy dad who's not doing enough to help ""the cause"" of peaceful San Francisco protests according to the suddenly annoying and daughter. The Wasp character is hardly present for a title character, probably due to the actresses stand on vaccinations. Overall the movie makes zero sense, has none of the heart of the previous films, and seems like it was edited and recut heavily leading to some head scratching transitions. While not as bad as Wakanda Forever, She-Hulk, or The Eternals, it suffers from the same heavy emphasis on special effects and not enough emphasis on writing characters that folks will care about."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's good. Not nearly as bad as the critics make it seem. They are overreacting.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I think the movie is really funny and fun. Paul Rudd did a great job and the other actors. It probably one of my top 3 movie
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought the visuals were stunning and the movie was funny.  There were a few parts that were pretty weird that I didn't like, but overall I enjoyed it!  Enough to see it twice! (Though part of the reason for that was that I wanted to see the end credits scene again!)"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Realmente decepcionante!!! MARVEL cada vez mas patetico...
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Como apresentam o Kang sendo t√£o forte, sendo uma amea√ßa para o multiverso, mas perdendo para formigas"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Was awesome and the storyline was great and easy to follow.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie was entertaining and visually satisfying. We are super hero geeks and will watch anything Marvel or DC so this was a fun ride and my son LOVED it.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun and Entertaining movie! The whole family loved it!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantumania is both hilarious and exciting and a perfect jumping off point for the remainder of the Multiverse Saga.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,By far the best Ant-Man movie yet. I loved it and am hyped for the stories that are yet to come
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Plot was great, good comedy, plenty of green screen action. Wasp could have been left out."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The scope of this movie was insane. Jonathan Majors steals the entire show. The Wasp was way under used. Fun flick overall.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Deleting my old review now that I have seen the film at last.
#disney #mcu #marvel

Just make the post credits and the mid credits scenes the ties to the MCU for spinoff/sequal baiting. Make the story in front of you work first.

Also, DON'T YOU DARE LAY OFF ANY OF THE EFFECTS ARTISTS AND ANIMATORS. They are keeping you alive. If anyone needs the whip cracked over them its the cameramen for the green screen studios and the actors. It was frankly amazing how little the veteran actors gave a shit on set in this film. I know that invites Bill Murrey to come to my house and hit me with a chair, but i don't care. Nobody but Kang SOLD ME the film. And that is not saying that ""dramatic=good"". The Antman movies have been on the lighter side of the MCU and REFRESHING back when most of the hero films were melodramatic*. But you can sell a joke with conviction as well. John Cleese in Monty Python and the Holy Grail sells the determined warrior and knight of duty WHILE being a maniac worth laughing at. Leslie Neilson is always the dramatic detective to sell the joke in the Naked Gun movies. Clowns can take themselves very seriously to make themselves more farcical. That is basically why we loved Tim Curry in 100 of his roles. Conviction in comedy connects to the audience. And I just know that, in a film with this many celebrities, a director is basically a baby sitter getting the actors to cooperate just long enough to meet a shooting schedule RATHER than a maestro to an orchestra to keep all parts of a symphony on the same beat and intensity.

You can do better, Disney, you have done better, and you are the best thing that ever happened to Super Heroes as a genre, in my opinion. You got us OFF the James Bond model that made Batman tedious or the Christmas film model that made Superman a ponderous messiah figure. You made super heroes breath, make mistakes, and make friends with other heroes. You are the guys that made Captain America Civil War and the Black Panther movies. Stuff you can be proud of forever. But, since Guardians of the Galaxy taught you how much room you had to be silly, you overused your license to be silly. Warner Bros/DC comics made the mistake of making all their heroes like Batman for many years. You are beginning to make the mistake of making too many of your films Guardians of the Galaxy. Verisimilitude is one thing, but an ice cream shop with only one flavor is an ice cream shop no one wants to go to*.


*You got different heroes for different flavors and different moods.
Political drama with speculative futurism based on overlooked history is Black Panther.
Epic fights and betrayals WAS Thor, then Thor became where epic fights lead to comedic exhaustion.
Contemporary American identity issues were Captain America's wheelhouse.........though the villains in Falcon and the Winter Soldier were so A-political that they had no bite or threat to them. They resonated with nothing.
I hope when you get back to making Hulk movies, you can write about trauma, rage, regret, and relationships like a Hulk story should. She Hulk was great for being funny and kooky, but Jennifer Walters is not Bruce Banner. You need to unfunny the Hulk when he gets mainline movies again.
And when all these other dramatic options have their flavors out there, THEN you can have the 3 ring circus of Guardians or the standup night of Antman to compliment the drama. More diverse flavors on the buffet table for your giant audience. Don't go to the buffet table and start stirring the pudding with the corn and the teriyaki beef and the french fries and the ceasar salad. People don't want a mush of everything. They want to try everything one or two at a time. 

So please.........get your act together before crap like Micheal Bay's Transformers, YA novel teen-pocalypses, Harry Potter clones, Zombies, Jason Bourne knockoffs, or trenchcoat matrix ninjas take over hollywood again. Keep the hero train rolling by remembering this: There are different heroes for different people"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun and epic inclusion to the MCU, and their best movie since Endgame."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think it's a fun movie, the last act gets a little messy but other than that it's a good time. Jonathon majors easily stole every scene he was in, he reminds me of the Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch who stole every scene she was in in Doctor Strange 2"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Love thar movie! Thanks Marvel!!!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing special effects! There was a moderate amount of the trademark Ant-Man humor, but overall the movie was more serious than its predecessors which is fair, given the darker nature of the subject. Overall very good, and a welcome introduction to phase 5 of the MCU."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's fast food movies, an excess of childish jokes, boring history on top of a bunch of CGI scribbles, it's like mixing Spy Kids and the Star Wars sequels. Majors' performance is the only salvageable thing about this movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was very action packed, with so many special effects! True to the Marvel movies. I need to see it again to get all the details!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great visuals! I had a blast watching it.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,That was a good movie Jonathan majors did that 
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"certainly not great and slow at times, but overall I enjoyed it. The characters are very likeable and Johnathon Majors was great as Kang. That character arc will be great to watch unfold moving forward"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun Marvel movie. Compared to others, it seemed a little ""slow"", but there was the tough job of all the exposition necessary to introduce and make understandable Kang the Conqueror - who will be a key player in the next several movies in this Phase of the MCU. There were some ""gaps"" (like how Casey got added as a ""suited up shrinker"") and the portrayal of M.O.D.O.K was pitiful (really? ""I'm a dick"" as his central raison d'etre?) But it portrayed the Quantum Realm in a visually interesting manner, and set up the next set of movies to deal with timelines, variants and Loki, oh my!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The kick off for phase 5 was handled very well. 
Beautiful to view...strange...menacing...heavy on foreshadowing. 
Scott Lang's character arc was very well illustrated by the end of this installment.
His never ending devotion to his daughter Cassie, his respect for his predecessor Hank,
and his continually deepening love for Hope were all on full display. His reluctance, disbelief, 
and full acceptance of his role as a true superhero since his original introduction seemed
believably organic and true.
Michelle Pfeiffer...nuff said.
AND then there is Kang!
Jonathan Majors gave us a little tease for his character in Loki, and it was intriguing. Our
first full on encounter with Kang, and some of his abilities, was quite impressive.
I'm anxious to see more of him!
I believe Kevin Feige when he says this is the first major installment, which is starting to gather
all the disjointed elements of phase 4, and steers us towards our next Avengers showdown.
I am totally here for the ride!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This is must see overall a great movie
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked it, and will watch it again on home video."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst movie I ever seen so far
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a fantastic addition to the Ant-Man franchise. What made this movie stand out from the previous ones was the perfect blend of action and seriousness that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. The exploration of the Quantum Realm and the introduction of Khang's character were truly remarkable, and I was impressed by the acting performances. Overall, I believe this is the best Ant-Man movie to date, and I am confident that anyone who watches it will thoroughly enjoy it as much as I did."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a fun movie. The visuals are amazing, there are some fun callbacks. Jonathan Majors continues to 100% deliver on Kang. It's not a tentpole, but it's not supposed to be."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"What can I say, I love Ant-Man and The Wasp. Quantamania is Marvel Family Fun. Ant-Man franchise is all about family, forgiveness, and self sacrifice."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Some of the most fun I've had with a marvel movie. Not overly serious but has its moments. It's a super fun popcorn movie and I laughed my butt off watching it! Some weird bits but looked great and I'd 100% watch again.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Story was good but there are some flaws.  They should have increased the runtime.  So,the audience could connect to characters for audience. 
Kang character is awesome. Finally this movie is only for Kang interduction"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was hard to identify a tone in this movie, in one scene we can have Kang killing innocents and in the next scene, we have someone making an inappropriate joke ten seconds later. This killed any of the tension I felt and before we even go to the quantanmania the writers do not set a clear enough issue that needs to be solved or to push the characters through the plot. In Spider-Man: No Way Home, we establish why Peter Parker wants to create this new realm and there is an issue set up before we go to this realm, meaning that it pays off when we as the audience see our heroes accomplish the goal in the movie. We do not have this here, we just have Kang being awesome while everyone else is meh."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was entertaining for the most part. I thought in some places it was reaching and in others it reached too far with really short legs.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was not an okay movie for me. But not a fan.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked the tight storyline. I thought Johnathan Majors was amazing. MODOK was perfect for me. There was just enough silliness but mostly  action. the scenery was fantastic with the new wrapround green screens. 
perfect move - no. but one of my favorite post-endgame marvel movies."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It works, its worth the watch and builds the story line of the MCU as a whole."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,I hate minimum characters comments
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This reviewers don't know. how to give ratings they didn't understood the movie so they have given this scores, look at audience score. For this movie I don't know how they consider themselves as critics.


Everyone should watch this movie I've enjoyed it from beginning to end."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed Quantumania from beginning to end. Jonathan Majors was amazing as Kang the Conqueror. It was great to see all of the cast back (that could realistically be back) for another Ant-Man movie. I was wondering how they would integrate ants into the storyline, and I wasn't disappointed. The Trailer doesn't do the movie justice."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Good introduction to phase 5
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was really good and it was visually stunning. It felt like I was watching a Star Wars Movie set in the MCU which I thought was pretty cool. Kang was menacing and is definitely one of my favorite villains. There was only a few things I didn't like which is how the story was kind of off and could be confusing at times. It was also predictable so I knew a lot about what was going to happen also because the trailers gave away a lot.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Super fun movie. Marvel doing what they do. Fun action and humor. Just what comic movies should do. And I mean Paul rudd. The guy was born hilarious. The one thing I didn't  like is how MODOK ended up being in the end
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,SHawshank Redemption was beteter
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the story and foreshadowing of the new ""Thanos"" level threat.  Special effect were amazing as well.  Perfect blend of humor and action."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thrilling fun - much better in scope and execution than Thor4. Avoiding trailers and spoilers is the best way to judge a movie. No expectations, just open curiosity. I loved this movie and recommend it to all movie lovers."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Not the best MCU movie but still quite enjoyable! My kids liked it a lot! Good start for Phase 5
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a Marvel movie. Not the best, not the worst. Entertaining!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie to watch for sure! Only problem is how the plot ends.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is basically a Marvel Star Wars movie, and better than most Star Wars movies."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Honestly, it was fine. It wasn't trash, but there was some weird stuff like with MODOK and lots of plotholes. Cassie was annoying the whole movie, and I hope she doesn't appear in more movies after this.
I loved both villains, but felt both were short lived
Too much time was dedicated to criticizing Antman and how he doesn't help anyone.
Bill Murray was in the movie, but I wish he had a little more screentime.
65%"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is one of those movies you see from time to time in a long movie series.  This is not the big revel of ""End Game"" but is a transition movie.  This movie sets the chess pieces in the places that they need to be for follow on offerings.  In that regard this is a good movie, not great, but good.  It is enjoyable as a Saturday morning matinee movie.  Bag of popcorn and your favorite soda and just relax and go along for the ride.  In the end it gets you to the place you need to be and you are set for the next movie in the series.  
I really liked Katy O'Brian as Jentorra.  She sold me on her abilities and looked like she knew her business.  As an Army vet I would serve with her anytime.  

Go see the movie and just enjoy the ride."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was awsome i loved, friends don't believe in the review of critics, this movie is awsome, CGI was good, Jonathan Majors did a great work overall everything is good. Guys don't compare it with endgame or infinity war this movie is just a part of ant man not a part of avengers its an intro to other MCU movies and series, without watching loki and other ant man movies you won't get anything from this movie"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film was odd. I never really connected with the characters because there were too many to care about. And none of them have any time spent on them to establish who they are because the film makers obviously assume you know them aleady, which is all a bit weird. So in the end it was more of a wiz-bang special effects festival that I wasn't supposed to spend to much time caring about. That said it clipped by at an acceptable pace. I was entertained by the flashing lights but little else. Marvel's MCU films won't last long if they keep to this formula."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was good, not great but good for sure. It definitely could've had less comedy in it and more of a serious tone to it. I give it a solid 7 out of 10."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Hard to follow.   The villain did do a good job of acting .    It that interesting of a movie.    Not Near as good as the first one.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie feels like the others in phase 4, like Thor love and thunder, doctor strange in the multiverse of madness.... It is just mediocre AT BEST. Can argue that its less.  It is fun and it sets up Phase 5.  Just go watch it to get it over with.  Spiderman No Way Home is still the best movie/ MCU project since Endgame."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,cgi is good story is meeh
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was so excited about thia movie and it was a big let down , Marvel is on a downfall with the release of Thor L&T , Wakanda forever and Quantumania . The movie did not get the usual charm that an Antman movie usually got . The movie had so much potential and was my biggest Marvel let down"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"As for critics' reviews on the net this was supposed to be the worst Marvel movie ever. Man, are they wrong! This one is, in fact, by far the best of the 3 Ant-Man movies and surely one of the better Marvel flicks. I have to admit that most of the movie is kept way to dark (somebody didn't want to pay the electricity bill), but the visuals in general are out of this world. Well, after all, they are inside the Quantum realm, so the creators could let their fantasies go wild. If you thought Avatar would have reached the possible limits of weird and exotic beings, then you are very wrong. This movie is like a soup of all Star Wars movies, Avatar, Ready Player One, Valerian, Buckaroo Banzai and then still some more. At moments Paul's and his daughter's running in front of a green screen, pretending to flee some attack, is possibly a bit too much, but all in all it is great action entertainment with the occasional comic relief. 8/10 points. I'll definitely watch it again."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good laughs, great eye candy, and more Ants!!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"movie was done really well.  you can see that they put a lot into: ""go big or go home"" - and it was worth it.  Great movie, great character development and great story."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it. Could have used another 20 minutes of Kang being a badass, really would have established that threat but thats a minor quibble.  Missed Scotts trio of boys."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I found the movie highly entertaining, although I would like to see more character growth when it comes to Paul Rudd's character.  It's a little hard to see where his character arc is going.  

This movie kept me engaged throughout and the action scenes did not feel like something I'd seen a thousand times before.  I'm looking forward to watching it again when it comes out on Disney +."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lousy plot. A huge step down with the first 2 movies. Original Wasp didn't inform anyone of the most important threat she has ever known ? Are we supposed to believe that specially after Thanos?  Scott Lang characterization is so far from who he really is and has been shown in previous movies. Mostly emotionless and definitely not fun. 2h and most characters have no arc.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just ignore those wannabe critics. This is definitely not a film for everyone, yes we can all agree to this, it does have some goofy scenes, but all in all, this is a must see movies with exceptional acting from Jonathan  Majors. The visuals are just wow... like the Marvel's version of Avatar and Star Wars combined. Absolutely loved it and if you set your expectations right, not high or low, you'll definitely love this movie!!!!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen this movie twice. Fun movie, ties into the multiverse storyline very well."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very disappointing. Marvel is desperately reaching and not landing
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant Man is a character who's lighthearted, fun and those movies have that theme too so when trying to introduce a character that's going to rival Thanos as the next big bad it can be kind of tricky to balance between those two very different themes. As someone that likes the Ant Man character & Paul Rudd but also was looking forward to Kang I was satisfied with how it turned out but the use of these themes clashing could have been better."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fresh change of pace for the MCU. Last year or so of MCU content has felt a lot like homework. This movie is refreshing. Lots of cool and funny moment. Paul Rudd is great, Johnathan Majors is excellent! There is a big issue with Michelle Pfeiffer's character and a lot of that could have been cleaned up in a way that would have made her character less frustrating. Looking past that, movie is worth a ticket."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a fun movie. I think due to the success of the franchise, people expect something earth-shattering from each marvel release. This isn't that, but its a quirky, funny and relatively fast-paced movie and worth going to see in the cinema. If you're a fan of Paul Rudd you'll like it. Didn't really catch the hype about Jonathan Majors."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't let the critics deter you, this movie was amazing. Most excited I've been about marvel since endgame."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,KANG IS THE BEST VILLAIN IN THE MOVIE
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible and cheap CGI, diminishing Kang's status and a boring and repetitive story. I don't know if it's a production problem or just that they believe all movies need at least 120 minutes, but it get's really boring"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is great they set up kang in a very good way, as a huge threat that will take more than a few characters to beat while at the same time retaining the light spirit of an ant man movie , the way i see it they had 2 points to make:
1. This is a 3rd Ant-Man film but on a huge scale(pun intended) no identity loss
2. Establishing kang as the next big threat in the MCU 
The Only thing that i might consider a let down that there were some characters i would've liked for them to have more screen time but at the end of the day it's a movie and the main cast itself are a few ."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"And I very much enjoyed this movie, and I think this point everybody can see that the only thing that matters is the fan perception critics are paid to say over there actual opinions"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn't like the pacing but loved the action with antman and kang
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the action! Kang actor is the best.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Bestest movie the last fight is amazing.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was lots of fun. Not perfect, but fun. Kang was great.  The movie is very sci-fi and I liked that a lot. You do have to be prepared for it to be weird, but in a good way. Watching the Loki show and Doctor Strange 2 will help understand lots of it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had a great time with this movie. I think that its action, visual effects, humor, and dramatic bits were well balanced."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie manages to balance the giant stakes of Kang the Conqueror while also focusing on the human drama that has always made the Ant-Man franchise loveable.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was great, was a little weird for an ant-man movie but the into to an Avnegers level threat was great"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great family movie.  Enough comedy and action to keep the kids entertained.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved Johnathon Majors as Kang . He was excellent! Did not care for the new actress as Cassie. She was very bland. And did not like MODOK one bit
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Johnathan Majors' Kang steals the show, but sadly it is not enough to save the film from CGI BS and a messy story that could've hit home. I really expected more since this is the start of phase 5. I really feel like the MCU as a whole has been on a decline post Endgame. Additionally by the end of the movie I no longer saw Kang as a threat."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ignore all the reviews mildy trashing Ant-Man 3 for being an Ant-Man movie. Of course it's CGI heavy, it has to be for the setting. It's a fun movie and it's worth your time and money to go see it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I personally thought the movie was great. My daughter and I both loved it. Filled with action and laughs. The critics just need to remeber it's never too late to stop being a dick.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a decent movie overall that was needed as a gateway into the Kang Series. It was light hearted much like most of the Ant Man films have been don't watch this movie expecting an Endgame level of film. But do expect to enjoy the Ant man characters become more widely established and developed in the film with some good action sequences and suspense as Ant Man came about as close to dying in this as he ever has.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining, a good setup for the current phase."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the movie, fuck rotten tomatoes critic score, get a life."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I genuinely don't understand the amount of hate this movie has received. Is the movie one of the weaker MCU movies? Yeah probably. But overall, this was not bad at all. I actually had a great time watching this. The thing that jumped out the most for me is the astonishing special effects. Some of the special effects in the MCU had been lacking as of late but this movie was spot on. From the scenery, the creatures, and M.O.D.O.K. The special effects were incredible. The cast obviously was great and I loved all of the characters. Jonathon Majors as Kang the Conqueror was perfect. I was so excited to see Kang in action after Loki and this didn't disappoint one bit. On top of that, this movies features two end credit scenes that are monumental for the future of the MCU. Despite the fantastic things about this movie, there are plenty of negatives that really hold this back unfortunately. The writing was glaring flaw that held back this movie. There were things that happen that don't make sense for a character to do or abandoned plot lines that could've been expanded upon more. Also the dialogue at certain points wasn't great at all. Overall, this was very entertaining to watch and I had a good time. I don't understand the hate this got because it was not a terrible movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"There were parts of this movie I had fun with but lots more parts I had issues with. If you're looking for a sequel to Ant-Man & The Wasp, this ain't it. It's more an episode in the world's highest-budget TV series. That is, it focuses too much on feeding the beast than on the Ant-Fam. Maggie, Paxton, Kurt and even Luis are not in this movie. The conflict between Scott and Cassie, set up as this big deal early in the film, is disposed of fairly quickly. The movie is less about Scott or even Cassie, the future Avenger, and more about Janet and Kang. There's a fundamental incongruence between the world of Scott Lang and the aims of Kang the Conqueror. It's like if you had asked Matt Murdock or Luke Cage to take on Thanos and tried to find a way to make it personal. And in the era of The Volume and COVID, few of the things the characters are interacting with seem like they're actually there.

Go, have fun, just don't think a lot about it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't see this one as grand return of pre-endgame era of MCU but Antman and the Wasp: Quantamania does deserve a crown when compared to the other Phase 4 MCU projects. Jonathan Majors dis a fantastic job portraying Kang The Conqueror and Paul Rudd, although had a very plain script, did do the justice it deserved. I do believe though that script could've been a little bit more darker in the end. Would've loved some deaths or real stakes. I hope this movie launches Phase 5 with some banger projects and proper stakes like Phase 3 had."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The plot seemed great. The way the movie was made and where it took place it covered one of the major pot points in the MCU; the one where other heroes would be around and be able to help. The film taking place in the quantum realm solves that problem. The only issue I took with the show was two small nods to liberalism about promoting socialism and anti Police sentiment. The rest of the movie was great. Acting was good, it was mostly serious with small comedy bits throughout. Since Iron Man died, this is the best MCU movie after Spider-Man No Way Home."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"My 16 yr old saw this and although we are Marvel fans, he said this was one of the worst ones he's seen- right up there with Eternals. Jokes were silly and just thrown in for random laughs. Acting by some of the characters was horrible. Fight scenes were never-ending when they could've been wrapped up sooner (although he said there were less fight scenes than other Marvel movies. I guess they dumped it all in one big scene.) No real plot. He said the only redeeming quality was the acting and script of Kang. Really liked that. Otherwise, he said it might appeal to younger kids and his 11 yr old brother would probably like it. Lol."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it's not getting a fair chance and it was quite entertaining and good laughs better than Thor love and thunder!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,There was not enough action
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,My family had a great time. Fun movie. 
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,this movie was possibly the worst marvel cinematic expeirence ive ever witnessed marvel has really fallen off hopefully the new spider man movie can bring it back.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I Like The change of Tone from Comedy To dark.
Jonathan Acting Is Mind Blownüî•.
Can't Wait For His Future MCU Project.
And There is 2 post Credit Scene which is very important for future project.ü§´"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I would give it just an OK. I disliked the daughters character immensely and was hoping she‚Äôd get killed off. The actor playing Kang was forgettable and could have been cast a lot better. The alien characters and Bill Murray were my favorite parts. The head with miniature arms and legs was just creepy and strange. This is more of something I‚Äôd recommend waiting to get it at Redbox.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was well worth the wait and I can't wait to see it 10 more times
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. I'm a kitchen manager not a wanna-be critic who post for likes on Instagram and here so I guess it's easier for me to enjoy.

It starts well and builds from there, Kang is amazing. I can't wait to see more of him. I think the best way to explain this movie is everything love and thunder tried and failed spectacularly at, ant-man smashed out of the park.

The only thing that let it down for me was we saw this at Vue cinema in Portsmouth and I don't think I'll ever be going back there again, seat were dirty. There was a group of little roadman kids that should have been with their parents or pushing off a bridge but that took away from the film a bit."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great villain and the actors do their best under a welter of CGI. It has a flavour of Avatar and one scene was like Palpatine looking over his forces. Nonetheless my grandson and I have spent worse two hours of our life! It was an enjoyable further romp through Marvel's universe.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is entertaining, and the mid- and post-credits scenes are incredible, but the critics' rating is low because most of them are dumb."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome! Love the humor and action! All the tie-ins to the rest of the marvel universe! Can't wait to see it again.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was both funny and exciting. My son and I loved it.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun to Watch and easy-to-understanding. I don't know how the comics described it, but as a non-comic watchers, I love this film. Must watch!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,great movie with good action wish they would have utilized some characters more and kept some themes consistent but other than that great watch
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had the right amount of campy, heartwarming, and loved the amount of sci-fi. Really hard to do MODAK right but I felt like they nailed it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,One tiny but fine dish which leads a great start to Phase 5.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really really good movie omg. Just like maybe one or two things i was kinda like hmmmm about but they were mainly style choices, but otherwise i thought the story was great and the ending was conclusive but open to allow more movies. I cant wait to see what they do next!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyed it, but the narrative stakes and character arcs seemed to wander or not progress at all. Great performances, especially by Jonathan Majors & Michelle Pfeiffer. But overall, the keeping the movie to 2 hour running time (seems to be a mandate of late by Disney), has hurt not only this film but the last year's theatrical releases. 

Still a MCU fan, but yeah. Film as a whole was Meh ish."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked it, but did not love it. The movie plot was kind of predictable. Some of the jokes were hilarious. It was missing the support of the supporting cast, that made the earlier two films great to watch. The lead cast stayed true to their story arc though. And, the movie did not need previous movies to help it tell it's story."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very much an MCU ‚Äúpopcorn movie‚Äù where they do just enough to keep you entertained and you don‚Äôt really have to think much. Jonathan majors as Kang absolutely steals the show and I‚Äôm hype to see more Kang in the MCU.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly enjoyed this movie, saw it opening night with my brother and we both had a positive experience. MODOK was a bit of a let down but John Majors is HIM."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly this should have negative stars. It was abysmal with no coherent storyline or characters that you care about. The only thing that made it tolerable was seeing it in a theater that had the new screen X technology. Honestly, one of the worst movies I've seen in years, my 12 year old grandson thought it was pretty good so I suppose if you are a super immature adult or a very young child you might sort of enjoy this otherwise I would steer clear."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I heard a lot of bad things about this movie from both the critics and the Fandom Menace.  Thankfully I didn't listen to either of them.  This was a better film than Eternals, Shangchi and much better than Multiverse of Madness.  It was a such a s solid story which is usually not the case in more recent MCU films.  They kept this a family affair and I think that was good.  Antman is a hero in his own small world.  It would be tough (but not impossible) add another Avenger for the box office draw this movie needed to reach Multiverse of Madness' 1st Weekend.  Despite this I was still very satisfied.  I heard their were reshoots for more jokes but it didn't think they were over the top at all (this is no Ragnarock or Love and Thunder) and it's not corny.  Jonathon Majors Kang really was shown to be a convincing yet different kind of villain.  It's definitely rewatchable.  I give it 8/10"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A good looking entertaining movie overall there were some moments in it that could have been taken out or changed but you can have that in any movie.

I really enjoyed the interaction between Antman and his daughter and her role in this

This was a solid start to phase 5 and a good setup for Kang.  I enjoyed the movie and I would recommend going to see it in the theater."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not the best but in my wheel house. It knows what it wants to be... sort of.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad writing: (multiple scenes of Janet Van Dyne avoiding explaining the situation only to keep the story going), 
Bad writing: telepathic guy yells to Ant-Man multiple times: ""Where are you from?"" And just a few seconds later, Ant-Man asks him how he know something and he answers: "" I can read your mind.""     ....... Really?
Anybody can be Ant-Man because Scott does not have any special skills except for the suit. Hank Pym is the real hero for having invented everything (and more...).
Hope is a useless character except for one scene where she saves Scott.
Michelle Pfeiffer does not seem to know how to act in front of a green screen. 
And not great directing: some green-screen scenes have characters with different reactions to what's in front of them.
Just not great.   
And the version of 'Goodbye yellow brick road' from the trailer isn't even in the movie!!!!!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too much talking. Not enough action. This Ant-Man movie isn't funny like the others.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Since they can't really shrink that small. The visual and CGI was AMAZING. The story was different and fun. Best one night stand movie ever.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. Great graphics. Good future movies.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Spoiler alert:  It's pretty silly.  But it's good enough for a Sunday afternoon matinee.  

There's no purpose in pointing out sloppy plot lines or deep character inconsistencies, because it's a superhero movie.  But, since I'm here...

Is it a great superhero movie?... no.  But it's fine.

Is it a good Antman movie?... no.  I feel they abandoned Antman's genre to deliver a grumpy dad and teen daughter movie.  Honestly, they should kill off Paul's Antman, and let his daughter or the PapaAnt take over, since either of them are more heroic and likable.

Do the hero(sssss) make sense?... no.  
Antman was flat, selfishly motivated to save only his daughter in the beginning and remained so throughout movie: no growth, serving only as a scapegoat for dumb jokes.  
AntMama lied about Kang for no reason thus creating this whole mistake in present and in quantum blahblah, and honestly Kang might have been right and she still didn't tell them.  
Antdaughter got shafted by this plot, teased with interesting character, then whiplashed between the unexplained role of smart scientist then costumed fighter then whatever as the plot wandered back to Antman's dull performance.   
AntPapa was nearly the best role in movie and I wish the others had died and it was entirely about him and his ants.  
Refugees or residents in quantum realm made no sense in fact it makes Antpapa's previous rescue of Antmama completely implausible.  
Kang the Conqueror, man, this movie does him wrong.  First of all, he IS the protagonist.  All these Antfools shrank their brains disproportionately and couldn't bother to listed to him.  Secondly, why would other Kangs ever consider this one to be a threat and what did he ever conquer?  The only power he manifests reliably is to make step stools for himself so he doesn't have to jump off of things all his other abilities disappear whenever they'd actually be useful.  

The Villains: 
Jokes.  Oof.  Jokes about holes, ingestion of other people's body fluids, and awkward dating people outside marriage.  Why... what writer would choose these jokes.  Even within the story, the characters inability to communicate basic needs or even the truth to each other was staggering.  
Money.  It's pretty obvious that PapaAnt and the entire Antsquad is extremely dangerous and they are doing stupidly dangerous things in a basement with safety controls and with no regard to the millions of other people living nearby.  They literally risk the future of the universe for their personal desires and whims in this movie.  Perhaps that's what this movie was actually about.  It shows us Antman getting free perks and preferential treatment from a stupid and adoring public,  and abusing expensive technology and his fame for his own personal wealth, literally frames his character with his arrogant indifference to the dangers he introduces to others.  IF... IF this movie had accentuated this more and made this a believably intended theme then I'd give it tons of credit.  Instead it's the cruddy distillate that surfaces after 2 hours of run time.

Still.  
Kang was well acted for what they gave him.  He should have murdered the lying fools and saved the universe the best way he knew how.  That would have been a better movie.
PapaAnt and Cassie were fun.  They should have survived the other lying fools and shown us a fun and upbeat way to make a difference for people who need help, animals or people.  That also would be a better movie.
So 3 stars for 3 decent actors."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A must watch, just like any MCU movie. Everything is impossible, as always, but still is fun."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was simply lackluster and terrible in story writing, world and character building, pacing, character motivation, conflict, and stakes. 

This just goes to show how most of the Marvel films are really mediocre, overrated films garnished by too devoted fans."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant Man and the Wasp:  Quantamania is one of the more disappointing entries in the Marvel Universe franchise.  The movie relies way too much on digitally created environments and has a storyline that in my opinion is way too predictable.  I do not want to go too much into detail about that because I wish to avoid spoilers, but I was able to correctly predict lines of dialogue as I was watching the movie.  The movie's terrific cast is given hardly anything to work with in this movie.  Their performances are also not their best.  Considering the tremendous talent in this movie that was something I was not expecting.  Academy Award winner Michael Douglas clearly steals every scene he is in.  He alone carries the movie in my opinion.  The interactions between Scott Lang/Ant Man (Paul Rudd) and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) are incredibly hollow.  They have very little chemistry and their dialogue is painfully contrived.  As much as I hate to say it, there are just too many problems with Ant Man and the Wasp:  Quantamania for me to recommend it.  Marvel has done better."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,it's a good family fun movie... more humor than wakanda forever and not as campy as thor 4.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics, its clear they know nothing of Marvel anymore and the direction its going. If you're a true Marvel fan you'll have your ups and downs, but it's a key film in setting up Kang Dymasty and Secret Wars. Must watch"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I typically love Marvel movies and enjoyed the prior ant-man movies.  This one just didn't come together for me. Jokes fell flat, pace was at times dragging, a lot of inconsistencies that were obvious and bothersome. A lot of the effects just seemed silly and ridiculous- meant to be funny but just didn't pull it off. Too many ideas stuffed into one movie and tried to explain away with one or two lines of dialogue. I went with three other major marvel fans and we all came out disappointed."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"For an Ant-Man movie, it was good.  A fun ride, entertaining.  Don't expect epic, but it does finally introduce Marvel's next big villain.  Feels like finally there's a goal, unlike the past 2 years of movies and shows that in the end, mean nothing.  Go see it, and enjoy it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Antman Quantumania is a fun movie. Not what I was expecting and a bit cliche but still worth going to see. NOT as bad as ETERNALS like the doom and gloom critics are saying. Jokes or moments that were supposed to be funny fell flat so not as comical as the previous Ant Man movies. I'd recommend it's worth a matinee price.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I personally thought the movie was great. It had lots of action and the special effects and scenery was spectacular. I guess I don't critique movies as deeply as most, because at my age, I just want to be entertained by my childhood heroes. Loved it! It wasn't as humorous as the first two films but that was okay because of the storyline called for a more serious approach in my opinion."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"3D version was great! acrion packed, good story line."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The story created a great connection between what was and what is to come. Moreover, it provided another fun adventure with some snappy dialogue. 

The insertion of MODOK seemed haphazard. Graphics related to MODOK were poor. As well, Bill Murray's part was gratuitous. 

The end credits were truly worth the wait. Kang was formidable and left you wanting to know more."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"None of these actors are looking t for their Oscar this film‚Ä¶it's not its intent.  Is it a film to bring enjoyment and escapism to an everyday life?  Absolutely!  There is humor and action, a story that lives outside the realm of reality, and personally, I enjoyed the visual aesthetics of the Quantum Realm. While it is getting blasted by many‚Ä¶I put it in the middle of Marvel films‚Ä¶not near the bottom."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I liked the pace of the movie and most of the characters. I wasnt clear of the relationship of the elder parents - wasnt sure whose parents they were.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable movie, can't get bored while watching that's why you can watch it more than once. Lot's of things doesn't make any sense but marvel fans are going to like it. And must watch if you don't want to miss Kang the Conqueror's first introduction (not He Who Remains) in MCU."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"visually awesome.  The story line was good, and it seemed to flow very well with the previous movies."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another in a recent line of mediocre Marvel films. The story line is fine. Visuals are great. Actors are also fine. Somehow the professional writers make the dialogue so bad it‚Äôs inseparable to a 14-year-olds essay for English class. Idk maybe in my mid 20s I‚Äôm not the target audience? I would recommend people watch it, but manage expectations."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Antman is finally a leader and he will get his legacy in the MCU!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"More proof you can't trust critics. This movie was fun, funny and the entire family enjoyed it!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I watched this movie last Sunday. And it met my expectations.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,A whole lot better than Wakanda Forever!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just awful. The only reason I gave the extra 0.5 was I love Paul Rudd. Does not bode well for Phase 5 of the MCU.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I am notoriously ""meh"" about most things.

Strange to me that people seemed to be looking for more ""realistic"" science and deeper character interactions in a comic book movie. Any Marvel or DC movie's scientific explanations are basically 100% Handwavium.

How could Scott and Faith smash up Kang so easily? All Kang's toys were already damaged or broken before they started fighting. It's like asking ""How did Captain America beat up Iron Man"" after Tony's armor was badly damaged. Kang is a scientist, not a scrapper - without his gadgets, he's no real threat at all.

It was a FUN movie; not great arthouse cinema, just a fun movie. As MSTK3K taught us ""‚Ä¶remind yourself it's just a show, you should really just relax."""
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie. Official ""critics"" rated 49%, definitely not in touch with the audience"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great but in one part where Janet uses the disks for growth to enlarge the time ball or what ever it is called couldnt she used those to get out like Scott did? and another thing that cracked me up was Darren as modoc it really made me laugh and it was great how he had a change of heart in the end.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a beautiful movie, and Kang was amazing. I really enjoyed the whole movie!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite it obviously being wacky and absurd, I felt it had a more serious tone than the other ant man's. It felt a lot like Captain America: Civil War where it's more like an Avengers part 1 than an Antman movie. I thought it was better than Antman 2 and actually gives some hope to the Marvel franchise surviving beyond 2025. Kang was ok and left room to grow. Marvel faces an interesting conundrum where nearly all the standalone Multiverse saga movies bombed, so it leaves us once again wanting to watch our familiar friends Antman, Thor, Hulk, Guardians face off against Kang. What are they going to do?"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was so bad, it made me lose faith in our culture. Do not watch it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"All of the fun and excitement you've come to love from the Marvel recipe, with a few new flavors added in. The best in the Ant-Man series and a nice kickoff/setup for phase 5."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,a great introduction for kang & quantum realm
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a really fun, exciting and interesting movie, the quantum relam is a very weird place with a lot of different things including other life forms. Kang is a great villain and I was impressed by how real this and most other marvel movies are. They make you feel like your in the movie 5 out of 5 experience and I'm seeing it for a 2nd time today"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was just pointless! Regret having sat through until the end.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,One of the better movies the critics are wrong on this one and yes critics can review bomb a movie too
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really great movie, I don't understand why it has so bad reviews."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved this movie, great cast and excellent graphics."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ohhh, Marvel really is losing track of what a good history and character development is all about.  Clearly putting Quantity over good quality and storytelling."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantummania is all about kang. Though ant man had limited reach than the other two parts, its all about multiversal war. So on a broader range everyone wants to see how efficient and powerful kang was so that the hype for longer story scores up. All that mattered in the movie was shown in the middle and post credits. 

Coming to the titular characters. They had their fun in the movie with spledid visuals of the depths on the quantum realm. 

Overall I was satisfied as the movie offered what I wanted to see"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was an amazing really well produced movie I don't know why critics are hating on it so much because it's spectacular. The actors and actresses are amazing especially the amazing and charming   Kathryn Newton she is so beautiful and talentedand let's not forget Paul Rudd we always love him  and so is Jonathon Majors I can't wait to see more of him. he is iconic 

All of the cgi and visual effects in the quantum realm were amazing it was just so beautiful and really well done and so magical and futuristic. Also all of the people in the quantum realm were really well designed and thought out i especially liked that little blobby thing that wanted holes so adorable and funny. So yeah there is some good humour in the movie too which is funny and some good action scenes too especially when everyone comes to help defeat Kang.

Talking about Kang I can't wait to see more of him in the MCU and you'll know what I mean once you see the post credit scene the avengers are going to have a hard time.
There is also a scene right at the end of the credits too and that confuses me a little bit I know that Loki was there so maybe something to do with Season 2 of Loki.

So yeah a amazing and beautiful movie that I would definitely recommend watching and  if you can because it makes your experience so much more thrilling and don't forget about the two scenes after the movie finishes. So yeah Marvel have certainly started the year of with a BANG ‚ÄºÔ∏è."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is one great time. My biggest frustration is that it has a lower score than some of the worst marvel movies out there. This wasn't a perfect movie, but are you really going to say the thor the dark world is better than this"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It‚Äôs a decent movie with good action and story telling pretty good 
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what critics are talking about, this movie is great!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst Marvel movie. Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang is good, and Paul Rudd is even good, but otherwise the performances are pretty bad (especially Kathryn Newton's). The special effects tire the eyes, everything is cgi, everything is green screen, it's an absurd visual pollution. The almost non-existent script, Kang is left in the corner, and the characters do not evolve at all, the film ends and it seems that nothing happened."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie deserves greater praise then it is receiving. I find it incredibly rare to encounter a plainly fun and entertaining family movie lately. Not every Marvel movie has to be epic, deep and tragic. Can we just escape the real world for a bit? I super loved this movie and that all five of us got to watch it and be entertained together. Also- really enjoyed almost all of the actors- so refreshing to see all these well-known faces who still do an amazing job."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it. Lots of action and great effects. Paul Rudd is great as Antman!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It's was awesome with so many questions left... But ik marvel got their own theory to explain all the things in future‚ô•Ô∏è
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors was incredible.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was overall a pretty fun movie
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Acting was okay, just bad writing. Marvel's head is bigger than MODOK's these days. Too many alternate storylines and Disney+ shows to keep up with."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is funny on the right level. Fight scenes are great. Kang is amazing!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"If u r a marvel fan you love this movie
Also a comic accurateüëå."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was cute.  Antman movies are just fun and aren't supposed to be thought-provoking or over the top.  I loved Kang.  This was definitely better than the Eternals!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good, not Great but better than the average critic score for sure. "
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good bad guy. Good cast overall. Story is a little weak.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel is starting to feel like the Star Wars movies. All CGI, thin plot and characters. If you are into visual effects, this movie will be right up your alley. But the movie plods around giving very little to care about past the impressive scenery. The biggest issue with the multiverse is that it‚Äôs hard to care about the fate of a character, because even if they die, there‚Äôs another ready to step in. It‚Äôs an interesting premise but it loses its pull after a while. I‚Äôm not sure I will be too impressed with this Phase of the MCU. "
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had nothing wrong with it and I honestly have no complaints. The visuals were absolutely astonishing and the comedy really made the movie have a fun vibe. I admire how it's about a father (Scott) who's just trying to protect his daughter (Cassie). The amount of action this movie has to offer and the crazy adventure that this movie takes us on makes this a great film. I rate it 10/10, the best movie Marvel has made so far."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the finest movie,amazing vfx, amazing story.Don't miss the mid credit and post credit sence.Avengers: The Kang Dynasty just took another big step forward, and Ant-Man talent is involved. Marvel phase 5 begins üî•"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Cinematic we're great, comic book accurate, conversations were sometimes quite childish
Still solid movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"La Pelicula ofrece lo que uno quiere ver, Genera esa espectativa del nacimiento de un nuevo villano mostrando, en parte, Sus origenes y dejando la espectativa que ser√° un villano tremendo..."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are crazy, the movie was actually good lmao.  Nice setup for whats to come."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Don't know why it was rated so low
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a phenomenal film. A lot of action, a great story, an introduction to Kang's powers and technology. Whenever the critics give a low score it's usually the opposite and vice versa. The first two films had a lot more comedy while this was more serious. Definitely worth to see it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and entertaining addition to the marvel universe!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are dumb!  They have no idea what they are talking about when it comes to action and/or sci-fi movies.  It is of course not a perfect movie but it is a must see for sure‚Ä¶
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"8/10. Lots of hype, somewhat of a let down. The visual effects was good however, Jonathan Majors was the phenomenally amazing as Kang. Entertaining flick to say the least."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In Ant-Man's movies the cool thing was that were heist movies, was the story of Scott's life, also with Wasp. In this movie you don't have any of this, what you have is a lot of problems. Everything is too fast, you don't have the time to get attached to the new characters, Scott is useless, anyone could have wore his suit, Wasp is even more useless. The movie should have titled ""Janet and Kang Quantumania"". I really hope that they can bring back the phase 3 level. But movie after movie my hopes are getting lower and lower."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is amazing , what is wrong with you guys , best recently movie from Marvel ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining.  I am shocked to see so many pundits giving it a negative score.  I would agree that this is more a sci-fi movie more than a cbm in a sense, but that isn't a bad thing.  There is plenty of sci-fi in comics after all.  What I loved most is the set up for what is to come.  I'm not sure how it will play out in the long run, but if done right Kang could prove to be a far greater threat than Thanos for the MCU.  Fingers crossed things keep going well.  Now BRING ON THE X-MEN ALREADY!!!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this film. I think (with the possible exception of Tom Holland's Spider-Man) Ant-Man is the only trilogy in the MCU (so far) that has been consistently good
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie with awesome visuals!!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"great movie and a great start to marvel's new phase, Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Major was the stand out...."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The storyline for the movie was good and wove between the comic books and marvel cineuniverse. The script was actually the biggest issue with this movie because there were some blah parts and then parts that just tried way to hard to be funny. I didn‚Äôt love the recasting of Cassie and Kat Newton tried a little bit too hard at times in this movie with the limits in her script (really liked her in Detective Pikachu). The few things the movie really missed on were opportunities to relate Kang to other time lines and to really set the stage for how Kang can control narratives. I think if the writers could have really screwed with viewers if they cast Ty Simpkins (Harley Keener) as a waiter at the end of the movie named ‚ÄúNate‚Äù who was making eye contact with Cassie / Stature. Meaning the Iron Lad has been there the whole time. Then have 11 year old Cassie wake up from this dream of this alternative time line as the original Cassie living in ‚Äúthe blip‚Äù (this was kind of set up by the movie Cassie calling Hank grandpa and acting like her parents and grandparents were at dinner with her, as well as, her blowing off references to her mother) and have the Judy Greer mom talk to her about it and then about what actually happened to Paxton since we still don‚Äôt know. Then maybe mention how Paxton‚Äôs first or last name is Marcus which would fit in with the Scarlet Centurian. Just too many opportunities missed for a mind blowing twist of an ending."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was good, wish the movie didn't take place in the quantum realm the whole movie basically. But overall a good movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I came for Kang, saw it in 4D ; overall pretty fun movie"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel getting back to its roots. This was a fun and funny ride. The action was good the storyline was also good. It didn't push an agenda on you, which is why I believe it's getting panned by critic's and loved by the viewers. If marvel can keep this direction it should be back to normal."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I would say it's best yet from Marvel's this year, definitely not a disappointment. Would recommend it to all the Marvel fans out there."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Filme sem p√© e sem cabe√ßa... Kang nefado e Homem formiga e a Vespa coadjuvantes do pr√≥prio filme.... Q filme triste
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel has redeemed itself with this movie. The last few additions (Thor Love & Thunder and Dr. Strange Metaverse) really ruined it for me. But this movie was entertaining, funny and spot on! Plus we now have MORE bad guys in the mix. Looking forward to the next instalment."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it's good, uhh it is a good movie to watch, it has some CGI issues but it's mid credit and post credit scene is awesome."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is very good but some jokes were bad
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved Ant man and the Wasp Quantumania, it expands the marvel universe perfectly and Jonathan Majors Kang is amazing, the set up for future movies and shows make the movie a must watch for marvel lovers"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best of the 3 ant man films.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The plot is too predictable and childish and all the characters are not well built. I think that with the money that Marvel manages, they could have given us a better product."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie kinda failed to make me care about anything and just visually overwhelming and modok was super ugly overall just very mid
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel is officially DONE. The writing is so bad it's cringe worthy. This isn't antman movie it's just a rushed set up. Kang isn't terrifying AT ALL. Whoever thought of the MODOC idea needs to be fired forever. Marvel is looking like DC nowadays.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was tottaly enjoyable one, comparing to phase 4 this is awesome, get hyped from post credit scene and end credits scene, phase 5 started with good stuff from MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Disney did a great job
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure what the critics were watching, but I felt this movie was pretty good. Loved the special effects, and I thought the action and comedy were spot on. The actor playing Kang the Conqueror is on his way to becoming a major player in Hollywood, with this and Creed 3 coming out; I also thought he would have been a worthy successor to Bosman for Black Panther but I guess they had already booked him for Kang. Make sure you stay till the end because there are two after-credit scenes."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,awesome movie!!! very fun and entertaining üëåüëçüëçüëç
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's great and all but where's luis, like come on yeah I know it's antman and the wasp but still it's not the same."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,marvel did it again. So Bored
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Un villano que le gana a Thor pero no al hombre hormiga ü§®
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Basically nothing of consequence happened, the movie was at points downright dumb, trying to scold and moralize audience hurting the movie overall. 
The only bright side was Johnathan Majors, who tried to carry the movie really hard. 
Visually the movie was pretty and fascinating, but story-wise it lacked any stakes. 
It feels more and more that the villain should be scary not because what the movie shows us he can do and wants to do, but because we should watch another series or read comic books to know him and know what he's capable of. 
Overall this movie was disappointing for me and it was a wake-up point where I wont probably go into cinema to watch another marvel movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie raised more questions about MCU's movies quality than fixing them.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the representation of the time streams! 
I like Michael Douglas, Paul Rudd, Bill Murray, and all the characters!! They were so well represented!!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"They have given us what they thought we needed,but not what we wanted. Same old Disney."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great fun movie. The rattings don't give it justice. For an introductory movie of a new villan character, it gives just enough to make you want more. Seem the critics here failed hard to get that."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Felt like a poorly constructed movie that shut doors on better storylines. The brilliant villain MODOK was laughable and wasted in this movie.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best marvel movie as of recently. The visual are amazing and the jokes had me cracking up. Kang was a superb villain and the ending has me  excited for the MCU's future.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the part where Batman showed up
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I just don't understand why they made it that goofy. The action was subpar. The acting was bad. However, the only things that helped this movie were Michelle, Jonathan, and the scenery."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very satisfying Marvel outting. Ant-Man rocks! Kang is kickin!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Peyton Reed delivers an entertaining but flawed movie. MODOK is another typical comedic marvel character that is shoe-horned in. The relationship between Scott and Cassie is great. Jonathan Majors delivers one of the best Marvel villain performances. The CGI was extremely inconsistent, as was the script."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Superb cgi, great action and comedic timing. Great addition to the MCU."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pure ass! I want my money back. Marvel does not care about their fans after making a killing off of endgame visually the movie was good however the plot was convoluted at the end of the movie the one thing marvel fans always have is questions and they literally had Paul Rudd say life doesn‚Äôt make sense so stop asking questions after wasting an iconic character like modok and kindof killing off Lang but not really I am not looking forward to Lang dynasty marvel and disney will not be getting any more of my money.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a fun romp, I wouldn't say the best of the 3 antman movies but a fun watch. Kang is great. My main criticism is there feels like so much is going on and not enough time to develop the environment, but I'm glad of the 2h run time"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a fun watch and I really enjoyed digging deep into the quantum realm and the creatures down there. Kang was the best thing about the movie but I also loved the performances of all the major players in the story. It's definitely something I'd love to watch again.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super fun, great action!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Was great experience:)
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love the ant man movies and I got to say, this one is one of the best I‚Äôve ever seen. Paul Rudd did an amazing job, it was a totally different side of him we have never seen before anything to protect his daughter and Jonathan Major, man, he was incredible, I got the chills when I saw him play this part a little too well. He obviously knew what he was doing, can‚Äôt wait to see how he changed the MCU."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie. The world building was epic and the villain was great.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just another generic win somehow movie, the villain's strength doesn't make sense and the story is just a push over without any character development.
People just do a favour and spend the money somewhere else rather than watching this thing ( won't even call it a movie, that's how bad it is)."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors kills it as Kang ! (ha see what I did there ?)
Overall great film, cast and visually pleasing movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great lead up to what's coming up, made me feel like I was back in theaters waiting to see what Avengers Infinity War was gonna be like"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't see what all the fuss is about the film being a bad movie!! I thoroughly enjoyed it!! The performances were great, I loved the introduction of Kang the Conqueror, the story was good, and I loved the visual effects! I recommend this to everyone!!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! #itsallconnected
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was very fun and wildly creative but I left the theatre completely un-hyped for seeing Kang vs Avengers in the upcoming movies. Jonathan Majors acting was amazing but based on the outcome of the movie I don't see him as a threat whatsoever to any of the more powerful team. Bit of a letdown tbh.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I get it it's ant man movie not Avengers, hope everyone get this too"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Una pel√≠cula buena aunque le falt√≥ poco para ser excelente
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a pretty solid movie. it does take a couple of large steps away from the original two films, but in a direction that really helps clarify the overall Ant-Man and Wasp story arc. The art direction is absolutely gorgeous. it's like a love note to Kirby and Starlin."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good. This surely opens up the time line on the other multiverse movies
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a nice entertaining Marvel movie.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant, action packed with interesting characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and the new villain is terrifying. I love how it ties into the Loki series on Disney plus."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Somewhat disappointed with the film. Ant-man and the Wasp were virtually irrelevant to the plot and Cassie Lang was only really there to increase the stakes to an unnecessary storyline. The script felt juvenile, formulaic and cheesy (even by MCU standards), and the humour landed only very occasionally. 

The film could easily have been only about Janet and Kang and it would have made a much better movie. Pfeiffer and Majors were powerhouses in this film and I'm very much looking forward to Kang going forward."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Let's talk about the movies that are coming this time, everyone likes or dislikes them in their own way, but the 3rd part of Atman is really worth watching.Acting story or as you say, this movie is capable of keeping the audience locked, except for a few aspects."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very sifi heavy movie but an absolute great start to phase five! Secrets unfold to a story that leads to a great kickstart to the the MCU baddie. Kang is a whole new threat and this movie(including its mid/end credits) gives us an excellent taste of what's to come! Definitely a must see for a marvel fan curious about phase 5 and beyond!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Solid movie, not a masterpiece like some marvel films but a decent start to phase 5. Movie didn't drag and the plot made sense, Kang was the best thing about the film but all cast played their roles perfectly. Definitely recommend for sure!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than Wakanda Forever and Love and Thunder
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was better than what the critics said about it.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As much as I love Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly makes this movie unwatchable. They should have left the Wasp as a supporting character and dropped her into the background. It should have been Ant-man I, II and III or they should have cast a better actress as the Wasp. Hope to see Paul Rudd again in other Marvel Projects minus the bad actress sidekick."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie it doesn't deserve the hate it'd getting
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's new territory for ant man movies and it's really interesting and fun. There's an undercurrent of menace and unease to match the light ant man tone. I like how different it was than I expected.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie all around
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good, lots of action, but  very long! Two more scenes after the credits start to roll - don‚Äôt leave!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand all the negative critic reviews.  It was fun, exciting, and gorgeous!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantum mania, was another great installment to the franchise. It was fun, had really good character development for Scott and Casie as father and daughter.  Kang was an intriguing Villan that really keeps you on the edge of your seat about how the heros will over come him."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Both of the RT ratings so far doesn't tell the real story. Neither it is as good as 
the 84% audience score now as bad as 47% critics score. It Lies somewhere in middle. It's fun and entertaining, gives occasional laughs. But Jonathan Majors, after his entry keeps the interest going till the end, he is just awesome in the movie. Paul Ruud did what's asked of him. Michelle Pfeiffer is brilliant too as Janet though the father daughter relationship of Scott and Cassie didn't hit as much as it should have. MCU needs to take of its CGI more. In first half, in a lot of space CGI inconsistency is visible. The two credit scenes are mind blowing. 

And I really want to know is it the same critics who gave 75% to She Hulk, giving 47% to this one. If yes, Rotten Tomatoes needs to change their critics. You can't be taking money and doing such absurd things then."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Dont believe the critics. Its not a great MCU film, but its enjoyable. Worth a watch."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It is really a great movie specially for future of MCU. Must Watch it.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought I was a really good movie. A great set up for what is about to come. A movie you must see to understand what is about to take place. Plus after credit scene sheds light on the final episode of Loki.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,when you have no story what so ever but you need a way to introduce kang into the mcu.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best way to start phase 5 better than most phase 4 movies.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"this felt like a completely different Antman film compared to the first two. a more serious in tone, stakes and performance. Jonathan Majors absolutely killed it as Kang. his portrayal of the conquerer was regal, stoic, and brutal. for me his performance carried the third film in the Antman trilogy."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Steady action through the whole movie
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Unfortunately cookie-cutter and thin.  seems to be a lot of wasted potential, or potentially a lot left on the cutting room floor.  Kang's best lines were only in the trailer, and I fear the grandiose plan of this Marvel phase may be well off track (at this point).  I get the whole multiverse/ variant thing, but to the casual viewer the big baddie of this phase got beat in his first showing."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and thrilling !
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just kind of sucks. How are we supposed to take Kang seriously after. A Movie like a this. Thanos in no dimension loses to Ant Man. So dumb. 
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Easy to get in and enjoy the movie!!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Marvel installment since Endgame, and it‚Äôs not even close. Both quality writing, plus connection to a broader story. And the most ambitious thing that Marvel has ever done from a VFX perspective. I was totally enthralled with the Quantum Realm."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"tbh, not a perfect movie based on how Kang's being nerfed, but overall i really enjoyed especially with a good CGI"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The combined Ant man, Star Wars, and Tron in one movie. And they did an exceptional job doing it. For like a summer blockbuster. Plenty of action and excitement but hey it won‚Äôt win an Oscar"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! The movie gets into the weeds and this is probably why the critics didn't like it. The character development was already there, so they weren't starting at square one. They took advantage of the quantum realm and had fun with it, then expanded where we left off with the Loki series off Disney+. Fun movie and recommended."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Aa great movie with all things present needed by us as a MCU fans.Paul's comedy timing is excellent and Kang does it's job very well to tell how powerful and dangerous he is.Stiryline is ok but quantum realm is just made for theaters Best in 3D.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was accurate to the comics? No, but that is how all Marvel movies are. It was a good introduction for Kang the Conqueror even that this variant was weak, the movie was entertaining  and my family enjoyed it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant Man 3: Ant man and wasp: quantaumania is a terrific addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and there are several reasons why it's a must-watch for any Marvel fan.

Firstly, Jonathan Majors was simply outstanding as Kang the Conqueror. He brought a certain charisma and complexity to the character that was both thrilling and fascinating to watch. His portrayal of Kang definitely sets up some exciting possibilities for the future of the MCU.

In terms of the film's place within the MCU, it serves as an excellent beginning to Phase 5. The story is well-crafted and engaging, and it sets up several interesting plot threads that will likely play out in the upcoming Marvel movies.

The visuals in Ant Man 3 are truly impressive. From the shrinking and growing effects to the action-packed fight scenes, every moment of the film is a treat for the eyes. The film's visual effects team truly outdid themselves with their work on this film.

And of course, the post-credit scenes are simply spellbinding. Without giving too much away, the scenes set up some exciting developments that are sure to have fans speculating about what's next for the MCU.

Overall, Ant Man 3: Ant man and wasp: quantaumania is a thrilling addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With excellent performances, stunning visuals, and exciting plot developments, it's a film that fans of the MCU won't want to miss."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Ignore the naysayers. This movie was a TREAT. Too many good things to say about it. I haven't enjoyed a Marvel movie this much since Captain Marvel. I loved it.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was so funny lots of action. It was just a good movie!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cgi mess of a movie. Couple funny parts , no real coherent plot to speak of. Paul Rudd takes a back seat in the movie just like Antman 2 , Paul Rudd and Michael Pena were the only reason to see these movies and they removed Michael Pena and neutered Paul Rudd."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie with some really good moments, but the paint by numbers end fights in Marvel movies are becoming very redundant."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I agree that there are some similarities with Star Wars in terms of moving the story and characters to new locations and meet new people. However, Quantumania was very well executed and directed; borne very well on the shoulders of the Ant-Family. Kudos to all of them, especially to up-and-coming young star Kathryn Newton."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Humor, special effects, plot, villain"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Really boring. I managed to stay for half of it. Can I get my time back?
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was overall great movie. Worth it to see it at the movies. Great story, i found out afterwards that this movie sets up the phase of marvel flicks. If that's true then I see a great overall story coming."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie had some good, some bad, but mostly everything they did had no effect on anything."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Not sure why the critics hate this but maybe that's a good thing. Might be the best Ant-Man movie and 3rd best MCU film post-Endgame. Jonathan Majors is great and Paul Rudd is Paul Rudd. Everyone else is kind of good too.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pleasantly surprised with this one. My brother dragged me to it even though I jave heavy superhero fatigue. 

I had a blast with this movie. CGI was amazing and there were times I was dying laughing. Just don't have super high expectations and take it lightly. I was highly impressed."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,GREAT MOVIE WORTH ONE TIME WATCH
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,loved it!!!  Kang (Jonathan Majors) was phenomenal
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,AS EXPECTED  THE KANG NO WORD FOR HIM HE AMAZING.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie. The trailers didn't do this movie any justice, you have to come watch it. Lots of action, a good start for Phase 5. Even better in 4DXüëçüëç"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantamania üèÜ 

""I don't need to win, you just have to lose.""

#AntManAndTheWaspQuantumania¬†follows Ant-Man (Scott Lang) as he find himself trying to fit back into society - and his family, post-blip. 

The family part gets tough when they get swallowed into the Quantam realm, where an evil that has been laying dormant - gets ready to rise and conquer once again. 

Say what you want about the movie as a whole, but Jonathan Majors as Kang was one of the greatest villain performances in a comic book movie I've ever seen. 

He finds a way to carry this entire story on his back, even when he's only mentioned in clouded mystery, the pay off of the ominous unknowing presence throughout the early part of the movie ends up being well worth the wait to meet this god-complex having conqueror. 

Personally, I enjoyed this movie for what it was. 

It's a family adventure, space opera that has an all-time MCU villain performance - who admittedly would've been better served in a more mature story. 

The last batch of Marvel movies have relied heavily on the next generation of heroes saving the day, and though that's a great way to usher in younger fans - the overzealous teenage side-kick relying plot points are starting to take away from the stakes of the movies. 

MCU has levelled up by casting great actors for its villains, but simultaneously end up doing them all (Namor, Gorr) a disservice by not giving them a story worthy of their performance. 

That's me playing devils advocate for the bad reviews that have turned off many of you who have messaged me, from watching this movie. 

I've accepted Marvel for what it is now, and like any movie I just want to enjoy any part of it I can - even if my preference would be having a more mature Winter Solider type of story. 

In the end this time-bending, kaleidoscope trip into the quantam realm is worth it for Jonathan Majors performance as Kang alone, which will give you a taste of what's in store for the future of the MCU.

Enjoy! 

7/10 üé• üçø"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Nothing new or exciting except for the post credits scenes.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect blend of what had made Ant-Man great over the years while elevating the film to an Avenger's level threat. Love the casting for Cassie Lang a well!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible joke of a movie. Longtime marvel fan, just keeps getting more and more disappointing."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Lo que esperaba. Una nueva aventura de los ant-man`s en la que me divert√≠ lo suficiente y me llevo el mejor cameo del MCU a la fecha. La introducci√≥n de Kang con Mayers es exquisita.  A los reviewers: Sepan controlar las expectativas est√° era una pel√≠cula de ant-man NO DE ADVENGERS!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,What a mess! Death of MCU
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Super hero movie folks not gonna terrible but not Batman level either. The villain is good and battle scenes are great. Enjoy the store for what it is
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not really a terrible film, just different from its predecessors, if still the weakest MCU film since Thor: The Dark World. The departure from the lighthearted heist films in favour of what is essentially a live-action adaptation of Rick & Morty - right down to having one of the writers from that show penning the script, albeit a different one than the one from Phase 4 - is somewhat jarring and the fact that none of Scott Lang's buddies return is saddening. And what humour there is fall's flat, arguably being the closest to the stereotypical image MCU detractors have of its sense of humour. Maybe the critical reaction is unsurprising in the grand scheme of things since, in the aftermath of the polarising Phase 4, even if Marvel will be cleaning up their act in the near-future, Quantumania had probably gone too far into production to go through any significant changes. I don't think Ant-Man 3 is bad. The performances are good with Paul Rudd being his good old charismatic self and Jonathan Majors delivering a terrific performance as Kang, the visual effects look passable for the most part, mistreatment controversy notwithstanding + the Spy Kids comparisons aren't without merit since it does feel obvious that the actors are talking to thin air half the time, and the action sequences are fine, if not quite as well-defined or memorable as they were back in the pre-Endgame days. Nice of Marvel to finally figure out a way to bring M.O.D.O.K. in live-action media but he's not exactly a compelling secondary villain here. Probably owing to his nature as a more ridiculous villain. The dodgy appearance doesn't help though I'm not sure how much of it is because of the issues with VFX artists and/or M.O.D.O.K.'s design being difficult to translate to live-action. Wouldn't be surprised if Kevin Feige or any other higher-ups at Marvel Studios did it to get the fans off their back when it came to asking when was this Humpty Dumpty-looking guy was coming to the MCU. Ant-Man 3 - or should that be Ant-Man and the Wasp 2? - gets Phase 5 of the 15-year-old franchise off to a rather bumpy start, nowhere near as good a first impression as WandaVision was for Phase 4, but hopefully, Kevin Feige and co. will take the criticisms to heart and work to remain audience's trust in the brand. Wishing you luck, GOTG3!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It kept my three grandsons attention with all the action.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's really awesome experience. I just live super hero movies. So this is very special to me. It is simply outstanding.
A great start for MARVEL PHASE V, ""Daddy Kang"" is something, and you feel it after watching the movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining.  Kinda stupid but that's why it was entertaining.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very fun movie to watch, or any comic book reader. The action is also top notch. A must see!!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Did not get to see this movie got the tickets at the wrong theater and tried to get a refund , but was denied by Fandango we will never use this service again they were rude and not helpful!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining! Our kids loved it and so did we. Paul Rudd is always fun to watch and had us laughing
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun ride that sets up the rest of this MCU phase. It definitely felt a little rushed and had to get through a lot of exposition, but a solid movie nevertheless. I imagine the upcoming series and movies will solidify what we've been introduced to and take it to Infinity War/Endgame levels."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,If you hate fun then don't see this
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie! It was visually appealing, had as much action as End Game, and found myself laughing quite a bit. Well worth seeing in theaters and I'm eager to see what Marvel has lined up next."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie means the new phase in MCU, but I can't feel the same energy. We don't deserve this quality, the movie cost 200M and it doesn't seem like it... Sad"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning. A great story in itself, an even better story setting up the beginning of Kang. Jonathan Majors is BRIMMING with emotion in a way that truly sets this villain apart from others who have fallen short in the past. That second post credit scene? About damn time. üíö"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,the movie suffered from its low runtime and trying to put a lot of things into a single film. Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror was amazing he honestly carried the movie.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was a fun time. We need more Jonathan Majors/Kang! Jokes were balanced and did not waste down the dramatic scenes. A must watch!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie!!! Huge introduction into phase 5! Does a great job at introducing the new Avengers level threat of Kang!!! Super excited for what is to come!!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,What a mess.   The usual Marvel. Too many jokes. No depth.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Sets up the new villain and what's to come for the avengers and in marvel
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, movie doesn't deserve such a low critic score. Apart from the questionable Modok story line, the movie is composed way better than, for example, Love and Thunder or even Wakanda Forever."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kept the light heartedness of the previous Antman movies with more excitement and adventure.  Was visually great and some fun, laugh out loud moments."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie I definitely reccomend you go watch it for yourself. Did not have as many jokes as the previous ones but it delivered with the introduction of new funny characters, the action and Kang the conqueror. It still kept up with a good amount of comedy I reccomend you watch it and ignore these low scores that critics are given it. Honestly, I do not know how they generate those scores but it was a good movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a great movie.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Good way to kick off the threat of Kangs!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The critics are underrating this. It's a good time at the movies, with good laughs and great effects. If you're gonna make a crazy movie that takes place at the quantum level, it's probably as good as it'll get."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Pretty good movie. Basically a build up to the next big bad Kang. Loved the comedy although I did feel that some of the jokes were meh! 
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was honestly fantastic. It had a few shortcomings in the writing, a few technical mishaps (mostly costuming), and some things that noncomics fans may find off-putting (people unfamiliar with MODOK for example will surely find his face off-putting) but the movie was a great enjoyable experience. 

Jonathan Majors as Kang is huge. His face, his emotions, his sureness in what he is doing and why already makes him a better version than Thanos. In the comics, Thanos was my favorite villain (except for Galactus) but the MCU did a terrible job with him and his story. Kang seems to be sticking to his comic origins and Majors plays him with perfection.

As for the story, it is great in all of it's nuances. It focuses heavily on relationships. Mostly between those of Scott and Cassie, Hank and Janet, Kang and everyone else. However, all of the characterizations in the movie are great, with legitimate understanding and emotional journeys for even minor characters. The Eternals could take many lessons from this, as the weakness of the characters is what ruined that movie.

Compared to other more recent movies, this felt the most like Marvel. Not just the MCU, but Marvel in general. Yes Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a better written, better film. But it is also a grief fest. This movie, while having some sad parts, does not focus on grief. It is truly a story of hope, responsibility and fighting for what you believe in, regardless of whether it makes you the hero or villain. It is also paced perfectly, not trying to stuff too much into a runtime like Multiverse of Madness.

If you read to the end of this, stay to the end of the credits. It's worth it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Buena pel√≠cula, cumple con ser un buen inicio de fase. Sin embargo, no es una pel√≠cula con muchos chistes. Tiene toques muy serios, personajes que no suman ni restan a la fase, pero ufas que post cr√©ditos. MODOK un villano mediocre, la mascota de Kang."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kang can't be a best villian in MCU btw Kang was not even a best villian of Antman...
MODAK was a stereotyped MCU Villain who remember his mistakes in Climax üòê
After ETERNALS I feel sleepy while watching Quantumania...
It's a ripoff of Star Wars and Avatar... 

Title would be QUANTUMANIA(C)..."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I like movie best movie a this year
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"After watching it,
I thought there were some inconsistency in CG.
Some more story info could've been conveyed.
Ofcourse Kang was best thing in this movie n those 2 credits scenes.
Overall it's Good one time watch movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie wasn't bad. Too many timelines to follow. Loved seeing Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeifer continue their roles. Loved the last scene once all credits were done.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the story was good, and it had plenty of action. Kang is a worthy villain in Marvel's next phase."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw it Saturday. I really enjoyed the movie. 
It was a fun Ant-Man ride. The way I cheered for those dang ants.. LOL it was so fun.
Johnathan Majors, oh boy. What a find for the MCU. I can't wait to see more of him.
I wish Luis and Dave were also in the movie.
I will probably go see it again in theaters and I already know this will be a Disney+ multiple rewatch movie just like the other two. 
Go see it if you haven't"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Family focused with very surreal CGI. Villain development was excellent. Once again Marvel give hints of new story line
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"With higher stakes, this Ant Man movie has a herculean task in maintaining its sweetness.  For the most part it succeeds if not getting a bit lost at the end.  The visuals are beautiful, and I wanted more time with the quantum characters (the blob with ""no holes"" is hysterical.)  The signature one-liners are there and the cameo of MODOK is priceless.  Kang has arrived, and so too the MCU Phase Five! Don't let the critics stop you - see it on the big screen!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a really good heart felt epic. It could have used a little more time for character development of Kang. But it finished really well.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors is a brilliant character actor! He  is Kang!!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic segue to the next phase of marvel movies. Dives deeper into the back story of the previous movie's characters while introducing new heroes and a multiversal threat. Clearly not meant to be a stand alone movie but a stepping stone to a new slate of live action comic book adaptations.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Weird sci-fi. Lots of fun. Ant-Man is always great.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid movie!  Felt like Marvel.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie was zany and weird, exactly what I thought Dr Strange would be. Had issues with the lack of real world for more of the cgi generated worlds but Paul Rudd did his best to make you forget about it. The movie still had some charm and laughs but it was also too predictable. If you were looking for a good fun movie experience, go see it. This movie will not win any rewards but it should entertain you."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Really great and awesome visuals!!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible save your money Instead ! Wait til it‚Äôs on Disney. Plus
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,If it wasn't for the appearance of Johnathan Majors and his Kang appearance then I would've probably fell asleep. But it was alright.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,looked great and sounded amazing in IMAX 3D. but that's kinda all it had going for it
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was good. A solid comic book movie that tried to push further into the obscure.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really fun and entertaining and Jonathon Majors was outstanding. Can't wait to see more of Kang. Why are the critics hating so much?
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not even the exceptional acting of Jonathan Majors were able to save this horrendous narrative.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"IT IS GOOD BUT SOME LOOP HOLES ARE THERE AND CGI ,VFX IS NOT UP TO THE MARK"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,very enjoyable movie a little slow in the end but becomes very engaging twords the end
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked this one! I thought the amount of humor was appropriate.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know what the critics are talking about? I went into with low expectations from all and I actually enjoyed this installment of phase 5! It was funny and fun movie!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I seen mixed reviews and was nervous, but I enjoyed the plot. There was some good humor. It steps to the edge of the multiverse without going inside. The multiverse IMO gets too complicated to simply enjoy a superhero movie. This was a fairly straightforward story. I did miss seeing some of the old supporting cast from the first movie, but all in all it was good."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite what others say about this movie, I rather enjoyed it. It's a super hero movie, not a movie that's going to leave you wondering about our place in the Universe or wow you with grand scale special effects that cost more money than it would take to feed and clothe the homeless in the United States, but it's a good movie.

Sit back, relax, and enjoy. I was delightfully entertained."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,it was very enjoyable. had serious moments intermixed with comedy.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was it the greatest MCU movie ever?  No, but it def ranks up there among the top of the middle. Much better than Thor, and 10000x better than eternals. Critics must be smoking something."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Adventure, mystery.  Compelling acting.  Good jokes."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of action and funny moments. The boys ages 6, 9 & 13 loved it!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"its funny, great action scenes and awesome visuals. I highly recommend it"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Visually good. Quantum realm should have been a series journey but ended with too much childish narration spoiled the entire movie experience.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent comic book movie
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This was such a great movie! It told a very important story and was well written!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is very enjoyable. not as bad as many people say. this is a very good start to phase 5 in my opinion, can't wait to look forward to the next project from Marvel"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"RUSHED. Corny. They left out all the supporting actors that made the first two special. How are you going to dog out Luis? I wanted to love it. Haven't missed a Marvel premier yet but they keep pumping out trash after Endgame. Evangeline Lilly,  Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors are too talented for the studio to put this out there. Marvel has completely lost its grit."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang the Conquerer stole the show! Star Wars movie 9 like plot devices but done way better! Takes place in a crazy marvel world! Pure marvel greatness! Hit after hit after hit!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed it! No idea what the critics are talking about but then again I don't care about their opinion on movies, audience score is all I pay attention to."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Was fun ! Little boring at first but Johnathan majors is great. It sets up the next stage. Stay all the way to the end.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie is a blast, the movie has a phenomenal villain in Kang l, who just has this awesome screen presence. Also imo the character of ant man has never been more interesting. Awesome movie for sci-fi fans, the movie has great world building. The movie has great comedy but knows when to be serious, the reason it's not a 5 is some of it can be a bit dumb at times. Also I feel like Modok (sorry if I misspelled)  was handled horribly. My theater had a blast. I hope 
this was helpful incase if you're sceptical going in."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. It was so amazing that I was sitting at the end he of my seat
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Really loved the ride. It was just overall fun to watch. No agenda or preaching. Just a romp in the MCU.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,too much talking without explaining and not much action in this movie thier fights are not entertaining
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie wasn't that bad as the critics says, it's a typical Marvel movie as always with good post credits, I won't say it's the best but it's not that bad either I personally liked the movie and Kang"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I felt it was a gateway to another movies
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fisuals,story and Paul Rudd"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Beautiful visuals. Great story. Great puns. This is an awesome movie to see with your kids. 3D *happy dad noises*
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was awesome,critics don't know what they are watching!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kinda boring and definitely not good enough to restart the whole Marvel universe.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantum Mania is an incredible sequel that exceeded all my expectations. I was blown away by the amazing visual effects, action sequences, and the engaging storyline.

The film manages to balance the perfect amount of humor, heart, and action. The characters are all well-developed, and the performances by the cast, including Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Douglas, are fantastic. I particularly loved the chemistry between the lead actors, and the way they complement each other's strengths and weaknesses.

The movie's plot is engaging and filled with unexpected twists and turns, which kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. I was fascinated by the concept of quantum mechanics, and the way it was portrayed in the film was truly amazing.

The visual effects are out of this world, and the action scenes are incredibly well-choreographed. The film's score is also outstanding, and it adds to the overall excitement and tension of the movie.

Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantum Mania is an incredibly entertaining film that is a must-see for any Marvel fan. I can't wait to see what the future holds for these characters and this universe. Highly recommended!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The media critics clearly have lost there collective minds. The CGI is great, the humor is present....although not perfect, this is an excellent setup for the next phase. Seriously, these movies can't all be Endgame like. Overall, an impressive introduction to the next Avengers nemesis."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie is very entertaining and I think good comeback from marvel
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,most of it was boring and dragged out
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,The story flowed really well. It was the Michelle Phifer story. Jonathan majors was definitely on his acting thang. Michael Douglas was really a cool character. The story was over all okay. You can see what they are trying to set up.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great effects and story! Enjoyed every single moment
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! I knew it would be good when the critics trashed it.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was a watered down version of Dr Strange in the multi-verse but only because the dialogue between Ant Man and his daughter really wasnt believable.  Considering the seriousness of the situation and who they were dealing with I thought there was too much comic relief. So am good with not seeing it again.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,It‚Äòs a disaster. I was hoping for the heros to die.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed it. Good build up for Kang 
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Really poor plot, you cannot add ""Quantum"" and ""Multiverse"" to a script and think that makes up for spending money on CGI rather than plot and acting.
What is the point of Kang? On this showing not much, bring back Thanos
Modock is a badly acted/scripted joke....and his CGI is poor. Why is he in the movie?
I left before end credit scenes.
Worst of all where was Paul Rudds humour? 
I think I may have been generous with the star ratting, please get back to Avengers and Endgame quality script quality"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great marvel movie. A good start to phase 5, leaves you excited to see whats coming next with Kang."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It felt like a Star Wars rip-off from the costumes (the big bad has the same pan up camera shot from the black boots and matching cape), dialogue (freedom fighters = Rebel Alliance), scenes (Olga's Cantina-like bar scene, Palpatine in the Senate floating), and alien life forms. There was humor, unexpected surprise appearance and a good opening/ending with the theme from Welcome Back, Kotter. Looking forward to Loki coming back and explaining further."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It does raise some questions on plot holes but they can easily be explained. The movies has a very slow pace but worth the build up. So funny too in an obvious way most of the time but some joke just come out of no where. Fun movie! Great marvel film!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's an average movie that has way too much CGI. Yes, I know it's a superhero movie and superheroes are not real. Yes, I know it takes place in the ""Quantum Realm"" so CGI is needed for that. BUT! It's just too much. It needs a sense of balance between the fantasy of the Marvel universe and the real world. This was more of a cartoon than a movie. The acting was fine but Marvel needs to rein in the special effects a little before it embarrasses them."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very fun science fiction film that establishes Kang as the next great villain of the MCU.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I had heard the negative reviews going in. Let me just say, it wasn't as bad as Thor or The Eternals. it wasn't great but it wasn't horrible either. MODOK's cgi was awful. it really contrasted with the cgi of everything else. The first end credit scene did not leave me looking forward to anything either."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great family fun!!! The humor was all over the place which was great and Jonathan Majors as Kang was excellent!!!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Great set up for the next phase. Not sure why the critics done like this‚Ä¶it‚Äôs classic antman and marvel!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pretty disappointing
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know why people don't like it, i mean the jokes maybe aren't great but the movie, the action, the drama, the expectations, were ON POINT."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Definitely an Ant-Man movie‚ù§Ô∏è
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,The end was a bit better than the beginning.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"PROS:
VERY well done effects. 

CONS: 
It didn't really feel like a movie, more like a reallllly long trailer for a movie.
Important side characters didn't get a explanation for backstory. 
Internal guideline to plot. (The character had time to argue with her family, but zero time to just say ""A bad guy I trapped here is mad and trying to kill us."")

RANT: 
Dude, you built up the King character as conquerer of multiverses, destroyed timelines, then loses to a bunch of mech-ants?"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed the action. It started fast I felt.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Really fun movie with some great action sequences. Ignore the critics, if you like these movies you'll like this one."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable, but a lot of stuff feels like it happens because the plot wants it to happen."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman 3 quantumania is a good Marvel movie. Is it Black Panther/Thor Ragnarok/Captain America/endgame amazing?
No. But it is worth the price of admission. I enjoyed it."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Weak story. Some how everyone is in the right place at the right time. A couple people were able to break Kang's super advanced systems and rally countless people and species into defeating the vast army created to conquer the multiverse. The worst character was Cassie. She was so out of place and unbelievable. Kang was the only character and actor I enjoyed. Need more Jonathan Majors.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really fun and enjoyable movie with some good scenes, and better fan service.  Really exciting to see how they introduced Kang and see where they take him."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a fun and action packed ride. Only only complaint Kang wasn't as powerful as he should be.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sad to see. The movie doesn't make sense, at all! I think Disney needs to fire the writers. Their movies are getting progressively worse."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great show! Two extra scenes through the credits‚Ä¶ hope you have seen Loki on Disney Plus!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked the introduction of new characters but, I feel the pace of the movie was a bit prolonged."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Plenty of your typical Ant-Man humor and vibe, but great action and story. Definitely will be watching this again."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I personally enjoyed this movie. It had me feeling like I'm watching phase 2 or 3. It was goofy but not as goofy people say it is and takes itself serious when it needs to. The storyline was good and I absolutely love the characters including Paul Rudd's Antman and Jonathan Majors's Kang. My only problem is that I wish they came strong with a climax. That's where I think the MCU drops the ball. We need those memorable final fight/battle scenes that phase 1-3 gave us. Over overall the movie was Great and one I've rewatched 3 times. I can say Antman has a solid trilogy for which I can't say for 2 of the Big 3 Avengers: Iron Man and Thor.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was actually very interesting
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best MCU film since Endgame!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie very much.  Actors have good chemistry and the mild humor was so much better than Thor: Love and Thunder, which was just corny, silly and frequently stupid.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was visually stunning , which will look awsome at home in 4k(UHD). Can't wait to pick up the 4k disc."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a fantastic addition to the third installment of the series and the beginning of Phase 5! I love how different it is from the first two Ant-Man films; it's a combination of a Marvel movie with Star Wars. I thought that was pretty cool! I thought everyone was amazing, but especially Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror, and I can't wait for more of him in future content. And those two end-credit scenes have got me excited for what's to come!¬†

People are insane not giving this movie a good review. This film absolutely DOES NOT deserve a rotten score. It was awesome! I don't understand these critics. Their scoring is appalling. I never trust Rotten Tomatoes or critics in general anyway. I mean, look at the difference between their score and the audience's score; that says a lot. I go in and I'm my own judge, and I enjoy the hell out of these films (or even shows)! People focus too much on ratings instead of enjoying themselves, especially when you go see a movie on the big screen, and that's the problem. Personally, I think if you're not a fan of superheroes and their content, your critique towards them isn't going to be the greatest or very fair, to be honest, which is sad. 

I think the issue is that after Endgame, I think many people think that every movie going forward is going to be Endgame level. And most likely it won't be until the next Endgame level film actually happens. I'm just so sick and tired of the negativity towards Phase 4 and now Ant-Man 3. And makes no sense to me. And people talking ill of Marvel in general when, to me, their content has been beyond incredible (I don't want to tear it down, I still enjoyed it, but my only issue has been with Thor: Love & Thunder because they made it way too funny when it shouldn't have been). I just don't understand the hate; it baffles me! It's uncalled for, and people are way too harsh. Personally, I love Phase 4. Actually, I love all the Phases, but Phases 3 and 4 have been my most favorites so far, to be honest. I love the introduction of newer characters and moving forward from what we've previously seen and other characters we've come to know and love. I'm always ready for new storylines and for new characters to finally join the Marvel family. 

To be honest, in my opinion, there are always positive things to take away from these movies and even the shows that keep the story and the characters moving forward and fresh and new, especially into future content. And it's sad when people don't see that; they rather focus on the negative. Most of the time, there is not much negativity to talk about. People are just mean, rude, negative, and nitpicky. And you could tell when they're hating just to hate. 

Sometimes I think that they should get rid of the scoring system, especially when critics and people in general aren't being fair with their reviews and ratings. And unfortunately, you have audience members who sadly listen to these critiques and ratings, but don't form their own opinions and judgments for themselves upon viewing these movies, or even shows, for that matter.¬†Go enjoy this great film on the big screen, you won't regret it!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I love Marvel movies. This one was fun to watch. Ant Man has never been my favorite but I still really liked it. I feel like it was well done.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"My family had an absolute ball! Paul Rudd is insanely suited (no pun intended) for this role. The 3d effects were visually rich & appealing and well worth the cost.The story was an enjoyable blend of action, science fiction and comedy. Bill Murray's cameo was deliciously devilish (that creature inhabiting drink satisfyingly get it's revenge), and as always, Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas embodied their roles as the ultimate Bass Ass Parents. Our audience was cheering, laughing and rooting for everyone to be heroes, and not be A Dick. It's an escapist romp, so enjoy it for what it is!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A pretty good movie unless you have any context of marvel. Antagonists were severely nerfed, to a point that it ruined the movie, and there were more dislikable characterd than likeable ones."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This was better than Thor Love and thunder.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great building block for future movies. I can't wait to see where the character goes with Jonathan Majors at the helm.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Seeing it on my late father‚Äôs birthday made the father daughter plot line hurt more but also felt right
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film isn't epic or horrible. It's simply a good movie. I enjoyed it very much. Every member of the ""ant family"" had their moment and kang was great. The mid credit scene really sets kang up nice, If you know your comic books"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the movie. Thought it had great visual sequences and the story was on par with the other Ant man movies.  If you don't like ant man, you won't like this.   Had more depth I'd say than the others.  Loss and heart both present.  Great characters.   Good early entry into phase 5, and set up the foreboding to expect."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The villain was amazing. Very dynamic. Cannot wait to see how it develops in the future.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,My whole family loved this movie.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang is fantastic! All acting is great, just felt a little in all-over"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. Way better than the second Ant-Man movie. As a long time comic reader I really loved Kang and the Quantum realm being brought to life. Great build up for the MCU's next big villain.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!! People compare always compare these movies to past Marvel films, but if you look at this as the 3RD ANT MAN MOVIE‚Ä¶. THIS WAS SPECTACULAR!!!!!!!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun for the entire family! We watched the movie on President's Day and had a great time. The movie is true to the comedy of the other Antman installments and there was plenty of action to keep my youngest child engaged. Lots of CGI in the Quantum realm which, at times, was a bit overstimulating, but if you enjoyed the previous Antman movies you should really like this one. Paul Rudd doesn't disappoint!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"REALLY GOOD, made me laugh a lot, good story and characters."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, Kang is a beast! 2 End Scenes! Best Marvel Movie in a minute!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,True marvel fans like myself will love this movie. Visually stunning. And Kang is gonna amaze you.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wouldn't necessarily say it was bad, but it was rather unremarkable and definitely a disappointment considering how much they had to work with and just squandered. I would love to see another timeline's version of this movie, especially another timeline's script; one that honed in more on what could've been compelling -- the Scott/Janet, not there for their kid parallels and being tempted by a devil's bargain with a more manipulative Kang -- cut out what was ultimately pointless and just ate up screen time that could've been better invested elsewhere -- everyone in the Quantum Realm other than Kang -- and kept what worked so well in the previous Ant-man movies -- humor, Luis, Maggie and Paxton, and a lot more heart and emotion than what we got here."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Ant-Man of the 3. Kang stole the show.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,best Marvel movie in awhile - has that phase 3 feel - great job!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, awesome characters! SO MANY ANTS!!!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Quantumania was all mania and no quantum. It was the worst Marvel film of all time. I tried to like it. I love these movies and I'm amazed at the brilliance of their storylines over so many series.

Something has gone horribly wrong with this movie and this portends an uncertain future. Wasting the talents of Jonathan Majors, Paul Rudd, and Michelle Pfeiffer is bad enough, but Evangeline Lily's smirk throughout the film forecasted that even the actors knew how terrible this was. 

There will be a moment when even die-hard fans will no longer shell out money to feel duped into wasting their time on the most deus ex machina ending (ants via remote control) of the series."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ummm, I left before it was even over lol. It was so bad and I don't like the new Cassie. The plot was completely out of pocket. To Paul Rudd, I'm sorry, your a great actor and this wasn't a reflection of that."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Beautiful special effects with a tedious, lackluster story, lacking interest, lacking excitement, lacking anything to keep one's involvement.  It's like watching some dull slide show.  No interest in the characters. Nothing.  Worse than 'Eternals.'"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Hilarious movie with some awesome comedic points and hella acting by Jonathan Majors! Enjoyed it thoroughly.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and full of action. Kang was awesome
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall good movie, I took my 13, 10 and 8 year old boys. They too enjoyed the movie. I liked the movie and would recommend it for others to see. I thought it was a little predictable."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Really a poor character and all around blah introduction to the quantum stuff. And even the D Box motion was off most the time for story telling. Nap movie to nap to.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"About time we see a villain that has multi personalities and a solid performance. Great casting and unestimated 
potential. Everyone expects above level Marvel movies but the point of Ant Man is the quantum realm. Stop expecting so much for movies that get over hyped. Great movie just be open minded to the what the point of the movie üé¨ is for."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No Luis, terrible movie"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun movie setting up phase five. The script could have been and should have been better but nonetheless it's an action packed and sometime funny movie.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Muito bom o filme eu e minha filha gostou muito do filme parab√©ns fizeram um √≥timo trabalho
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fun. It was goofy. Almost everybody crushed their roles. I have complaints but they're small. The biggest one for me is what I'd call the Dementor type naming convention from Prisoner of Azkaban. We all know who the bad guy is. Just say his name it isn't a big surprise.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, fast paced action, pretty funny. I have no idea what all the negative reviews are about."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie has a good 6 above average but it def wasn‚Äôt good for a marvel movie, regardless if endgame/Infinity war came out, we all know marvel could make good movies, this movie is more of a Comedy movie then a actual action movie obviously ik it‚Äôs supposed to be both but yeah it reminds me of love and thunder too much, it‚Äôs just too much jokes not enough Action tbh, Kang without a doubt was the highlight of the movie and carried the movie on his back i wonder if his back hurts, should u watch this movie with ur family/friends yeah ig but don‚Äôt expect to much, it‚Äôs a good movie tho i‚Äôll give it a 6-7/10 there was little to no character development in the movie, This Variant of Kang was just wasted tbh, ‚Äúit was for build up to next movies‚Äù regardless if it is or not the movie should still be good, way better then what it is, certain things were just there and just brushed off which was dumb, i was expected good development from Ant man himself, but he got little to known tbh, idk how his daughter managed to learn so much in 5yrs just off a book, that is also crazy too me, but kang without a doubt carried this movie, he did a beautiful job props too him, & the end credits were good we got to see the variants of kang, but long story short ues u should watch the movie and try to build ur own opinion on the movie but that was just my take on it. All i wish is that This entire marvel phase isn‚Äôt like this tho, or it will be worse then the one before this. but u should watch it with ur family/friends to like i said build ur own opinion on it, but soild movie i wouldn‚Äôt rewatch it tho ngl. but yeah."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just generally disappointing and boring.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie had amazing special effects compared to phase 4 projects really explained Kangs storyline and this movie had good humor but not too much where is was a joke like Thor love and thunder I believe this movie to be better than Antman and the wasp I recommend watching it
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you're a Syfy and a Marvel fan like me, this is a must see!  Definitely top 10 MCU of all time."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Special effects great.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"For a fan of the Marvel Universe, this movie propels the high-level story forward with an exciting new and complex antagonist. In terms of tone, it is a combination of the light Ant-Man comedy and action with the menacing and time-bending tone from the end of the Loki television series. Alas, for viewers who are not up-to-date with the Marvel series, the lack of back-story could be distracting (evidenced by the poor critical reviews)."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a fun movie. My wife isn't the biggest fan of Marvel movies and she actually stayed awake for the whole thing
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another entry into the MCU with virtually no story, a ton of CG (often of low quality), and a lackluster set of preferences. 

The only part of this movie that matters are the end credits scenes."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,The Conqueror is coming and he is coming for the entire multiverse
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Always loved a marvel movie I can‚Äôt wait to see more of kang
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The third installment of Ant Man still manages to bring the moments of levity that it's known for even in the face of raised stakes and some intense situations. Moviegoers are introduced to Kang and are almost immediately made to understand his power and the threat that he can be. As with any Marvel movie there are some plot holes but nothing so glaring that it takes you out of the movie and can't be looked past. It's not Marvel's best but it absolutely is an enjoyable ride
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was GREAT. Very entertaining. Fabulous addition.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ignore the critics, it was a lot of fun."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a very good movie. My son and I laugh the whole movie
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think everyone is being too hard on this movie. I liked the story and wow, Jonathan Majors. I hope we get a lot more Kang. "
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie, perfect end to the trilogy! It was also a great debut for Kang to the movie side of the MCU."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I actually really do enjoy the Ant-Man movies! I don't think they're amazing, but they are fun rides nonetheless. And with the amount of hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania I was certain that it would be a sure fire hit. And while it's not bad, it's not that great either.
To be fair, the acting is good, the action is fun, most of the effects are really well done, and Kang practically carries the movie! 
But the movie feels very rushed, the comedy's not very good, and most of the characters and environments feel wasted. 
I don't hate the movie, and the good things in it are really great. It's just that the rest of the film is either so stupid or so standard that the film leaves no impact. Mediocre is never a word you want to use when describing a Marvel movie, but this one comes close."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining movie for the family. Amazing graphics. Must see on big screen!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. There are some interesting/strange writing choices but overall a good film.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,A great marvel movie experience that didnt either out like so many other off the the third in series.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Slow start then was entertaining!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great New Villain, good performances all around. Tone changes were a little jarring, but Ant-Man vs Kang the Conqueror makes sense there'd be some clashing."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I REALLY enjoyed it!  It keeps all of the humor and action of the previous instalments while adding interesting new characters and locations.  I loved Kang and can't wait to see what they do with all of his variants in future films.  I hope people give it a chance regardless of what the critics are saying because it's one of my favorite recent marvel movies.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome visuals great story, super entertaining."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The visuals on this movie were spectacular.  The story drags a little in places, but overall weel worth the time!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was really good, I don't see why all the critics hate it. Then again they seem to like more garbage now a days. Overall I would recommend it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie put everything together on Kang and who he is and how they set it up. What i didn‚Äôt like, was these two men talking THE WHOLE MOVIE!!!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely not the same Ant-Man and Wasp we've seen.  Much more of a Star Wars vibe.  Scott's still Scott but Kang is scary
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Forget the paid reviewers who either have an agenda against Marvel or are simply suffering from multiverse-fatigue. 

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was a fantastic journey with a captivating storyline with cast of characters who have great chemistry. The CGI wasn't Avatar-level but it was clean and never felt outside of the scope of an alternate universe. 

It seems a lot of ""professional"" reviewers expected to see a smaller scale movie and can't cope with the fact that this isn't meant to be that. Oh well! We loved it and plan to see it again once the audiences die down a bit."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are smoking crack. I saw it on IMAX 3D. Super fun movie. Kang The Conquer is bad ass. Stay till all the credits are done üëçüëç
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Average forgettable Marvel. Didn't really progress the MCU. Characters and effects 7/10. 
Story 4/10"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,3D special effects were great!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang  was awesome while Cassie should have had a lessor role. she almost ruined the movie for me
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this was really good!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Much better than the last several Marvel movies. I do feel like it would of been better if it wasn't being used to launch the next phase and let it just be its own thing.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Favorite Ant-man movie BY FAR
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,More computer work than acting
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed film!  Very CGI heavy production, but overall immersed audience in a realm of fantasy and adventure.  Definitely not as many funny encounters / lines as seen in original Ant-man and the Wasp, but this movie is definitely worthy seeing!  Can't wait for the next installments in the Marvel Universe."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a good movie, especially after the last marvel shows/movies that have come out."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the humor and action the movie had. Does not deserve the hate or bad reviews it is getting. Totally recommend!!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't get the critics on this one. I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was good, the visual effects were impressive, the action scenes were great, the story was fast, and it sets up the Kang Wars. I enjoyed this movie more than any of the recent Marvel movies."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Way too much redundant, boring technological stuff.  Animation was great, though.  Completely unnecessary stuff inserted that was not appropriate for kids such as one very deliberately pronounced curse, some sexual innuendos.  Although ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù was ascribed to it, there was only one place that audience laughed."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wonderful special effects, pretty good story, good sound tract, quality actor and actresses"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good i like everything i didn't like some little things but i didn't get bored was really good i got to say that is maybe the best marvel movie of phase 5
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely one of Marvel's best trilogy series. Jonathan Majors shows his range once again as Kang. Paul Rudd is solid as always. My only knock is I wish we still had some of the side characters, definitely at least Luis but most of the movie was focus in the Quantum realm. Not sure how yup it critics rated this movie so slow compared to the actual fan rating. Great start to Phase 5."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Do not listen to the critics on this movie saying it was a dumpster fire. Far from it. That being said, it was also far from great. Paul Rudd is phenomenal as always, Jonathan Majors as ""The Conqueror"" makes you excited for what's to come from Kang. On the downside, This movie left a lot on the table and felt messy at times. MCUs comedic repertoire also needs some serious fine-tuning because it seems like a constant issue in every new release."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Extremely entertaining! Very well written script.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was really good with some comedic relief. Also I LOVE Paul Rudd, and Jonathan Majors."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Goodbye to yet another chapter in the aggressively mediocre chapter book that is the MCU. While this movie in and of itself wasn't particularly awful, like nearly every modicum of entertainment Marvel Studios has given us since Endgame, this is another forgettable demonstration of Marvel's apparent ""quantity over quality"" strategy. The VFX, as always, are disappointing. There is no cohesion to the Quantum realm. Why is anything there? I don't know. To be fair, I don't care. Who are the Quantum realm characters? I don't know. Don't care. There was zero character development. Every character - except perhaps Janet - is exactly the same as at the beginning of the movie. Not only that, but this movie doesn't tread any new ground that the Loki show (one of the few great things we've gotten in the past couple of years from Marvel) hasn't already. So what's the point? There isn't one. If I hadn't seen this movie, I'd haven't had missed anything. I expect more from Marvel at this point. They've been making these movies for fifteen years now. Step it up."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Typical plot but everyone loves Paul Rudd !! Ants rule
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't believe these so called critics. The marvel movies are expanding its characters and scenarios like the comic books, yes. not everything is the same but seeing these movies come to life excites the kid in me. The movie started off at a decent pace and set you up right away for a wild ride and it delivered. The villain being revealed was a huge mark for this Era of marvel and I hope they continue to make it as epic as the Thanos saga."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,very lighthearted and fantastic special effects
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was like watching transformers 2
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good introduction to the newest big bad of the MCU. not a perfect movie but still a fun time. can't wait to see more of Jonathan Majors in the future
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Missing the great humor from the prior movies.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Critic's were definitely wrong on this one. Not sure what they are looking for in a Marvel movie. If you want a good story, great villain, an escape from reality, this is the movie to see. Is it Citizen Kane? Nope. But not trying to be. One of those situations where critics maybe take things too seriously"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I really enjoyed it. I thought some parts were rushed but overall good movie.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Screw the critics. This movie isn't for them, it's for the fans. After all of these years marvel is finally, weird.. and that's a great thing. Visually beautiful, and I personally love the story, the humor and the action. And as most marvel movies, great setup for bigger things to come"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is terrible and another chapter of the failure of the M She U. Save your money and skip this one.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved this movie! Went to 3D with my daughter. It was worth every damn penny!   I love this theater and the employees are very helpful!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This new entry breathes life back into a well-loved franchise and checks many boxes. Plenty of call backs, some surprises, advancement of the phase 4 storyline, and an appreciated amount of Scott Lang self deprecation. Great movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Story makes 0 sense. Script is terrible. Humor ruins multiple scenes throughout the movie. Did I say the script was terrible?
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed. Good message. Enjoyed seeing the same cast.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this really focused on the family dynamics, and the strength of their bonds in a fantastical world. I loved it!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,3rd times the charm for Ant-Man! Outstanding visuals‚Ä¶ everyone gets to shine‚Ä¶ Kang is the baddie we need right now and an amazing kick off to the next phase. MAKE MINE MARVEL!!!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The biggest problem with the 3rd Ant-Man movie is that there is no Michael Pe√±a. I also liked that the first two movies were basically fun standalone movies that did not have galactic / universe destruction stakes. That said, this was a fun movie that I recommend and will watch again."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Since ""End Game"" with a few exceptions, the MCU has put out one disappointing thing after another, Exceptions ( Wanda Vision, Loki, Shang Chi) Shang Chi had a few problems but was still a great outing. Even ""No way home"" was a good movie but not for the reasons we expected. I think they started using every show and every movie as an ""Easter egg"" fest, cameo opportunity, or just to set up ""the next thing"" . They stopped telling great stories for everyone, they forgot what made the first few phases successful. Great stories with character development, arcs and villains and characters with sympathetic back stories. Please do better. We know you understand what we want because you make better trailers than movies, make the movies as good as trailers hype them up to be."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Literally worlds better than Thor: Love and Thunder. It surpassed any Marvel Disney+ show. The Ant Man family was great, as well as Jonathan Majors. Don't go by the critics' scores. A great introduction to Kang."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,A great ride!!!! Emotionally gripping with great action! More Kang!!!
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The creative team's lack of imagination is immensely ridiculous. The fimle fails to capitalize on its oddities even as comic relief, MODOK/Darren jokes are used to exhaustion, and we have nothing else but hole jokes‚Ä¶terrible"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"If the critics don't like it, it must be good. Can't wait to watch it üòÄ"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una pel√≠cula bastante buena, no tenia expectativas de esta pel√≠cula y termine sorprendido, tremenda obra"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,An entertaining ride ... I always enjoy michelle Pfeiffer
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was fine, just lacked all stakes and tension."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was an entertaining movie but was too reminiscent of Tron Legacy.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Ant Man movie, moves forward the MCU story and sets up the next phase. Probably top 70% of MCU movies so far."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"As usual, Paul Rudd was awesome! I thought it was very well cast.  It was the right amount of humor at the right times. I loved the thought-provoking ending."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. Ignore the critics....  go have fun and watch the movie.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible. I dont know what Marvel is thinking. I think I'm done giving them money.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"So much MCU fun! Great VFX, drama and action!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang was amazing but i wanted more of him 
And jonathan majors was amazing"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Only good thing was kang
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Better but the infinity saga will be what is remembered. Kang steal this movie good action light humor. A little to much language for an Antman movie but Jonathan Majors saves a movie that would have been a 2 to 3 star film without him. Lets see if Kang can save the MCU from a horrible phase 4?
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"1. Marvel Studios turned into a parody of itself.
2. Ridiculous how they turned Cassie (an empathetic and lovable character in the first two movies) into a stupid and insufferable (communist) hooker.
3. What they did to MODOK... absolute garbage ending.
4. Half star extra because I liked the credits."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,i think it is a overhated mvie
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was very funny and had great computer animation characters.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything I hoped and wanted it to be. I was especially impressed with MODOK. MODOK is such a difficult character to translate to the screen and they did an amazing job with it.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Interesting plot and characters. CGI could have been better especially on MODOK. Speaking of MODOK I am disappointed in his character development there was still way more of his character to explore. Kang was amazing Johnathan Majors was amazing. Ending was sub-par I can think of a few different ways I could have been better like Ant'Man actually getting stuck in the quantum realm. Over all I still had fun watching it and would watch it again.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dear Lord Satan, just stop Disney's evil. Just absolutely awful. But if cringe turns you on, give it a watch."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The film is a great kick-off to Phase 5. It jumps around a lot in the first 1/3 of the film. but once it settles in, it‚Äôs a great storyline. The title is a bit of a misnomer, as it‚Äôs less about The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly is a bit underused) and more about setting up Cassie Lang for her future in the MCU. Definitely more action and less humor than previous Ant-Man films, but I was riveted‚Äîespecially as the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Kang is revealed more and more throughout the film."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It wasnt perfect but its a farcry from the criticisms ive heard not bad Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors killed their roles.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining, awesome family movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's not perfect. It has a couple of plot holes, just like every MCU film. The plot is stretched out to fill up the two hour running time, but it definitely could have been shorter.
Having said that, I think it was one of the funnest movies since No Way Home. I've enjoyed the other MCU movies since NWH, but not as much as I enjoyed this one. I have no intentions to rewatch BP2, The Eternals, or DS2, but I definitely want to rewatch this film as soon as it hits D+. Jonathan Majors truly elevates this film, and I'd watch it again just to watch him work again."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Spoiler review-So looking at the trailers they looked very promising and looked visual amazing.Then i watched the movie and....It was pretty bad.I will do the good things about this movie first so lets go.The movie looks visual great the backgrounds and the scenery looks so good the beginning of the movie looked gorgeous the blue sky looked really cool.The whole quantumania just looks so dope.A other good thing about it is Kang played as Jonathan majors he is menacing and cool at the same time and the acting with it even better.He is pretty much the best part of the film and other cast are fine they get a laugh once in a while.Other good thing is ant man versus kang That was a very good fight i wanted that to go on longer then it did.That's all the good stuff now the bad stuff in the film.The movie is not that funny i mean like there are some funny stuff but besides that is not a funny film.I'm sorry but janet van dyne was getting on my nerves she would not tell them anything i know she didn't want anything to happen to them but it came off annoying a little.This movie really does not feel like a ant man movie i know they are trying to build up the new big bad but its a ant man movie i needed a bit more of that.Bill murray is only in the film for like 8 minutes and then dies.Its just slightly disappointing a little bit.5.510
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A film can be a lot of things... Scary, Exciting, Fun, Funny, Enjoyable, Sad, Odd, Special, Unique, Beautiful, and I ran out of adjectives, but you get the idea. This film is so unbelievably mad that I think it manages to reach a level of pure enjoyment. While it may not be for everyone, the wacky world and deadpan humor of [Ant-Man and The Wasp] Quantumania allows an otherwise mediocre affair to transform into a captivating yet bizarre adventure."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great effects...first time watching a 3D movie...AWESOME
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely exceeded my expectations. Heard so many ""bad"" things going into the movie but it turned out to be amazing. Best marvel movie since Infinity War! so well done. Poor Cassie had some bad lines but the pacing was incredible (Except for a little bit in the middle) Ending 10/10 so well done. Fist time in a while where an mcu movie had a good ending. Modok was so fantastic."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,what an amazing movie
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It gave us some of the comedy, more drama and a great introduction to Kang (Jonathan Majors is excellent in the role). Really liked seeing Cassie suit up as well."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite the critics' reviews, I really liked this movie. Not as great as some of the other more ""classic"" Marvel movies but entertaining nonetheless. I'm a huge Marvel fan and I thought this movie was fun, funny and didn't drag on. At just 2 hours, it's just enough to keep you entertained throughout."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. It was amazing. Kang was such a badass and was so cool. All of the characters were great. Cassie was kind of annoying but overall she was ok. I highly recommend this movie.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pelicula esta muy padre kang esta perro,buena comedia,criticos si nos les gusta hagan sus peliculas"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"No estuvo tan mal, me entretuvo y me gusto el mundo, ""algunos"" de los personajes, Y KANG, pero el guion, ay.

Los primeros 10 min son apresurados, Modok fue SUPERDESPERDICIADO, y las decisiones que el guion tomo no fueron de las mejores.

Agresivamente okey."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,i loved the plot twists üòÇ
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Better than average great special effects and plenty of action
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was intriguing and engaging. Paul Rudd was humorous as usually but he also got serious in some parts.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"very cool visuals ‚Ä¶ the Quantum realm was so different to others MCU places , The (spoilers) ‚Ä¶Hank's ants saving the day was really good scene ‚Ä¶ kang is a very good villain  for the future MCU"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film dives into the epic conclusion on the Ant-man Trilogy,  giving fans the usual level of humor associated with the series and although this film separates itself from the usual heist storyline of the ant-man films, it's still an enjoyable film. The film is not perfect, but it definitely one that you should watch for all MCU fans. The incredible portrayal of Kang, by Jonathan Majors excites you for his future in the MCU. The mid and post-credit scenes are interesting choices that leave you wondering where they'll take the MCU down the line. I saw the movie twice before deciding on my opinion. The critics have really hated on this movie, when there are way worse entries in the MCU that are rated much higher. I'd say this movie is at par with Thor: Ragnarok or Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, in sense of story structure and humor. I highly recommend watching this outing to get your own opinion rather than reading all the reviews ahead of time!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This is Marvels return to form from its previous three outings!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Quite enjoyed the movie. Like previous Antman films it has a lot of laughs. Kang is a very strong villain and I think he will be a great villain in the future of the Multiverse saga. All of the actors did a great job and I hope we'll see them again soon. I'd definitely recommend seeing the film if you're a fan of the MCU.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film is 95% gimmicks ,gadgets and overloaded CGI. What little plot does not appear until late in the process. Noted reception of crowd. The 8-14 crowd liked it but 15 and up just rolled eyes. Fortunately the popcorn was fresh."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"SPOILER WARNING: 

Kang Is definitely the new ""Big Bad"" of the MCU. Jonathan Majors killed it with his performance, and Paul Rudd was also amazing throughout the film. However, I do have quite a bit of criticism. For starters, Kang and Modok are wasted with this film, and it was really disappointing to see how both of them were Beaten. For Kang to be taken down be Ants, was underwhelming to say the least. Modok is brought in for 1 movie and then BOOM, just like that he's gone. The post credits scene was Terrible, almost unbearable. And the script was awful, it felt like the writers had no idea what they were doing while writing. They had good moments in the film, and it wasn't a bad film, but it also wasn't a good one. If your a casual film watcher, I would say to go and see this one. However, If you are a critic or a movie lover, I would sit this one out."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually a couple of the scenes are too overboard on CGI, but at the end of the day, the movie serves its purpose of being entertaining. Just about everyone in the theater really liked it, which is what matters. Something the Anton Ego-type movie critics cannot comprehend. Food for thought: Considering how many low grades the insecure, juvenile DC fanboys are giving this movie, they must have liked it and felt it was (another) successful Marvel movie as well."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Best Ant Man Movie. 
I'm glad I went to see it and ignored the critic score. What a sham.
Kang is the real deal but the critics are more evil than Kang! 
IMAX 3D it. Some amazing CGI and holes!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Disfrute mucho los personajes principales me parecieron muy bien principalmente me gustaron Scott y Cassie de la pel√≠cula lo mejor  fue Kang. La historia y todo sobre el reino cu√°ntico me gusto bastante y me pareci√≥ muy interesante. Algunos personajes secundarios me interesaron otros me dieron igual, me estaba gustando Modok pero el final que tuvo no me convenci√≥. Creo que fue la pelicula m√°s incre√≠ble de Ant Man. No iba con grandes expectativas solo para divertirme y disfrutar la pel√≠cula, las escenas postcreditos creo que fueron geniales."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"As usual, the critics are blinded by their arrogance and ignorance. An overly critical reviews and refusal to accept science fiction movies overwhelms their ability to appreciate a fun movie. Being neither Marvel fans nor science fiction buffs, they lack the ability to see a movie as being fun and impactful for the MCU fan. I will say that non-MCU fans and science fiction buffs will not understand the grasp of multiverse theory and other timelines.
I was enthralled and on the edge of my seat throughout the movie. I loved the interaction of the Pym/Lang family throughout the movie. The writers, directors, and actors added that family feel throughout the movie. IN this regard, I was cheering and biting my nails for the family and not the individual. My first reaction was wanting to see this movie in 3D. This was s definite cinematic spectacular. I was especially please to see all individuals get into the action. Although I believe that Jonathan Majors makes a great villain, I don't see him as the acting powerhouse portrayed by the critics.
I loved to see all the major stars in the action as well as many assorted aliens. This movie sets up a lot in the next couple of years for the MCU leading fans into Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The post credit scenes lined up the dynasty and the hint that one or more variants will be coming."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Some of the comedy was not needed and we needed more Kang!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A little slow out of the gate, but good mix of comedy and action. Good setup movie for the MCUs next big baddie, Kang the Conqueror."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie with interesting characters and a fun plot. It was a bit too complicated and a little predictable at times, so four out of five stars."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I am so frustrated by the negative reviews. This movie is so great. I love it!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good family entertainment
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just like everything else since Endgame. Plots are thin, writing is sub par, everything is cgi/vfx in volume. Over all its a filler episode for another Disney+ series. Also this isn't a Ant-man Wasp movie, it's a Janet & Kang movie. If you like Loki season 1, don't even bother watching, you actually don't have to as this movie is meaningless. Marvel and the Mcu are failing and this movie along with all the delays is showing just that. Look at phase four, this movie is no different. Save your money..."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super funny, plenty of tear jerkers every now and then, but, overall: PERFECTION PERFECTED!!!!!!!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than most people are giving it credit for. Worth a watch
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great start for phase 5. Gave an epic adventure to a character such as Ant-Man, in future movies people will look back and see the importance of this film, specially introducing such a powerful character as Kang the Conqueror."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Good story and special effects!!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"You need to watch the Loki series before you see  this movie! Great movie! Stay to see what happens at the mid credits, and end credits.... You won't be disappointed...."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Bro this movie was amazing, not sure why people are calling it bad but it was jaw dropping awesome and I definitely recommend any marvel fan to watch it immediately!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Ant-Man movie!! Had a wonderful time watching it!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme tipo sess√£o da tarde, entrega divers√£o e da o ponta p√© inicial da dinastia Kang."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Really cool flick. Has that enduring comedic theme that makes it fun for the kids and adults. Lots of action and adventure.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The action and the storyline was great!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is really good. It introduced the 5 phase of the MCU. Action and comedy were both there. And Kang was amazing in the movie. Solid movie that you should go watch.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The only entertaining thing of this movie is the performance of Jonathan Mayors as Kang. Rest of the movie was not that good, and the acting and CGI was off most of the time"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not as witty as first two plot is stretched a bit special effects are good entertaining and worth seeing in a theater
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Cannot understand why the reviews for this film are so bad. I disliked nearly all of phase 4 and thought the MCU was pretty much done for but this movie has renewed my interest in it. Really funny and just overall a really good time.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it. It was honestly everything I wanted it to be. I enjoyed the more serious tone even though it still has the stupid humor the franchise is known for. It was bizarre, beautiful to look at and Jonathon Majors was great. So much quiet rage. Very interested to see how this all progresses from here.

I had gone in with some vague sense that there were mixed feelings and bad reviews out there, but once I saw it for myself I was once again confused about what any of these reviewers are talking about. Some of these critics seem to be going in hating these movies before they even begin watching. Perhaps its fatigue with the amount of them in the last 15 years, but thats hardly the right angle to start from."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Lang family adventure into the Quantum Realm was weird but exciting and funny other than a few groaners. Kang was a terrific villain, and I want to see more of him in future releases.

Don't listen to the critics. This one is worth seeing."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing film. Don‚Äôt listen to the critics, they‚Äôre extremely out of touch with reality. Awesome film, great cast, great collection of marvel characters. Loved it, highly recommend. 2 post credits scenes!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"hope this kills the MCU at last, empy teather from where I watched, the good thing is that I saw more people watching the whale than this bad movie"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang rocks, definitely an intimidating foe to face."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie suffers a bit from a slow start as the players are moved into position, but once Jonathan Major's Kang is introduced in earnest the film takes off."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. Funny, colorful, great storyline and everything I wanted it to be. Critics are ridiculous.... what did they expect..."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critic review is dog and I believe motivated by anything but the truth. This is a fun adventure movie that kept me entertained and engaged the entire time. The main characters were great, I liked the locations and secondary characters as well. all-around a great 6.5-7 marvel movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"While not a perfect movie, this is a fun sci-fi action film that embraces the weirdness you sometimes find in Marvel comics. The story kept me interested throughout, the humor landed well, and the technical aspects were great. Overall, this is a solid entry to the MCU and avoided large pitfalls that other recent Marvel projects failed to."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie wasn't the best MCU movie ever but I thought it was fun. Kang is a great villain so far and this is a good bridge to move the oveall marvel story forward. Stick around for the after credits scenes.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining, don't listen to the critics. Jonathan Majors & Michelle Pfeiffer where especially great."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie has lots of humor along with good meaning and morals.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,it was incredible i loved this amazing movie that wasnt woke
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Wasn't quite as ""big"" or fun as I expected it to be, but also had some humor and plots points I didn't see coming. Maybe not the best ant-man movie, but it's probably not the worst either."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang stole the whole movie.  His official introduction to the MCU has me really excited about what is to come, especially with The Kang Dynasty coming in two years.
Ant-man and the wasp were alright, but this movie is really about Kang and what Marvel is setting up down the road"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a great 3rd installment in the Ant-Man story and did a good job of showing the complexity of the Quantum Realm, unlike the comics could do back in the day."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked this movie. The quantum realm is pretty imaginative, some of the scenes were pretty cool looking like the scene of multiple ant mans and wasps and jonathan majors is great playing kang the conqueror."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story that folds into the wider story very well. Just the right amount of funny and serious that you'd expect in a weird sci Fi comic movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the moment where the MCU find it way back to itself.
Not a stand alone movie but a perfect fit in the MCU canon.
Way more better than the previous movies with the forced propagandas.
A great father-daughter adventure in star wars way.
Representing real equality of many different creatures as it was originally showed in the X-men comics.
Teasing Kang only to be eager to see the council of him.
The only reason I can't give it a perfect 10 is the plot of M.O.D.O.K.
That was just cringe.
But the whole movie was awesome!
Must watch!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"LOVE this movie. Incredible multiverse adventure. 
Funny, action packed. Possibly my all  time favorite Marvel .movie
Ignore tomato. Somebody is paying them!!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Greatest movie ever!!!! Can‚Äôt Wait for more of the quantum realm
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super fun and Jonathan Majors is INCREDIBLE in it! A funny, weird world, every second was enjoyable."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"When I watch a superhero movie, all I expect is to have fun, of course. Well, I had the time of my life with this movie, super entertaining. Critics say Jonathan Majors can't save the movie? C'mon! Jonathan Majors IS the movie. He did a magnificent job!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I came here becsuse the critics score of ghos movie are ridiculous. I saw the movie last weekend with my daughter and wife. All three of us thought it was an 8/10, a thoroughly enjoyable Marvel movie. As a villain, Kang was a bit meh, but otherwise, good script, good acting, good fx."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Way better than the reviews will have you believe, I loved it definitely my favorite Ant-Man movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good Marvel movie! Amazing visuals and pretty good plot. Kang and Ant-Man are great!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just as the Guardians of the Galaxy took us to the far reaches of MCU's interplanetary space and Doctor Strange defends earth from the Dark Domain as the Master of the Mystic Arts, so does the Ant-Man family introduce us to the Quantum Realm. Projected backgrounds were used instead of green screens to give the actors more to react to. This film viewed in 3D has vivid and imaginative CGI, The cast is very familiar with the material and each other. After the Loki series unleashed the Multi-verse, we now see Kang the Conqueror as the true nemesis of Phase Five. Listen to critics who have never picked up a comic book and only rate high brow Oscar nominees that fail at the box office as worth seeing, and you will be manipulated by the studios, instead of enjoying action adventures on a grand scale that connect films and TV shows in a new style of interconnected storytelling."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was an extremely fun ride. Humor, but not too much, just the right amount of action. Suspense at all the right moments. And the actors all shine."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure why critics hate it tbh. It was a pretty good movie. Jonathan Majors was excellent, Sure the ant man family seemed a bit cheesy and could have been better done but this is a good movie and pretty good start to this phase. And sure for cgi please use whoever James Cameron uses lol but still wasn't awful. Simply put I was entertained and that's movies are supposed to do."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,To all the haters of this movieshove off. Im not sure what you were expecting. I loved. My young daughters loved it.  We are not comic book geeks.  We just love strong women kick ass. This film did a good job of that.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked it. I think  the MCU is embarking into a more action comic filming and it's OK, but not great. Thor Love and Thunder was a disaster. This was mich better. Paul is simply a simply al
 lovable guy. But the best was definitely Michelle Pfeiffer... my God, how does she stay so hot and beautiful after all this years?!?! Her performance is solid and gives the MCU and amazing strong character. More of her please :)"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly I loved watching this with my nephew he had a blast and it was intertaning I have read the critic reviews and it's kinda sad that they all seem to have lost there love for movies.   A movie dosent have ro be perfect it just has to give you a break from reality so if there are dragons or talking toilets just let that inner child laugh at the ridiculousness.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not an Ant Man film. Not as fun or funny as the previous entries. The film is one more Marvel setup movie to who knows what. It fit more under the previous face. It was almost 3 hours that lead to nothing. 
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was okay. But, I thought it was too much. It had too much action and not enough meaningful content."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,CGI of the movie was amazing as always. The storyline I feel was interesting to say the least
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie, we took are teenage grandson and we all enjoyed it."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It is that food, that you eat, but you're sure that you should have bought something else."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,It lacked the comedy the other Ant Man movies had. A bit boring.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! Majors did a phenomenal job playing Kang. They didn‚Äôt encumber us with the humor like in Love and Thunder. Go see it for yourself.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING 10/10
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,a movie made for the masses and people who have tastes equal to someone who puts vinegar on lasagna after dipping it in coke.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,terrible the cast? terrible the acting? terrible the cgi? terrible i hate it
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing graphics with the Quantum Realm. First half of movie was slightly difficult for someone like me who has not seen the other ant man movies. Plot was good, acting was good, overall really great marvel movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"i liked modok the movie is generally goofy, but actually the part that is more questionable in the movie is kang, when other characters reference him its very omniois and forced just wish they wouldve chosen to show him in action more than here say but great movie over all i embrace the weirdness!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"IDK WTF these ""critics"" are on. This was great. It has me stoked for Majors as Kang in Phase 5."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Not the best marvel movie but entertaining from beginning to end. I can't wait to see where they take this saga.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Definitely much more enjoyable than L&T, humor/seriousness well balanced, corny only a few minutes from the whole footage. Weird at points, but could we expect of quantumverse anything else? Oh I'm so sorry Scott is so caring for Cassie in this movie! When there's no development of his character in this chapter, then we have to take off points! Gotta fill those checkboxes from the list to receive a score! /s"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie action packed
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great and fun movie, it sets up the Kang journey to the Kang Dinasty and Secret Wars movies"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While Ant Man 3 features an outstanding performance by Jonathan Majors as Kang, the movie overall falls short of expectations. Unfortunately, the pacing is inconsistent, with certain scenes feeling long and tedious. Moreover, the world-building feels lackluster and unengaging, failing to captivate audiences with its strange and unappealing aesthetic. In comparison to the first two movies, the sense of fun is largely absent in this installment. The inventive and enjoyable fights that used everyday objects and creative size-changing mechanics have been replaced with a CGI-heavy quantum realm featuring forgettable characters and odd props that fail to leave a lasting impression."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was solid. A little longer than needed. But sets up what's yet to come
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Dialogue was a little cornyMODOK storyline was absolutely a misstep. However the leads especially kang are strong. It was a good origin story.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Takes a little departure from the regular antman movies but still adds the fun and from the previous iterations.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie. I liked the characters and stuff. Just great.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Honestly dont know what to say. Mid asf
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,l like the whole story line
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movies was great!! I loved it! Obviously the critics aren't fans of marvel movies.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of new stuff and hints to the future
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While not a perfect film, often dipping into the silly and under using certain characters and concepts, Quantumania is nonetheless epic, over-the-top Superhero Comic Book fun."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Very different from the first two movies but still all the same fun and humor to be expected from an Ant-Man movie. Kang is a wild villain and all of the Ant family gets to shine through. MODOK was freighting but funny.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of give and take. Scott Lang's character arc makes a pleasant completion circle. While Janet's is awkward and annoying. Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang was charismatic imo. And well Majors is a superb actor that gives his scenes a certain depth. The story was very telegraphed if you paid attention at all. But if you don't overthink things it was a pleasant story and an enjoyable movie. The background setting to me was on par with Avatar graphically. But a vast blue sky and sparkling waters always win over a dark cavernous world. I think I'm used to a Marvel movie's punches packing more oomph. And this one felt weak by comparison. Taken on its own I enjoyed it and that is all that matters.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"First of all, I'd like to say that I think the regular professional reviewers are just a tear against these type of movies but a lot of them, and they are looking at it in such a way that they have to compare it to other movies, which I think is crap. This was a very good sci-fi/action adventure, comic book movie, if you like Star Wars type movies, if you like other superhero movies, this is a really entertaining flick. These critics need to look at their stuff in a with a better perspective."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic villain, well written story, a good plot that didn't make ant man a joke like before. CGI was good and fight scenes felt fluent. Great cliff hanger ending. This movie is very good"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yes, plot holes. I'm surprised no one has mentioned the biggest, that at the end of Ant Man 2, Janet is standing by condoning tests of Scott to go into the quantum realm when she knows what she knows, but plot holes aside, this whole movie was brimming with great acting, good character development, a fun story, high stakes, and spot-on humor."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very beautiful movie, that had overwhelmed me through tears and happiness. One of the greatest movies of Marvel I would say...(Even if other reviews would hate the movie)"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a great movie it kept me entertained from beginning to end.  Jonathan Majors did a great job in the role of Kang the Conqueror.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fun, story, visuals and cast"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great entertainment for the entire family.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Ant-Man movie, personally rate it better than Thor 4 and most phase 4 projects. Definitely would watch again.

Jonathan Majors is badass as Kang and I can't wait for his return later in the MCU, Paul Rudd again smashed it out the park and is still one of my favourite MCU actors."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Es perfecta al fin una buena pel√≠cula de Marvel de est√° nuevas sagas.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a complex ride through the quantum realm marking a very good start for phase 5. Paul Rudd nails his performance, and Jonathon Major as Kang The Conqueror is absolutely amazing. The VFX, Cinematography, dialogues, and action scenes were all great. The end was a bit rushed, but it is fine for a 2-hr movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,so boring and disappointing
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Despite critics I loved this movie
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics will be critics maybe their MCU is just MCU fatigued, but I'm looking to see the bigger picture of each Marvel movie and TV show that gets released. I'd rather enjoy watching Ant-man in Quantummania and I felt highly entertained throughout the whole film and finally got a taste of Kang the conqueror which seeing this particular variant is capable of. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang's variants during the launch of phase 5. Remember been starting from scratch again from the start of phase 4 to build a multiverse saga storyline. Hopefully, phases 5 and 6 will end on an epic note topping the Phase 3 end game."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"De pronto la comunidad esta pidiendo un cambio a Disney, per la formula aun funciona."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Messy, undercooked and disappointing"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Emocionante y divertida. Un gran inicio de la fase 5.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything was wonderful and fantastic and dazzling.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed the movie action, comedy and an actually story!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally Marvel course corrects with a good movie. Great start to phase 5!!!!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It has a lot of good things, such as the performance of Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer, but that doesn't cut it for MODOK bad CGI, Kang's dumb actions as a villain or Janet's ""wanting to protect"" her family from Kang by not telling them the truth, only hurting them more.
6/10"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie.  A more serious episode that other Ant-Man movies (in a positive way).  Jonathan Majors was amazing as Kang. I'm watching every Marvel movie where he makes an appearance!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was fantastic. I would not change anything
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good watch, some misses, but fun overall."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I had such high hopes for this film and just like Love & Thunder I was let down. This movie was all spectacle and no substance.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Non-stop visual action but weak storyline.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Exactly what you'd come to love and expect from an MCU movie. Action, some drama, some comedy, great characters."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie. Jonathan Majors is incredible. Moved quickly with great action. My only meh was MODOK. Just a bit too corny.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this movie and the set.  You must see for yourself to be honest esp if you love Marvel Universe. 1sf timers dont understand
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Silly script. Kang the ‚Äúconqueror‚Äù was beaten by ants. Who is running(ruining) Marvel?!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I found it to be a fun ride! Sure the final act of all these MCU movies being almost virtually the same is starting to get old, but I enjoyed myself overall"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great, felt like a real ant-man movie and didn't try and do too much‚Ä¶"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this was a great addition to the Marvel universe and a good opening to the next phase of the franchise. I was getting a bit disheartened towards the end of the last phase, but Ant-Man has reinvigorated my interest and I'm now looking forward to the next chapter in this movie series.  Story was good if a bit basic, no forced jokes, good villains and good hero's."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie a lot. As the first chapter of a much bigger Marvel story it was good. I had no trouble with them sharing the story with the whole family. The true antman and wasp were given their spotlight. Kudos.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"In my opinion, best MCU movie since Spiderman: No Way Home. As a stand alone hero film it gave us the best part of Antman, goofy, determined and loving. Kang was amazing, Johnathan Majors is AMAZING! Perfect Kang. I thought MODOK was fine, hard to portray him but it was done cleverly! Overall, happy with this film, setting up for Kang Dynasty!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Worth going.   Never ending storyline.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not the best mcu movie/show but its the beginning of the the next big story. Kang absolutely was the star and I can't wait to see more. Antmans entire arc from doing heists to fighting the 2nd big bad all by himself and actually standing his ground. It was enjoyable, but it did have it's flaws. Prob top 5 mcu show/movie since endgame."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best MCU movie in a while. Good flow, liked the balance of comedic relief and seriousness, and the overall storyline was simple, which was nice since the concept is not as straight forward."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Wasn‚Äôt a fan of the whole storyline and quantum realm wasn‚Äôt as exciting. Was expecting much more since I enjoyed the first 2 Ant-Man movies
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. Great backstory with Michelle/Janet with Kang/Jonathan himself, a whole prequel necessary on how and why that variant was exiled. All the characters were good and Cassie/Kathryn fit perfectly as a social justice fighter in the Quantum Realm. All the characters were great and with the multiverse a hot topic with Kaku and Tegmark still slugging it out, this movie has a strong place and presence, especially with the much awaited end trailer/cookie, don't miss it. We've been waiting since Loki to see if He who Remains(the Conqueror) was telling the truth and now how that will pan out this summer in S2. I never liked Schr√∂dinger's cat paradox, since I like cats, and am more for Everett's many-worlds interpretation and theories of everything with multiverses, this movie does a pretty good job of showing why. I am glad to see movies showing potential ramifications of our theoretical physics and consider  these Avengers stories and series like The Flash as good STEM forward/advanced schooling for kids, from a former teacher. Keep up the great work!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Just enough funny and just enough seriousness.    Great setup for Kang.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Like every Ant-Man Movie this one was hilarious where it needed to be and filled with emotion and action as well. It also sets the stage for what's to come! can't wait!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Pym/Langs family dynamics. Jonathan Majors.

I would have liked if it was clearer that Scott did not actually win."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Bring your teenager, it‚Äôs a great girl dad movie!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring. Worst Marvel movie to date in my opinion.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"the storyline was decent, mostly believable. the acting was solid. the creativity was amazing. definitely better than Thor 4 and Black Panther 2. not perfect, but personally, I don't think it deserves the hate."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The perfect amount of action plus comedy that makes an Ant-Man movie amazing!!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,it's good for an Antman film. he's definitely more of a co star character than a main character though
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best AntMan yet!!!!!!!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun comic book movie that didn't take itself too seriously. Good plot, clear plot progression, good character development. This isn't cutting edge stuff, but it's not a tired trope either. All around good blend of action and comedy, as coming book movies should be."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,this was a really good movie. Jonathan majors great acting
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No plot, some entertaining bits but mostly empty and once again set up for the next Buch of movies. Wakanda Forever was much better."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too long, all CGI, no Luis, just introducing the next bad guy"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mediocre, Boilerplate, Dull, Lifeless, Mundane, Tedious, Uninteresting. Nothing happened. No consequences. No point to even watch it."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it from beginning to end. Ignore the negative reviews. They don't understand what is next for Phase 5 because they probably didn't watch Loki season 1. But this one is a good watch and nowhere near being the worst Marvel film to date as one critic said.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome! Kang got nerfed though.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is the absolute worst movie in the otherwise stunning Marvel universe. The only redeeming moment was a cameo from Bill Murray. The theatre should really pay patrons to watch this movie as we all lost hours of our lives in the quantum realm. It's hard to believe Marvel even released this movie; it's like nobody watched it before it reached the theatres.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm not sure who's saying that the movie is bad but they are wrong
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Great action and great story line.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really funny, very enjoyable and Jonathan Majors new villain is 100% watchable. We thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great start for phase 5. Audiences round here loved it and I personally give it 8 out of 10 stars.
Kang performance was impressive 
Funny quirks inserted that would make you smile
Rotten Tomatoes must need more critics because this is absolutely not a failure
If your a fan of Marvel you will love it too"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great start to phase 5. I enjoyed this one more than the second film and thought Jonathan Majors did a fantastic job as Kang. The shifts between his calm and assured demeanor to outright killer was one of the best performances of a MCU villain. M.O.D.O.K was great comedy relief playing against Scott. The father daughter moments were fun and touching. Not sure what movie the professional critics saw, but the one I saw got me excited for the things to come in this phase of the MCU."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was good for what it was.  A complete departure from the previous Ant-Man films. Most of my enjoyment came from the 2nd half of the film.  It's more of a Janet and Kang movie with a Scott Lang bookend. Again,  for what it is,  can't fault it for that. Biggest complaint,  The Volume. And lack of practical set pieces seaming the 2 together."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie! Great action sequences and a flawless performance by Jonathan Majors. He will be a great villain for years to come!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Personally I feel I didnt watch the same movie as some of the critics. It really doesnt feel like ‚Äúanother marvel movie‚Äù. Few quips, pretty engaging plot. It is lacking in some areas, but thats more of choreography and some missed jokes, not really writing or character stuff"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I LIKED THE ACTION, THE SURPRISING EVENTS, EVERYTHING IN ONE"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Blown away by Jonathan Majors. He instilled fear with subtlety, setting up a world of anxiety and high stakes for the next MCU phase.

The film is humorous, brilliantly feeds us parallel stories effectively, and gives three generations of heroes a chance to shine."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed this marvel movie and thought it outperformed recent marvel installments.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a good marvel movie. Not everything is going to be the best but trashing this is pitiful.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,A bit of cringe now and then but overall decent film
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A good way to get those who didn't watch Loki into the multiversal side of Marvel movies after the disconnect with MoM and NWH. MODOK is fun and Kang has potential but must be fleshed out a lot more, which I'm guessing will happen in Loki S2."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A messy plot and inconsistent tone prevents this movie from being a great introduction to Kang and the fifth phase of the MCU. There's some great stuff in this movie, like Jonathan Major's Kang, but it's also a movie that relies on jokes throughout. For example, anything MODOK does is horrible. Though Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has its problems, it's overall a fun movie that will be enjoyed by many. 7/10"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I could have done without the comments about how Hank Pym appreciated socialism, the random cry out of ""revolution"" followed by comments about burning it all down to the ground (stuff you only hear from wako leftists)."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not bad, a good family film I guess"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie needs a little more love. My only two complaints are that the moment between being sucked into the Quantum Realm and the introduction of Kang was a bit too long, which hurt the pacing. Second, Scott doesn't get a character arc, so it was emotionally empty, but I love how it ended and I see potential for the future of the character."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Worth it if youre invested in the overall MCU plans, otherwise better as a rental. The actor who plays the villain has the best performance."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Antman and the Wasp Quantumania was a great movie. It was fun and good introduction to Kang the Conqueror. Not quite as humorous as the other Antman movies but a good continuation in his story arc.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, funny action was great, good set up for phase 5. Not every single Marvel movie is gonna be a 10/10, the CGI did look terrible though. not amazing but I love Paul Rudd so whatever, I dont care. Its a kid movie. Its a superhero movie. I'm 34 years old what do I look like complaining about a movie meant for kids about a guy that fights interdimensional bad guys and is an Ant. Whatever dude the movie was fine. life goes on when are we getting a Xmen movie though?"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie overall. While it got a little too silly in a few instances for my taste, even those parts were enjoyable."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it!! Perfect follow up from the others. definitely worth it
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie introduces audiences to a thrilling new threat and sets the stage for what's to come in the next few Avengers films. It's a great story with good humor and a strong focus on family. The worlds are stunning and the characters are interesting. It's all around a fantastic movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Disliked the curse wirds
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was very good. I am so excited to see what else Marvel has in store for us. 

Jonathan Majors was excellent as Kang.

One thing I have to say though is they should have kept Cassie's actress from Endgame, still, Cassie's new actress is very good. 

MODOK was funny, but I wish he'd be a little more serious,"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,There was only one ir two parts in this movie that made me laugh. The movie felt very quick and rushed with Kant being defeated too easy and getting to that point too quick they could've done so much more buildup and story with what they had so 5/10 from me another mid marvel movie‚Ä¶
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A must see. Intense and very creative.
Great opening for Johnathon Majors."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great fun sci di adventure. Funny and exciting.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It's honestly the best marvel movie in face 5
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wonderful first introduction to kang and what he's really capable of. Wonderful solo movie with great stakes, had me wondering if he was going to get out the whole time!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,A great MCU movie but definitely not your typical Antman movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jonathon Major is ridiculous. And I hate that movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very enjoyable. It's not Avengers level but still really entertaining
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what film the critics were watching.  
I've been a comic book fan for more than 30 years and was one of the closest a film has ever felt to actual comic."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"i really enjoyed this film, visuals and comedy were great. very different from the first two ant man films. the comedy was still same though, just a different feel. this is the first MCU film in a while that has got me excited for the future slate of films"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I actually quite enjoyed this film. I thought the characters were enjoyable (M.O.D.O.K. was an ok character, not the best, but caused a few chuckles), and the plot was well thought out. I think that Kang is definitely going to be a great villain in later movies, and I can't wait to see what happens next."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the critic review is very inaccurate, while yes the story being ok (nothing to really praise) it's fun, enjoyable and entertaining film. And in the case of the MCU I think it has a good balance of story and set up for future films which was needed as Kang was a pivotal character in the film. Over all, fun film with a decent story good visuals and entertaining action"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"loved Jonathan Majors, the story was good, loved the special effects ,would have liked Scott's character to be a bit more heroic"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was drawn into this movie from the first scene. It wove backstory, family, and the weirdness of the Quantum realm together very well. A little weak on the ending but some introspection on Scott's part stuck the landing."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Did they use Pym particles to make a 2 hour film feel like 4? 
That was utter sludge."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun movie and had everything a comic movie should have
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,good start to phase 5.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely awesome! Don‚Äôt listen to critics!!!üêúüêúüêúüêú
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It's not the best from Marvel but it's part of the story that's building. Go watch it with low expectations and won't be disappointed
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,La pel√≠cula desperdicia algunos personajes que podr√≠an ser memorables para el futuro pero cumple con ser entretenida y con ser un eslab√≥n en la nueva fase de UCM
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the critic's this move is nothing but fun. I have not been to the movie theater in years and I'm glad that my first movie back was awesome.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. Some predictable stuff but a very good all around flick
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A little too long some parts could have been cut out, good action"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie is quite good. Happy to see the old Marvel type of stuff.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining movie with a great villain. Can't wait for the next steps of the MCU
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great continuation of the MCU,~!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun experience I might consider watching in IMAX 3d.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and it sets up phase 5
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't pay attention to the haters. This is another fun Marvel movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and a good story line. Not too difficult to follow the story. The cast was great. Who doesnt love Paul Rudd?
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The opening of this film is fantastic. I found myself laughing seconds after the MARVEL title rolled. Paul Rudd's performance as Scott Lang never feels like an act, as he naturally fits the role. His character is charming as ever in his 5th movie as Ant-Man.

Marvel is known for extensive world-building and interconnected stories. Since 2021's ""Loki"", it has been known that Kang the Conqueror is the next Thanos-level villain in the MCU. This film gives us a deeper look at Kang, and the casting for his character (Jonathan Majors) is excellent.

By leaving the regular world and diving into the world beneath (the Quantum Realm), the film relies heavily on green screens and computer-generated imagery (CGI). These graphics and effects are some of the poorest of the franchise, with a character called MODOK being the worst. There were times that the film was reminiscent of 2005's ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"".

Other than the CGI, the biggest weakness in this film is the screenplay. From rushed plot points to painful dialogue, it is evident that the screenwriter had never written something of this magnitude. In the emotional and climactic moments, the script is so bad that it distracts from the story, with the audience in my theater audibly laughing.

""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a small piece in the larger Marvel storyline. This is felt throughout the film, as the convoluted Quantum Realm and endless timelines are explored. The first two Ant-Man movies succeeded in simplicity, but this sequel was anything but simple. In short, the character of Scott Lang is better as the friendly, neighborhood Ant-Man.

Best Character: Kang
Best Scene: Scott's Book Reading
Best Quote: ""I don't have to win. We both just have to lose!"" - Scott
Best Piece of Score: ""Theme from 'Quantumania'"" - Gives serious Avengers Campus vibes."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,A great movie to begin the next phase of the MCU :)
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it .  The critics got it wrong.  Breezy story that cut to the chase.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie with good story line. Kang is amazing, he stall the show."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another M-She-U a bunch of Mary Sues and AntMan playing 4th on his own film,"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent action as expected, seen the best in acting making the character's come out as sensational."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was a good movie. Not extraordinary one. I would expect new powers on AntMan, or new struggles, something new. Nothing. Kang was amazing. Some comedy elements used in last movies were not here like the funny recap of the Mexican friend. There were great visuals specially that one in many antman. See it. Enjoy it. But don‚Äôt go with amazing expectations."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, nice.. a bit distracted in the middle but the end saves the day! Could have been better but still good enough to enjoy in the theatres :)"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Buena pel√≠cula le falto espacio para desarrollar los personajes del reino cu√°ntico pero presento un excelente villano
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Thanks for defecating all over the MCU for all of phase 4 and apparently phase 5 as well disney. I loved all the movies from Iron man through end game. Captain marvel was a little shaky, but it was.... OK, only just. Quantum mania has taken what in my eyes was an underdog franchise which turned out to be fun and funny mixed with tension and payoffs, and turned it into a punching bag. Marvel has crushed itself under the weight of its own hubris, and the deviation from cannon is just cringe now. I hate this movie, and I wish the mcu would just stop."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good Ant-Man movie. I wasn't disappointed because I was not expecting ""Infinity War""..lol"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a solid MCU addition overall. While parts felt like a generic sci-fi flick, the ending was a nice pivot for the Kang Dynasty"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,it a good move i recommend it
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"¬°Hola! Acabo de ver ""Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania"" y tengo que decir que me encant√≥. Esta pel√≠cula es un preludio introductorio que te deja con ganas de saber m√°s sobre lo que est√° por venir en el Universo Cinematogr√°fico de Marvel.

Una de las cosas que m√°s me gust√≥ de esta pel√≠cula fue la forma en que presentaron al personaje de Kang. Jonathan Majors hace un trabajo incre√≠ble al interpretar al villano, y su presencia en la pel√≠cula definitivamente deja un impacto duradero. Adem√°s, la qu√≠mica entre los personajes de Antman y la Avispa sigue siendo tan fuerte como siempre, lo que hace que sea f√°cil invertir en sus historias y querer saber m√°s sobre lo que viene."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,kang is soo good . I hope he return more powerfull in avengers
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was fun to watch and way better than folks on YouTube say.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is a great start for phase 5! Not sure why people hate it. Lighten up and have a sense of humor. Marvel is for all ages go watch DC movies if you want less comedy. I HAVE HOLES!!!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The dialogue was a little bland, but I still enjoyed it."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Writing was subpar, acting was weak. Had a lot of left-leaning undertones baked in as well. Hoping that Marvel will seriously consider their direction."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its fun, fabulous and Kang is scary and addictive to watch. Want more of Majors baddy."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"First half of movie plodded along and the acting was stiff, over the top (especially Pfeiffer)  and slow.  Lack of any further character development with core characters.  This was entertaining but ranks in my bottom 3rd for Marvel movies."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. Great Energy, Wacky and Wonderful. Really great one for the Marvel Fans who have felt the last few releases have been lacking something"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it was a great show
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great start to Phase 5. Overhated for its story and characters, but Kang is easily the best part of the film. The idea that Kang can possibly be everywhere is intriguing, and creates excitement for the rest of the phase. Nothing really terrible about it, overall solid film."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a great movie that has action, good special effects, funny and opens a new phase"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the movie! Excited for Kang involvement in future movies!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Contrary to reviews, Quantumania succeeds due to quality performances by Rudd and Lilly, a strong villain role by Majors and enough action to entertain. If you watched Loki you'll appreciate this movie more, and thankfully this movie restores phase 5 to a possibility after the dreck of Thor and WF"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great flick! Missed the wombats but had a much more ""serious"" tone."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, loved ant man"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, that maybe was a little long in parts.  Missed the whole crew though...no recap from Michael Pe√±a is a huge loss...keeps movie from 5 stars..."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I wasn't expecting a great movie after seeing the critic scores, but honestly it was a great movie.  Good mix of humor and action, and really starts up the next story arc of the newest big bad.  I'm glad I ignored the critic scores, I'm a huge Marvel fan and have been really disappointed with the last few shows and movie, definitely worth seeing on the big screen!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"My teenage kids claimed to like this movie, but this old man thought it was violently very bad.  The plot made no sense.  The acting was not so good.  The special effects were remarkably Un special.  If you are adult, forget it."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It wasn't bad it had good laughs and gave some background to what Janet was doing for all those years It had some fun background characters and Bill Murray. Not a bad movie at all definitely worth seeing at least once.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,There is something off with the energy and flow of this movie. MODOC was completely stupid! It's a Hard No for me.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Felt like a Star Wars movie set in the MCU.
Jonathan Majors is perfect as Kang. The rest of the cast is also amazing. However, comedy in this movie didn't work for me and I didn't like the direction they went with MODOK. Still a solid movie that deserves to be watched on the big screen. Definitely better than most of Phase 4."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it. Best marvel movie in a long time. Great villain, and great way to start off phase 5 of the mcu."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a great introduction to the next phase. Everyone did a great job and delivering on the screen regardless of the amount of cgi they had to work with. I'm super excited and will def be seeing it in theaters to see the next installment. I don't see movies anymore I'm theaters but if it's marvel, I'm there."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Kang is tied with Dr. Doom as my favorite Marvel characters. And I love Jonathan as Kang! He's such a great actor. I can't wait to see what else he does with the character.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel is back in form with Antman 3. Never a dull moment, comedic moments that didnt feel forced, and a great cast."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"First of all the movie is great! It doesn't deserve the hate it gets. Mostly i loved Kang and Scott Lang in this movie. The acting and performens of them is just great! The effects and visulls are great and the post credit scenes are also just amazing! I wanna see more about Kang in the future MCU projects because he was great! 
The only thing that could be better in this movie, is the storyline and how the script is written.
But overall the movie was a great start in phase 5 of the MCU whats a good sign for the future of the MCU i think. So i will give the Movie ""Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania"" great 4 out of 5 Stars üî•"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,A great set-up movie for Phase 5. Good to see much more use of Michelle Pfeifer and to see such a talented ensemble cast.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was fun and entertaining. There was a slow spot or two, but once you got through them it was enjoyable. Kang was great, but the CGI for M.O.D.O.K. left somethings to be desired."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie!   We love all the Marvel movies!  And the CGI was amazing!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action and entertaining.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible, not worth the watch"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was enjoyable and fun to watch genuine happiness and the veiws were beautiful.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like the plot, the CGI, the actors, and the overall movie. Definitely better than Thor: Love and Thunder."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing, definitely in the top half of phase 4, don't listen to people saying its not good, great story emotion cool visuals and an amazing plot for kang"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So this felt like Kang movie, not Ant-Man 3. You got a hybrid movie rather than one strong Kang movie or one strong Ant-Man movie!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was fun to watch wasn't the best marvel movie, but if I had to describe it in one word, it would be ""fun"". Paul Rudd was amazing as always, but Jonathan Majors as kang the conquer stole the movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,goofy ahh movie. couldn't take it seriously
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Acts 1 and 2 couldn't decide on a proper pacing. Michelle Pfeiffer lacked enthusiasm throughout. Act 2 needed more of Kang. The CGI in the first two acts was inconsistent but nothing horrible. The 3rd act saved the movie. Overall its better than the previous sequel but disappointing and slightly worse than the first Ant-Man
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a great movie, and a great setup for the upcoming movies."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Of the Marvel films, this is my favorite 'first watch' Marvel film since Infinity War. The world building with Kang, the Star Warsy Quantum realm, and the CGI that was better than I thought given early reviews, all impressed me."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it - critics are way to hard on Marvel movies, all I read was this movie does nothing to push the Marvel timeline forward - who cares! It made me laugh and it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon with my kids and wife! MODOK stole scenes and Kang lived up to hype....post credit scenes were exciting as well - two of them if you go see it."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I will never be able to get over Modok and how horrible the cgi looked. It was almost like they ran out of money right when they were ready to design his look. Cassie is also an issue.. the writing for her makes her unlikable and a bit annoying. Kang is really the only redeeming thing about this movie. Part of me thinks they should have killed Scott Lang off to build up the stakes in what is becoming a lackluster fifth phase.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie is great. CGI and Visuals are second to none. All star cast gives an outstanding performance. Critics are fatigued and love to hate.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was one of the best of this phase. It felt so new and kept me interested the entire time.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I really enjoyed this movie. I thought like the other two Ant man movies it had that spark of humor but not that might take away from the action involved,
I'm usually annoyed lately with all of the CGI effects but for some reason it really worked in this film. A good escape at this time and I would recommend a trip to the theater to catch it"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a complete Ant-Man fanatic, I loved how the Ant Man franchise didn't take itself too seriously - different than all the Marvel movies (with a nod towards Guardians of the Galaxy).   Quantumania makes it serious....and fast paced....with new worlds and beings and plot lines you need to quickly take in and understand.   The jokes that Scott makes throughout the movie are absolutely great, however you don't have time to enjoy them as the movie hits the gas with you having to take in a LOT of information quickly.  A second viewing definitely helps.   Is it worth watching?   Yes.  Could you leave the theater a bit dazed?  Yes."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,very disappointed tbh
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have no idea what the critics are smoking these days, but this was awesome. A fun, wacky adventure for a side character that's going to have some messy implications for the future. Excellent character development and Majors as Kang is the best casting the MCU has done since RDJ. This is the first MCU movie to get me excited for the future of the franchise in a long time."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie I think it has a balance of  funny and action.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I found the pacing and timing of this movie a good point in it's favor. You are never lost or disinterested in the narrative. I found the overall presentation enjoyable, with some (obvious) inserts that are easily passed over. 

Kang is an excellent villain whose overall designs are kept close to the chest. This variant (of many) is a linchpin for the grenade that is coming.  MODOK is... a surprise and the one disappointment overall, though getting back an aspect from the first Ant Man film was nice. 

Overall a good view, worth theater viewing, but not top tier."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,I know Antman is underrated and since last few movies they are not going as per the expectation but the movie was literally good to watch they can make this more adventurous because we are going to set-up KANG now being a marvel fan I am happy with  the overall experience not every movie can be endgame but the way Kang character played by  Jonathan Majors is commendable.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie in itself wasn't bad. Like most marvel movies it was quite entertaining. Again though it seemed like a bridge piece movie. I understand they are trying to jump from infinity war and Thanos to this new big bad guy but again I felt like this movie would've been better off as a series of 6 episodes instead of trying to cram it all into 2.5 hours. There was a lot going on and a lot that felt missed because of that. The hard part for marvel is this reset. People are expecting infiniti war level movies when they forget all that came before that is what made those 2 movies so great. We are in that phase again of the build up. Stop pressuring the powers at be to force everything into these movies and let the growth happen naturally as the story should be. Anyway rant over. Go watch it. You know you're going to anyway
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had it all. Action, comedy, great set up for the next stage in the mcu."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Not the best Marvel movie yet but it continues ghe Antnan Storyline.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its a great family movie that turns out is about Heros and SCi Fi, recommended, I have enjoyed. 
The only thing that I didnt like it was M.O.D.O.K but even that was not enough to ruin the movie, you will not regreat to watch this movie.

The best definitely was the introduction of Kang performed by Jonathan Majors."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"fun movie but not that great,very rushed tbh but jonathan majors as kang is amazing"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie to start MCU phase 5
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure what the issue with the movie was.  I believe the movie was awesome.  Khan was great throughout the movie and played an epic villain.  The end scene, however, did not do his efforts with his character justice."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible rollercoaster. One of the best Marvel films, deep emotional connections, new relationships, fantastic story, love how this really lifted up the multiverse fun."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The graphics, the motion chairs with 4DX and great story line too.."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, not as good as the other 2 ant man films, must have watched previous films  ant man 1, captain America civil war ant man 2 avengers and game and first season of Loki , moon knight etc. in order to not get lost along the way"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors was amazing. Wanted a bit more of serious Ant-Man but I know that‚Äôs not canon. Also thank you for the MODOK bit. I am a sucker for that kind of stuff. 
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this movie succeeded in being entertaining while moving forward in introducing new overarching villains.  not everything is a home run, but this is a solidly fun film."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Very funny and great action scenes. Jonathan Majors as Kang is fantastic. Don't listen to the haters.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is hilarious and Paul Rudd's performance is beyond amazing
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good movie, and it builds nicely off of Loki. However, if you have not seen Loki, this movie will lose meaning as you won't understand who Kang is and his backstory. Furthermore, the film has high stakes as Scott only tries to protect his daughter. It is a bit clich√© at times, especially with MODOK. But it is paced well enough to where it wasn't slow. Critics are just hating the movie because it isn't real or whatever. (There are aliens and giant ants in this movie, how real could it be)"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved it!! It was perfect and had a little bit of everything. The perfect intro to the multiverse saga. We get a broader understanding of how things are gonna go down in phase 5. One of my favorites, loved it,  chefs kiss!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a good start to the next phase of MCU.  The movie had enough action and humor to make a good standalone Antman and Wasp (and family) adventure.  Ignore the out of touch critic and just enjoy the show.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,it was amazing...kang stole the show highly recommend u guys to watch it
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I‚Äôm a massive fanboy for all things Marvel. I would rate this movie on par with Strange MOM. It was definitely better than Thor L&T, Eternals & Black Widow. A nice setup for phase 5 craziness to come!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the adventure.  I liked the story.  Just sorry they didn‚Äôt really give Wasp anything to do again.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It is good to watch i overall enjoyed it some loopholes are there but it is enjoyable VILLAN of movie is best!! acting of all actors are perfect
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another outstanding movie in the MCU. So creative, funny, and EXPANSIVE."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted this to be a good start to Phase 5, but it failed miserably because of a  bad script and some poor CGI (poor MODOK). The acting was good, nothing to say about that."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen it twice and it doesn't disappoint the viewer, the overall story line of the movie is great. Cassie is a really good supporting character in this movie and this movie overall sets up the next phase of Marvel."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie spectacular cinematography
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was amazing, from beginning to end and there was not a point where I felt bored, everyone was doing an amazing performance, J.Majors absolutely killed it as Kang and I absolutely can't wait to see him next, also both mid/post credit scenes do an amazing job at keeping the hype for what's to come."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is the best antman movie, period. Must watch!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, not sure why it's getting bad reviews."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman and the Wasp Quantumania was a amazing journey, that 2 hours was super good. Obviously Jonathan Majors Nailed as Kang the Conqueror. Paul Rudd once again did a good job with antman and the rest of the cast for their roles. I loved how they portrayed the quantum realms as we never seen it before. The humor of this movie was solid and the only reason it's not a five is because I felt the defeat was a bit simple and Antman in the end didn't lose anything I wish it was more impact full and had a major sacrifice that would have a big impact on Scott. Anyways additionally MODOK was also great, I totally recommend watching this if you are diehard marvel fan like me or even casually enjoy marvel, This movie Kickstart the phase 5 better than I thought. And the post credit scenes were also worth it."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent story that ties up several loose ends.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining movie.  cracked me up a few times.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you're rating this 5 stars, you're telling me it's one of the best movies you've ever seen in your life. In which case you've not seen many movies, you've definitely not watched all the Marvel movies or you're just unhappy that critics are more objective than you're prepared to be.

Putting aside the whole history of non-Marvel cinema, a 5 star Marvel movie for me would be Endgame, Thor: Ragnarok or Spider-man: No Way Home. Quantumania falls far short of all three. A four star movie would be Infinity War, Guardians of the Galaxy or Black Panther. Quantumania doesn't live up to any of those either.

Does that mean there's no fun to be had? Absolutely not. It's an enjoyable movie overall and a visual feast. The cast are clearly enjoying themselves and in Kang, we have one of the MCUs more interesting villains...and yet it all feels very paint by numbers. Arguably, Ant-man has yet to have a solo movie that truly makes the character shine, and that's a shame, because Paul Rudd continues to be excellent in the role."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good, fun movie. Few potential plot contradictions but overall a good marvel movie"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie reminds me of how civil war setted up infinity war so this one will set up kang dynasty.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie. Jonathon Majors is a great Kang - can't wait to see more of him as the character. Writing was spotty at times but the comic relief helped out - wasn't nearly as forced as ‚ÄòThor: Love & Thunder' which I found cringe at times. The visuals in the quantum realm were very cool even if it is just CGI. Lastly, the post credits scenes hyped me up for what's to come. Best Ant-Man movie yet."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed!!! It opens up the thoughts of a different world. Good always wins against evil.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I understand where the movie went with this but there was less of the normal banter and less ANT-man in this movie than there should be. This was more on Cassie and Janet show albeit Janet had a role in the realm.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think the movie doesn't deserve the bad grades it got, yes it wasn't a very good movie, but it wasn't bad, it was a little more advanced version of the classic ant man story, the visual effects were good, but there were some shortcomings"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A villain that promises so much, defeated so easily."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. When watching I was captivated with the world. Acting is A+ as usual and Jonathan Majors is perfect as knag. I would be lying if I said it was a perfect movie. The pacing is all over the place. Some of the CGI felt out of place. Overall great start to Phase 5 and if you are looking for a good story to watch this movie is for you.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Film che non mantiene una certa logica nelle scelte compiute e nello svolgimento della trama. Pessima introduzione del villain. L'unica nota positiva √® che si muove in ambienti familiari che rendono tutto sommato la pellicola piacevole
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie was nothing less from what I have expected...that being said-M.D.O.K's whole arc felt unnecessary and could've let it down to sink from where it came from..loved the chemistry between Scott and Cassie..but Jonathan Mayors nailed as Kang and proved why he was chosen in the first place..he got huge range for acting..in short-Phase 5 got a bold start and the future looks promising unless Kang has stole it already lol !!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was good but they didn't show the time controlling power of Kang and did not showed him powerful he killed so many avengers in the multiverse but lost to ""Ant-man"" but yeah I liked the VFX"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fun and entertaining, but nothing spectacular about it."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The culmination of what so many marvel shows and movies have been building towards recently and setting up for any exciting future in the MCU, can't wait to see where it all leads!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is enjoyable but would have benefited from expanded plot points, better dialogue, and actually including the wasp."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel doesnt disappoint! Paul Rudd will keep you laughing from beginning to end, really good movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,didn't enjoy it at all.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was under the impression that the MCU had gone darker, bolder, and more in to a risk taking path. The risk was in fact taken and they completely missed on this one. With one of the worst scripts, line deliveries, over saturated jokes; there's not a whole lot to go on in this film. Kang is the only thing that kept me watching. He was a compelling, well-thought-out villain. Poor execution on how and when to introduce him. I left the theatre with no hope, no fear, no happiness, no laughter, and no optimism. I simply left."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie theater was very warm. The movie was okay, but it was hard to enjoy because the theater was too warm."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is it perfect? No. It's basically a long set up for a longer plot, and it shows. However, it is a huge step up from laughtrack filled Thor, and zombie-esque Dr. Strange. It feels like a phase 2 movie, and has enough serious moments to make me enjoy it thoroughly."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was definitely an Antman movie, this fits the MCU character very well. It feels like it has been ripped out of the comics and I love how Kang was portrayed in this film, as a man who has been lost you can really see and feel how desperate he is to get out throughout the film. Scott's motivation for being his daughter speaks volumes and it speaks significant volumes. Ones that made us the audience care for her well-being as well.  There were some parts that I thought could have been a little better. I like how they did M.O.D.O.K., but I wish he had a different ending because there is still more that could be done with his character. If you watch all of the MCU shows and movies and are a devoted fan then you will love this movie and have a much higher appreciation for it as well."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"God Awful movie. 

I didn't think the MCU could have a worst movie than 'THOR: Love and Thunder' or 'Iron Man 3', but this is the worst of the worst, even by 'Antman' movies standards. 

And Modok...hilariously BAD!  The MCU isn't even trying anymore."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just a horrible movie, I'm a big Marvel fan but this one was super disappointing. The dialogues are so so ridiculous, and there is literally 0 value to this movie especially following Loki. 
I'm really sad that this movie is another proof that marvel lost its way and they that have no vision or strategy. Unfortunately it's another failure following, Hawkeye, She-Hulk... And more"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel Phase 5 started stable. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a madness of oddities but I like it. Kang is frightening, Jonathan Majors manages to save a good part of the film for his hilarious performance. Full CGI film, however, very well used. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer have an incredible performance. I loved the last 2 post-greditos scenes"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don‚Äôt fall asleep during movies. I was even drinking an energy drink during the movie and it was still so uninteresting that I fell asleep.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Its almost good for me. Not bad at all.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie.. I really enjoy it.
Specially mit created and post created sence."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok. Nothing great about it. Good intro to Kang but what the hell was that with M.O.D.O.K. Looked like bad 80's cartoon.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely entertaining. Don't understand the haters. A must watch if you're interested in keeping up with the timeline. Villain character was incredible.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed the movie, but I kind of felt like I was watching Star Wars. It was funny and fast moving."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it . Although there are some places it  may have improved.. but in the end it's not something like infinity war , it's an antman movie and it followed the tone like the previous ones and offer's complete enjoyment .This isn't the first time critics and audience have different views towards something like that to understand it we can take the examples of  she Hulk and Ms Marvel both had good critics scores but couldn't live up to the expectations of audience that's why we should not let some critics opinions influence our views . The best way to know is it good or not you must go and see share your opinions not others."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is a lot of fun. No super forced jokes. Action scenes were fantastic. Idk what was going on with these critics, but I know my wife will love this considering we are both fans of the first and second Ant-Man."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel did it again.  Fun, entertaining, and worth the wait to see Ant Man again."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, I both enjoyed and liked it more than stuff like NWH and Endgame, it's very funny, natural and the pacing is great."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie in phase 5
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a great movie with classic marvel action. I felt the dialogue was a little too quirky, also kinda felt like a place holder and a set up for future movies but it was supposed to be KANG THE CONQUEROR felt more like kang the average villain"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,I wish it could live up to the hype it created but it provides a descent entry for another variant of Kang and a good start for MCU phase 5.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is an ant man movie and it lives upto the expectations you just can't expect a avengers level movie because you have kang, it's just the beginning of kang Dynasty and Phase 5, Jonathan steals the show."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the better Marvel Movies! It finally connects dots teased about the Multiverse, it's answered questions, brought up new ones. It's relatively fast paced and it brings the action on pretty early in the movie! 
It has everything you want to see in a Marvel movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I felt that this movie had one thing going for it; Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror. However, as the movie dragged on, it felt like it wasn't taking the all-mighty Kang as seriously as it should have. There were many cheesy moments, poor acting, poor visual effects, and very poor music placement and choices. Many instances of things that were un-explained and/or very convient for the plot. 

Many times I felt dissapointed by the poor consistency of the movie. Something that obliterated one individual did nothing to the other (not because the other was more powerful, it was simply because it was convient for the plot). Descriptions such as ""beyond space and time"" had no real meaning or weight. 

Going back to what I said, they reduced Kang from this powerful character to a someone who barely showed any power throughout the movie. He lacked power, and so did his goons (who were organized by him, so it's odd how they were so pathetic).

 I also felt like they had this fantastic world to explore and develop chaacters from, but all the vital characters in the story were human, and uninteresting. Another wave of nobodies unnessacarily added to the MCU."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wasn't as good as the previous two episodes. Didn't start off where the last one ended where Scott disappeared or explain what happened. Parts of the movie seemed really dumb.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Was funny but the storyline was a little bland.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me gust√≥ mucho la pel√≠cula, es una buena apertura de la fase 5"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Felt like it was supposed to be a StarWars movie with all of the weird alien characters and spaceship technology. The final fight dragged and followed the pattern of ""it's doomed"" to ""unexpected hero saving the day"" like 7 times before it finally ended."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The ‚Äúnewness‚Äù of an amazing Marvel universe that is tied in to an epic future.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining Movie!!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Best Star Wars, avatar, tron movie yet lol."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie rocks. Think of it like Ragnarok, with a bit of Palpatine. If you didnt like Phase 4, this is for you."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie. Enjoyed it a lot.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The cgi was awful‚Ä¶.I would enjoy it more if Marvel would get back to writing good scripts and not how fast they push into theaters. Again, Quantity over Quality‚Ä¶.do better marvel ."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this was the best ant man movie so far. Jonathan majors as kang was amazing in this roll. Sammy Sheldon costume design got kang looks exactly like the comics. I think the only thing I didn‚Äôt like was that it just leads to the quantum realm within the first 20 minute of the movie . Other than that this movie has great visual affects and full of action pack with some comedy but not to much that it over takes the action of the movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a good movie better than others antmans movies
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie does it‚Äôs job. I was entertained. Not the greatest marvel movie, but still enjoyable."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Storyline terrible, script terrible, save your money."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,its a normal superhero movie which give fun
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie with great characters, nice jokes, amazing vilan and fight sequences. The critics have to learn that a movie can be good  with different elements. Just because you never seen something like that before doesn't mean it is bad."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I can‚Äôt understand what there wasn‚Äôt to like. I can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs next after this.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Can see why it might not have been some peoples cup of tea, but for what it sets up it did the job. Jonathan Majors the new MVP of marvel"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,8/10 movie.  And it opens the 5th phase of MCU. I enjoyed it.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Without giving too much away, there was a plot line of retribution for an old adversary that was totally lame and kept me from giving this a 4th star."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I never seen such a gap of reviews between the Critics and us the Audience. overall I enjoyed the movie, and the real introduction to Kang the Conqueror.  J-Maj got some work cut out for him these next 3-5 years; he's got the MCU on his Shoulders."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Genuinely decent film, pacing was okay but Kang stands high as a new good-bad guy"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I remember when reading a few years ago that Ant Man 3 was going to all take place I  the Quantum Realm I seriously had my doubts on how they were going to keep that Ant Man humor and also make the movie work. But, I was very pleased how the movie was put together and explained everything very well. This movie was a A+ Marvel movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"lousy movie, poor script, generic villain"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed it with three grandkids, very entertaining for all ages."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was solid.  Amazing villain, which makes or breaks a comic book movie!  Truly felt like we were taken into another world with the biggest threat in the MCU yet.  As always, the Audience Score is more accurate than the woke Critic's.  Yes, Lilly was against the Clot Shot Mandates...  GET OVER IT!  Recommend seeing this movie!  Much better than Eternals, Thor 2, Thor Love & Thunder, Captain Marvel, Antman 1 and 2, Black Panther 2 (and maybe even 1), Ironman 2, Black Widow, Shang-Chi, Incredible Hulk, and anything DC!!!!!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The first thing to note: what an absolute slander by the critics. This movie does not deserve its poor rating. My opinions? First of all, a great introduction to phase 5. Easily the best movie we've seen from marvel since Shang-Chi and NWH. People say Jonathan Majors takes the scene from Paul Rudd, something I can't entirely agree with. Although Majors' portrayal of Kang is an over-average casting, Rudd continues to combine the kind of idiotic-ironic comedy perfectly with his heroic seriousness. The movie does, however, have its downsides. Personally, I think the start moves way too fast. Another thirty minutes of character-building and just an overall exploration of the Quantum realm would have been good. Although M.O.D.O.K was great, I find it weird to have him killed off, being such a big character in the Marvel comics. Still, overall a great experience, a fantastic introduction to phase five & Kang, and worth every penny!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It is not that good but it is not that bad too .Every can't be 'Endgame' .I loved the end credit and post credit scene which is very important and I kindly liked it.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The plot is weak, the characters are poorly built and developed, and once again the title characters are secondary and men are replaced by strong female characters. Kang is menacing at the beginning and his Kinect powers are conveniently removed towards the end when he is defeated by ants... the legend that beat up Thor and many avengers lost a battle against giant ants! Kevin Feige, can you please explain how is it possible? A villain builds an empire in a quantum realm, defeats the enemies, and banishes them to other areas but somehow, all the power, the wisdom of different timelines, and an armored suit are destroyed by an army of ants. Sadly, Kang forgot to build the true army, because those blue-head soldiers led by MODOK won&#39;t beat a battle against ants and two second-level heroes. Where are his generals and captains? Does Marvel truly think you can build an empire like that without a chain of command? Is Kang the only intelligent being in that realm to succeed in that task?

Basing phase 5 in this movie will be problematic as it won&#39;t be entertaining enough. Where is the arc of the heroes&#39; build-up, I did not feel attached to any of them, the Wasp was present in two key points and is secondary or does not engage in the plot. Since her name is on the title, why is she disregarded at this level? It is unknown to me.

Scot Lang is laughable and sadly present to pass the torch to his daughter in a future event for sure... Another gender swap set up. And Marvel, Feige, and woke army continue their journey to boring storytelling.

SFX are miserable, I understand the quantum realm would require amounts of SFX, but it is laughable to see MODOK like that giant turd. I foresee VEB becoming a nice toy for kids...

And once again we see Marvel descending quality over quantity, sacrificing characters and my time. It is probably my last attempt at the Marvel franchise at the movies."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a must-see movie, especially if you want to learn more about the upcoming villain, Kang.

The plot is fascinating and well-done, with a nice balance of humor, character development, and action sequences. However, the absence of Luis is deemed unfortunate, as he is responsible for adding humor to the film.

Overall, the movie is a great addition to the Marvel movie series and a good continuation of the Ant-man series."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie best movie in mcu this is so good movie
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics must have something against this movie,  although it's not a great movie but not as bad as some of those critics review claim to be.  Overall pretty good popcorn movie, entertain enough that my wife didn't fall asleep.
Actors put out some great performance, script/writing of the movie is the biggest shortfall.
Watch it in IMAX or Dolby theater definitely will make this film much more enjoyable."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"We really enjoyed this movie! Don't regret going to see it opening night one bit. I know the critics have different opinions but it seems the mass majority of the public thought this movie was great, including ourselves. Loved Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas etc. Johnathan Majors is an AMAZING actor, I definitely look forward too seeing anything he is apart of after this movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"movie was good , kang was very good and
they could make better. my ratting 6.8 out of 10"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a movie classic  Ant-man movie  good comedy, and good humor enjoyed it really much"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's such a phenomenal movie. loved how it continues to expand on the bigger picture. I don't understand all the dislikes on this movie. it expands on the quantum realm, on antmans family. it has heart, comedy, and action. people who complain about it starts of slow and so on, don't understand how to make a movie. I loved all of it."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had fun with it. Not top tier Marvel, but my favorite of the three Ant Man movies. The writing isn't always the best, but again, it's as good or better than the other Ant-Man movies. And I liked that it at least payed off on the promise of quantum realm craziness and wasn't like Dr. Strange 2 that promised a multiverse of madness and gave us like 3 different universes that were just kinda different and a bit odd."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I have never seen the previous Ant Man films, but have watched every MCU movie that he has been featured in, so I don't have any comparisons to the other two Ant-Man movies. I had very low expectations for the movie based on the low score by critics and some buzz that it just wasn't that good. Instead I was pleasantly surprised by the film. The movie offers a lot of good actors that actually fit their roles very well in the movie. I still have trouble seeing Paul Rudd as a super hero but he does a good enough job in this one. Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror really steals the show, and the reason I was eager to see this movie is that we finally get to see a Kang origin story. 

My only issue is the film doesn't seem to give us anything afterwards. It feels like it left off where we started. Kang is still somewhere unkown, the multiverse is very confusing, the timelines are also confusing, and I can't imagine what kids are thinking watching this, because if I'm confused then they must be too. It's weird to watch a two hour movie and have a decent story be uprooted by the post credit scenes. The first one is very confusing and the second one sets up Loki season two, and there's a million Kangs. The actual movie is good, and I was entertained. It had more special effects than I expected and they were done well. The Quantum realm was actually good."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,A Great Start to the Next series of MCU Movies!!!!!!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I DONT GET WHAT THE CRITICS ARE SAYING BUT THIS FILM IS REALLY GOOD!! RALLY ENJOYABLE. THERES NOT EVEN A BORING MOMENT. PLUS THE 2 END CREDIT SCENES MADE MY MOUTH DROPPED. GOOD LUCK FOR THE FUTURE AVENGERS
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"For those who are fans of the first two installments, you can just pretend this was never made.  The movie plays like a fully Disnified Marvel cookie cutter movie.  Not that different from Thor Love and Thunder, which was also a complete joke.  It is a shame.  The Antman franchise was really the only enjoyable Marvel line-up.  With that said, if you have kids under 15, then they'll likely have a good time.  This isn't made for adults or film lovers.  Disney is just toxic.  Pushing this woke socialism culture on the audience.  Just let ""Art"" be ""Art"".  Or at least do it in the context of a decent movie.  All this money and garbage is what it produces.  At this rate, 20 or 30 years from now, there will be no more real films, just the same formulated plot and content for every movie.  Scary."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Que filme diab√≥lico de ruim, como fazem uma coisa dessa, como algu√©m tem a capacidade de fazer algo t√£o profano assim."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was funny and the evolution from the second movie to this one shows how each of the main characters have grown. The introduction of Kang set up how the MCU will be impacted for the next 4 years.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"üêúAnt-man Awesome üëèMovie Hai New Phase ki first movie hai. 
1time watch movie hai but film ke start me vfx cgi ka kaam theek nahi laga but story perfect hai"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cluttered with a little too much comic book logic, but packed with fun characters doing fun things in a fun movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've never really relied on the opinions of critics when it comes to movies, and this particular movie is a perfect example of why.

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a fun and entertaining journey into an imaginative new world punctuated equally by moments of humor and heart. It's full of spectacle and action but still allows us to feel connected to our heroes since they are as normal and down to earth as we are. There are no God's or Sorcerers or Mutants leading this film, just normal, everyday people forced into the most extra-ordinary of circumstances.

The movie is pretty self contained which is an amazing feat for a Marvel Cinematic experience but there are plenty of Easter Eggs for the die hard fans to discover as well. 

Even though my son and I literally laughed out loud a few times, the movie does a great job of balancing these lighter moments with the more darker elements of the story.

The actors all put in a great effort but special consideration needs to be given to Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang as well as Kathryn Newton who plays Cassie Lang. Michelle Pfeifer's role was expanded this time around as she serves as something of a tour guide to this incredibly strange world.

My only complaint would probably be that the movie could have used another 15 minutes or so to better flesh out the secondary characters so that we might feel for them a bit more when it came to their plight. As it stands we definitely root for them to win but it would have been nice to have seen some of the trials and hardships that they mentioned they suffered at the hands of the main villain.

All in all, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was a fun and satisfying chapter in the Ant-Man franchise that delivered on all counts. Part Star Wars and part Wizard of Oz, Quantumania is a return to the fantasy adventures of days long gone. My guess for those ""critics"" that did not enjoy it, is that long ago, they forgot what it meant to experience a sense of wonder and joy that a journey to a strange new world can truly deliver."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Even though it is not the best Marvel or ant man movie. It does a good job of setting mcu phase 5 and 6. And the movie has one of the best post credit scenes of all time. The movie acts as a stone for setting up the character Kang
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,The protagonists in the movie are too nonchalant about the seriousness of the situation. Never got a sense of any danger from the villain.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie followed typical Marvel script but performances elevated the mediocre story. Certainly looked like introduction to wider new phase of storytelling but lacked any meaningful character growth from the protagonists. Good humour and action and fund overall movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is SOOOO GOOD!!!  This is what Marvel movies should be!!!  No moral lectures.  No ""woke"" agenda.  Nothing but a super fun, imaginative storyline that opens up countless possibilities for future movies.  Both my wife and I absolutely loved it and we'll go see it again in the theater - this time we'll take our kids!  A seriously great movie!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"After Avenger:Endgame , its only the Marvel movie i enjoyed a lot !!!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the Kang most... Baaad Asss moments
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a great movie! It was setting up for what's to come so I am here for this!! You have to really understand the marvel series and has to have watched all the side shows that Disney put on Disney Plus to really enjoy this movie!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just pass the time movie. ant man character doesn't feel important, Kang is the real star of the film."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Went in blind , wasn't sure initially of where the movie was going‚Ä¶ found myself really enjoying it 90 minutes in. Thought Kang was a great villain and there was some good acting. 73/100"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ant man quantamania was good enough to start phase 5 and not all Marvel movies are like infinity war so yaa it's a slow story movie till 1st half cause it has to establish tha character of KANG THE CONQUERER So yeh movie was good enough you can invest your money by watching in theatres but don't waste your money on Popcorn and that kind of stuffü§£
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't let the critics rob you of seeing this film.  Jonathan Majors is Kang.  The visuals were well done and the ending keeps things were it should...wide open
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I understand both sides of the argument here. But the critic score being so low is crazy. The final few minutes aren't on par with the rest of the movie and make it feel out of place. But in general this is a solid fun touching and action packed edition to the marvel universe. Great fun
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't see any reason why critics can give this a lower score than Thor or wakanda it was a much better movie than both
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was great. There was not a lot of exposition, it let you know what you needed to know and got right to it. However I think this Marvel movie might have actually had more dialogue than most. The visuals were awesome, really took you to the Quantum Realm and was believable once you suspend belief. We learned new things about the character's in this third outing, and there's even more to know. It was good for a few chuckles that were genuine. This was a great Marvel movie and stands head and shoulders higher than Thor: Love and Thunder. Which felt forced, including the ""humorous"" aspects. Quantumania is a strong movie that sets us on our course for this phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's an MCU movie for MCU fans. While I can understand some of the gripes of the critics, the movie was a lot of fun and Kang was awesome. It was my kind of humor and I enjoyed it."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The Star Wars of Marvel. Funny where it needed to be. Serious everywhere else. Kang was awesome. Not the best of the Marvel movies but a great start to the next chapters.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is funny, wild, and beautiful. Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors are amazing. It's not a must see for the MCU but for the fans it is a must for phase 5 leading into Avengers : Kang Dynasty."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, this was the MCU film that two weeks pre-release I was most excited for in a long time. Kang, direction, answers and more were all teased. The trailers did nothing to reduce my anticipation. 
Then, the critics came out and announced their first reactions which were mixed but mostly positive. Then, their reviews came out and I was incredibly nervous. Watching the RT % drop each day was worrying. Then the audiences seemed to come and out and speak. At the time of writing it's at 84% and I was relieved. 
This is easily the best Ant-Man in terms of scale. If you're a fan of the small, contained palette cleansing Ant-Man films then you probably won't enjoy it as much. 
The cast are phenomenal with shout outs to Majors, Pfeiffer and Newton. 
The major grumbles that I have towards this film is the thing that stops it being one of the all-time MCU films: 
1. The comedy. It intrudes too much and sets a weird balance of tone. We could have had a really dark storyline. The humour in places is great but often misplaced. 
2. Quantity. This is already the 8th film in less than 2 years not to mention the quantity of Disney+ shows. This is being rectified by Feige and co. 

Overall, if you want an enjoyable two hours that goes by insanely quick, this is for you. Trust the audience and not the critics. 

Also - stay for the mid and post credit scenes. 

In Feige and Kang we trust!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was terrible!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantumania continues the adventures of Scott Lang and his family as they get pulled into the mysterious Quantum Realm. New foes and old faces return for the third installment of the Ant-Man story
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is easily on of the best Marvel Movies for a long long while. Not Just MCU movies, but Marvel as a whole. I haven't enjoyed a movie like that since No Way Home. It's a CGI Fanatic Masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of Modern day CGI. 

The story was indulging and compelling and captured the feel of Phases 2-3 once again whilst simultaneously making it fit in to the Multiverse Saga. The Jokes are at a minimum, but when they do appear they're slotted in very well and nicely. Scott Lang was a bundle of joy as usual and Cassie was an incredible great new addition! Janet was rather annoying and is pretty much insufferably for a good portion of the movie. One of those characters that won't let anyone know anything until the very end no matter how many times she was asked. HOWEVER, Kang. Wow wow wow, Kang the Conqueror was an absolute god-send of a character. In just 1-Episode and 1-Movie I would already say that he's a more feared villain than Thanos ever was. He was phenomenal in this movie and  Peyton Reed with Jonathon Majors did a VERY good job at portraying him. Easily one of the best things about Quantumania. You have to be patient for him, which is actually a good thing in this movie, but when you see him, he's everything and more!
M.O.D.O.K was too a great character villain too! Funny, spiteful and gritty! Thoroughly enjoyed his appearances!

Overall, Antman 3 has been an incredible ride that sets up the future of the MCU better than anything else in recent times. It's story feels like that of Phase 2-3, it fits in with the Multiverse Saga, the CGI was INCREDIBLE and the Characters were almost perfect! I really enjoyed this and I hope that the MCU follows this recipe going forward!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Really fun movie and sets up Phase 5 perfectly
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Be wary of those who say this movie is great or the greatest  Marvel movie of all time. It's not, Thor: Dark World is better. I went with two friends, one of whom is a huge Marvel fan. He said ""Marvel is dead."" Watching this movie I felt I have seen this movie before and it hit me, this is almost the same storyline and plot of Rise of Skywalker. The jokes aren't funny, in a packed theater the only thing that got a laugh was a person snoring in the middle of the film. There are scenes that could've been longer to add to the overall plot, but they were lacking. The effects get boring fast because in a lot of other films have used them before."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun and entertaining!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Homem formiga quantomania est√° longe de ser um filme perfeito, mas tamb√©m est√° completamente distante de ser um filme ruim como a ""cr√≠tica especializada"" tem dito.
Tem uma dose de com√©dia na medida e nada exagerada como Thor amor e trov√£o, e cria um ambiente familiar da fam√≠lia formiga bem interessante de acompanhar.
No mais, o destaque √© obviamente KANG!!! Jonathan majors da um show de atua√ß√£o interpretando as variantes do Kang e isso √© uma adi√ß√£o perfeita ao MCU."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I think the best ant an movie is ant man and the wasp quantumania also the post credit and mid credit scene oh mu God mind blowimg
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was more of a beginning of Phase 5 and intro to Kang movie than it was an ending Antwan trilogy‚Ä¶AND I LOVED IT!!! It had the fun and heat that you expect from Paul Rudd and gave you a clear understanding of why Jonathan Majors was cast to be the big bad for this era or the MCU!!! Jonathan Majors is a FORCE!!!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film was how a Marvel film usually is, and nothing more. Great VFX, lots of action, and some good acting and some bad acting. The writing was very mediocre and some parts of the plot felt semi-slow, but there was also some good laughs in the movie. Johnathan Majors truly shined in this film, though, and I‚Äôm excited to see what Marvel has in store for him in the movies to come. Michelle Pheifer was excellent as well."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,MODOK was the only bad thing in this movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"When booking the seats, nearly all were taken up, but when the light went down to start showing the film there must have been at least 20 people in a cinema that can hold 100 :-/

Overall not bad movie"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not a great movie but an enjoyable one, thanks to Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd. Great post credit scenes."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie ! Kept me entertained the whole time. Very wholesome. Loved to see the vandyme's and Lang's be there for each other. I would love to see it again.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Slept through the movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,This is the best ant man movie but it is having so many sub plots and the main plot starts in the second half but as an beginning of new dynasty it is awesome the build up for kang vs good there are no comedy punches when kang is there. Modok was disappointing but still it was a good movie and must watch for marvel fans because of kang.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is fun and enjoyable, the cgi is well done, i think they just need to utilize very carefully the important comic book characters like MODOK i feel he is wasted here. But overall i like it"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,i liked the movie it was above average atleast
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exciting and funny, good cast."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall,  I thought is was an okay movie.  Some corny parts but this is a comic book movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was funny and felt fresh with some brilliant scene and some that were a little too kitch. Overall great enjoyment. I just don't understand the hate by the critics.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,It just wasn‚Äôt very good. I laughed at all the wrong times.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Gran pel√≠cula de superheroes hecha para disfrutar
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was overall good with decent story also the 3D experience and visuals are eyefeast. A very good part of the movie are visuals itself. The mid and end credits are very important for this film. Must watch for all the Avengers fans
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great addition to the Marvel dynasty. cinematography was amazing and story line was unpredictable. Loved it!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't buy the critics review. The movie exceeded my expectations. I didn't go into it expecting a life changing experience, but I did enjoy it more than a lot of the more recent marvel movies and shows. I wish we could have had more time with the side characters. Maybe that could be a series. Very good acting."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best MCU movie
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good, but not great. A nice intro to Kang in movies."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"According to old Marvel , IT'S not that type but it still gives a good vibe you should watch specially kabhi the main villain it's dope üî•üî•"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a great Ant-Man movie, and did a great job setting up phase 5! Excellent movie. I didn't go in expecting Casablanca. It's a great Marvel movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel phase 5 started outstandingly
love it!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I didnt care for the story line .
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Has a bit of a Star Wars feel but not much they could have done different with the story. I actually thought it was better than the last Ant-Man. The Rotten Tomatoes score shows critics are getting tired of Marvel movies but they don‚Äôt speak for the general movie watchers.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Despite not being too memorable I quite enjoyed the previous Ant-Man films, but Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a terrible mess that forgets what made the pervious films fun & if you thought Phase 4 was forgettable, the start of Phase 5 is worse.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania only saving point is Jonathan Majors, who is trapped in series of poorly shot action, hand holding storytelling & some of the worse MCU humour. If you make a joke, don't repeat it & don't treat a characters death as a joke either."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A fun sand funny romp! Good pop corn movie, worth seeing"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, great scenes, good plot, nothing shocking or 'game changing' but overall a good ride and a good fun movie overall, plus you don't have to watch the other 20 MCU movies nor the other Ant-Man movies"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A bit piecemeal at the beginning... wanders aimlessly. But it warms up nicely. Definitely walked the line between solid Marvel and silly Marvel. But overall, a good movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Critics may dislike it because 17 titles in Phase 4 went nowhere and inevitable backlash occurred. This is tonally disconnected, like Thor 4, but worse than Thor 2 or Thor 4? Not even close. It is certainly not as disappointing as Eternals. The bloom is off the rose, though, so movies will get probably underweighted in retaliation for Black Widow somehow getting 79%."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie had very good action, plot, humor and a good villain. Ant Man's kid wasn't annoying and is a good addition to the team while also still learning the ropes of being a hero. Though some humor seemed forced or out of no where, Paul Rudd still makes the movies pretty damn funny and still an action filled hero movie. Kang was a very powerful villain with a good set up to the ""Dynasty of Kang"" thay is coming. Overall I would Gove this movie a B+. 8/10"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I go to movies to be entertained and watch something enjoyable. Its escapism.  Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania is not the best of the three Ant-man movies, but its worth going to see: 1) on the big screen 2) keeping up with the current Marvel MCU storyline and 3) for Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang the Conqueror.  Its not as funny as the previous two, and some of the humor falls flat. But its an important cog in the current phase of the MCU.  Follow the advice of the moviegoers and ignore the critics. If you enjoy Marvel movies, you'll walk away feeling satisfied with this one."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really good the story was good I loved everything about it and ant man is not even my favorite character
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a super fun watch! Liked it a lot better than Wakanda Forever and it is leaps and bounds more entertaining than Dr Strange 2.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I just came back from the cinema, I was on 3D 4DX and I will say that it's a bit weak with this 3D main character, but the background looked like I was watching without glasses, it's about the plot, it drew me in. I'd be happy to go again, but for 2D, because these 3D are a failure. SPOILER!!! || in my opinion, the wasp was treated a bit poorly because as the name of the movie says ANT-MAN and the wasp: Quantomania BUT the Wasp is hardly there || I rate the movie 3.5/5"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I really thought the movie was fun! I recommend for other people to watch but before you do watch Loki and previous Ant Man and Ant Man and the Wasp. I feel like I should watch it again to catch any Easter eggs I missed.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this movie was great, everyone saying it is the worst Marvel movie is lying or haven't seen the Incredible Hulk. It definitely is the worst but also isn't the best 4/5"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Don‚Äôt listen to the critics. This moving was great and was a good opening for phase 5. The acting was on point and it had good action and plot. It was very enjoyable and I am exciting to see more to come. 
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great action entertainment movie and the vfx was great. Half star for the modok waste but kang was awesome.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Arguably the best actor out right now, Majors does not disappoint. Overall the movie was a blissful sit back and enjoy type feel and if it's indicative at all for what's to come in the future with the MCU then I am 100% on board."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a Marvel movie, but I love Marvel. Same formula as the rest obviously with cheesy jokes, but it's Ant-Man and that's what makes it good. Based on trailers I was expecting a more serious Ant-Man flick, but those serious moments were washed over with comedic relief because Disney. However, Jonathan Majors' performance was great and can't wait to see more Kang. Stay for the two end credit scenes!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Really great movie.  The comedy was excellent action was off the charts. Visually Stunning!!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Film sets up Phase 5 of MCU and it's really gives vibes of Kang and sets up the Multiverse Saga. This film was always expected to give us some questions and the answers will be given in future.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Idk why critics not liking this movie, yes  its a average marvel not like endgame or infinity war but not bad as justice league"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! Great action and comedy
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The visuals of quantum realm are really spectacular. The villain of this movie, kang is really amazing to see. And this sets up a pretty good start for the phase 5, specially with the two credit scenes I think mcu is now gonna go crazy with their stories."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I know this movie is not perfect.
But as an antman movies this is the best antman movie. And this movie properly introduced us that the journey begins..... Kang Dynasty"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don't understand the critics negative take on the movie. Clearly there is some bias now for Marvel movies. I'm now distrustful of critics reviews. I think many are getting paid to pan certain films. Is it the most cohesive film? No. Is it as bad as Thor: Love & Thunder? No. I thinks it's better than Doctor Strange 2. It's not a top tier Marvel movie but it is good. My wife who does not like these genre of movies even said she enjoyed it. Had some very funny moments. Jonathan Majors helps carry the movie. Wait the the two end credit scenes! It's worth the wait! My major complaint is the cursing. This is probably the Marvel movie with much more cursing. It's was not needed, especially the penis jokes. I think many of these writer are not as talented since they have to use profanity. I can't see why that is attractive in this type of movie. If you take your kids and they aren't normally exposed to such language, you may need to have a conversation with them about the cursing in the movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie, not a great one but worth seeing in the theater. It was in line with what I expect from Ant Man and had some good background to some things that had happened. I rate it a 7 or 7.5 but it was missing Michael Pena's character. I would have given it an 8.5 for that, even if he only appeared in one of the post credit bits.

Some of the online reviews complaining about it are very weak and I am glad I did not listen to them."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great marvel movie, and a great way to start out phase five. It has a few flaws, but the overall it was an awesome movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie... Majors stole the show. Not as clean as previous Marvel edits but I guess it's tough because every environment was greenscreen. That said, they really sold the world (the quantum realm), it looked fantastic."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another CGI charged thin plot Disney-Marvel production. Some of the worst plot travesties may be Janet being the prime evil by ""omission"" (and they even visited the QR before for healing particles). Also MODOK is wasted as a joke with an even absurd ""redemption arc"", where Cassie, a girl who didn't know how to punch, suddenly bested the Killing machine! also replicated his father's giant man form (Stated in Civil War as a worked solution) just by sticking some shooting discs on her wrist. Soo many inconsistencies that you need to ""drink  the juice"" twice just to watch it"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Where was Louis? The MCU has jumped the shark. Movies are no longer fun.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie my kids loved it everyone has their own opinions just go see for yourself
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was good.  I liked the introduction of Kang.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie's maker can make more good but it don't disappoint me
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was easily the best MCU movie, since endgame! "
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was excellent. Not to serious, far from mediocre and hilarious. It's nice to yet again see superheroes not have to punch their way out of every problem. The continuity( which the movie is really about) is being ramped up to 11. I've been patient Mr. Feige. Phase 4 was a bore. I'm waiting for that action now. My marvel itch was more than satisfied."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall as a superhero marvel film it hits the mark with some entertaining fight scenes and interesting concepts. A bit ott with the CGI but that's hard to help given the set up. 

The main win in this film for me is the villain. Kang is executed perfectly which for me is refreshing as I haven't really enjoyed any villain in the recent MCU films. As always they're a few scenes in the film that just feel unnecessary and pointless but I just roll my eyes and move on."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun time at the theater! Kang is a menacing villain. can't wait to see more of him, and there will be a lot more of him soon. The 2 post credits scenes set up for future movies/tv shows. Go see it!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,The story seemed rushed. Not much detailed dialog.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,greatest Marvel movie so far of the year Kang is truly the Conqueror üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüòé
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyable movie
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"O filme √© nota 7/10 na minha opini√£o, n√£o chega a ser um filma√ßo, mas n√£o √© um filme ruim."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This wasn't an Ant-Man movie - it was a generic MCU movie to introduce Kang.  While the character of Kang is interesting, and exploring the Quantum Realm was neat, it just didn't have what I loved about the first 2 Ant-Man movies.  Most of the characters and the relationships didn't have the emotional connection the other movies had, and the forced humor without beloved Luis and Co. were cringy.  
It's a decent MCU movie, but I want my Ant-Man and Wasp movie back."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie is good entertainment and keeps audience engaged.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very Good plot... Comics accurate... Felt movie was OVERDONE with so many ""STAR WARS"" like creatures ... (Because didn't got this feel while watching GOTG) ... Too much in love with KANG characterization... Will definitely watch again and again..."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really liked the movie. I did think we needed more story with regards to Kang, and less Bill Murray."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a good movie... overall a mix of entertainment and action. The movie is all about Antman and his family members entering the quantum realm. It misses its story plot frequently and the 1st half is weak but the 2nd half is amazing.. overall good. The post credit scenes are amazing and setups the future of Kang dynasty.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Um filme dentro da franquia do Homem Formiga foi o melhor dos tr√™s!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Exactly what it should‚Äôve been. Solid marvel flick.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good. Acting was superb. 3D was awesome!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie had great CGI, acting, and was even funny sometimes."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel really has fallen and they can't get up. Another legacy character wasted. Another poorly written disappointment. Now, a villain that turns out to be a chump. Kang the Chump, not conqueror."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Tried to do too much, poor plot and story, poor characters and just not that funny."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,No Luis Recap no 5 Stars !! Other than that I loved it! I liked the narration at the beginning and end. Don't listen to the critics go see it!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really awesome and poignant worth watching highly recommended
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great little flick. 
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A mi me gusto, es el inicio de un personaje que poco a poco va a ir generando problemas para los cuales ser√° necesario reunir un equipo grande para atacarlo (los Vengadores) en este momento apenas se esta presentando"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had excellent computer graphics, however, some of the scenes were a little over the top.  Such as Michelle character was a little hard to swallow.  Very unbelievable."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kang is very good, but the story is disappointing....didn't like the star wars vibes"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jesus christ this was awful.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was really good, even if it was CGI heavy.  Jonathan Majors is excellent.  The plot was fine despite a couple of very large plot holies."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,All I can say this movie is a bang! I don't care what the critics says but this movie was really2 good and I can say that I could go for another watch.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie did a great job at doing what it was made for. Introducing the next big threat in the MCU.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Aburrida, se ve de mala calidad, personajes nefastos y la muerte del villano de las peores!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Movie! Such a great visualization of the Quantum Realm and the Graphic Artists did so well with the imagery. Full of laughs, a few tears, and elevated heart beats! I'd see it again!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome job like the comics.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kept me interested the entire time.  Had moments where it was strange...but I suppose it made sense given the context.  Definitely worth a trip to the theater.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"All the humor and action you'd expect from an Ant-Man title, plus Majors is chilling as an exiled Kang.  The quantum realm is visually psychotropic, and the pacing is just perfect."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Simple plot, good introduction to a villain and further character development to current cast. Could do with more backstory on new side characters. Some good and some cheap laughs. I enjoyed it"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was expecting Kang to be a little more of a tyrant. That‚Äôs ok tho, the story line build up is working."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even though its not a perfect movie, the most complaints I ve seen is about stuffs the critics missed themselves. Most critics dont know the quantum realm has thoroughly been explored in past movies, Kang has been given a background in LOKI and the interconnectedness between events with other mcu movies are there."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Film was awesome! Had a good amount of fun,  humour and action. Story is setting up nicely for future marvel films with Kang; think he's an excellent villain and those end credits were crazy!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,biggest steaming pile of dogshit ive ever watched
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Its mid its not as bad as thor love and thunder(2 star) but it is not as good as wakanda forever(3 1/2 star)
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics be damned. This isn't meant to be a serious film. It's meant to be a fun ride into a new world where they set up the future of marvel. And they did. Hit the right tone of humor for the character and made the story compelling, even when feeling a bit rushed. Only complaint is that it feels a little overly influenced by Star Wars."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It‚Äôs good, not anything too special but Paul Rudd delivers with good comic relief as well"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie started Phase 5 with a bang!  It really brought together some of what Phase 4 and the multiverse were introducing.  Kang is scary bad ass.  The MCU is back in business and back to the same feel as the first 3 phases.  Paul Rudd is fantastic.  The scenery is amazing and props to the CGI animators and designers.  

As for every critic complaining about too much CGI, that's like complaining about too much animation in a cartoon movie.  It's a fictional universe that can only be represented by CGI."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Set up the future files in an exciting way! Very Star Wars-y vibes which is a cool deviation from the usual MCU film. They didn‚Äôt rely on Paul Rudd‚Äôs comedic genius to carry the movie, because they didn‚Äôt have to. It was exciting and fun to watch with letting other character have the punchlines. People have complained MCU has been too funny and this was definitely funny but appropriately funny. Special effect work is better than they have been. In my top 15 MCU movies."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved everything about this movie, it was funny, great action, and really good special effects. I think the plot was great and it was a super hero movie derived from a comic book which I feel like a lot of people forget when they complain about these marvel movies. This was awesome and I have no complaints!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,For me it was a good movie and I enjoyed it.  The  negative for me was MOODOK and some of the jokes were corny .
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,MCU (with Quantamania) continues to show a lack of vision and poor writing for their movies since Endgame.  I am on the verge of switching to the DCEU.  The trust is about gone.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"buena pel√≠cula, entretenida, las 2 horas se pasan bastante r√°pido y no se siente lenta. Kang es el MVP aunque un poco infravalorado. Creo que es una buena introducci√≥n a la fase 5 y espero con ansias ver a otras variantes de Kang desatar el caos en el MCU!!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,really fun movie. light hearted and great visually
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,We really enjoyed it.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, don't understand the hate. Better than Multiverse of Madness and Love and Thunder."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I believe the ""pile on culture"" has impacted the reviews of this fun flick. Is it perfect?  Nah.  Is it gonna win the Best Picture Oscar. Nope. Is it full of the fun and humor mixed with adventure and action we expect from the Ant-Man storylines?  Yes. 

If you enjoy Rudd, like the less serious Marvels and just want to be entertained, go see this film."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Good fun. Enjoyed the story and I'm interested to see where the story with Kang goes.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie split the fans in half it seems... I loved this movie. The cgi was great, modok was great, and the story was alright. Only a few problems, one of the biggest being it should have just been called ant man and cassie, because hope was barely in her own movie, and when she was it wasnt anything big. From a critic stand point I understand why they dont love this movie, but from a marvel fan I love that I can follow each of these movies BECAUSE ive watched everything thats come before this"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,This was a fun movie...as good as any of the other Ant Man series.  I saw this with my daughter and we both had a great time.  I don't understand the negative reviews?
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I see a lot of people saying it wasn't good and maybe my bar for entertainment is low which I don't think it is. Jonathan Majors is fantastic in the movie and that alone makes it worth watching. It was entertaining from beginning to end. It was cheesy at times but yeah it's Ant-Man the character is cheesy.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved it 
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,If you follow and love the MCU this is a must watch! It sets the stage for Kang Dynasty & Loki season 2.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, exciting, wild!  And Kang?  [Chef's Kiss]  And a Loki Teaser!  Squeee!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not the best marvel movie but was pretty fun to watch Kang's ending could have been better. Rest was fun.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Should've saved the money
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was entertaining, It was fun and in general it was everything I was expecting and more. No complaints."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although it was very unlike the other Antman movies, I was still entertained. It was fun escapism with mostly good performances."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was good and the special effects were good also.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it to be honest, kept with the same theme as the other two antman movies. Funny and a lot of comedic scenes, some serious ones too I loved how they showed that side to Scott Lang, nobody should mess with his daughter!! Loved it, really did love it, can't wait til Kang Dynasty now it's going to be so good"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved how Jonathan Majors played Kang! He definitely can play all the variants in the MCU. This 3rd instalment of Ant-Man and Wasp was an amazing story for anyone who is a fan of marvel movies and comics alike. The fanfare brings this Rick and Morty world to life and I definitely would see this again!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Needed those brutal fight scenes off the cutting room floor
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-Man is a great setup film for phase 5 of the MCU. The acting jobs done by Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathon Majors are great. The cinematography of the quantum realm is something that should be seen on the big screen. The only negative is the dialogue which is a little simplistic. I still recommend it. It is definitely better than Eternals and Thor: Love and Thunder. 
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is great, to see it with our family."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not going to sugar coat it. Not the best movie I have ever seen but certainly more enjoyoable than most. I have seen most MCU movies but skipped a LOT of the Disney Plus series, save Loki. I was not bored the entire movie and was entertained. What more do we need? I think the critics are full of crap actually. They have sticks up their butts."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was great, I don't care what critics say. It was a good movie. It's a great way to introduce Kang & preparing us for the Big Multiverse war coming up. If you like antman movies you'll enjoy it. If you're tired of superhero movies, then move on. Don't be like the critics."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A good film, though if you don't follow the MCU closely you'll miss the fact this film is actually all about introducing us to Kang."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite some limitations in special effects this movie is visually appealing and the design of world building, costumes, and characters is very creative. Jonathan Majors puts in a great performance as Kang, and this movie serves as an exciting introduction to what will likely be one of the main antagonists in the MCU. I found this movie enjoyable. While it didn't blow me away it was definitely worthwhile and I would watch it again."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,all special effescts no real plot
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't give a shit about the reviews. Its a teenager super hero movie, its not an adult movie. Its fun, and the begining of a new era in the MCU."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A very Star Wars feel, just not as exciting or orginal. Kang was amazing in this movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun film exploring the Quantum Realm. The writing was not great with lines not meshing whether intentional or just poorly written. Apparently everyone can become a super hero which waters down the lore of it all. The ants stole the show and they were barely in the film.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. My only feedback is that it was too overly saturated with CG and cut scenes which was hard to follow. It reminded me of a Michael Bay transformers movie in terms of sensory overload. But I loved the storyline and Kang is definitely a more intriguing antagonist than Thanos IMHO.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie went above and beyond my expectations. It was hilarious, consistent, and neatly tied up the foundation for what it is clearly going to be a major villainous force. Kang is terrifying in ways Thanos could only dream of."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the action and the special effects.  It was mind blowing at times.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I really don't see why so many critics have it a poor score. Yrs is different than the previous two movies and it still has some funny and witty parts. The story was good and had great visual effects. I would recommend this film to my friends.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was a pretty fun movie
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie - it was visually beautiful, had a genuinely scary bad guy, made you question whether the ""defeat"" of the bad guy was actually a defeat, and had enough of a mix of action and non-action, suspense and humor, to be an amazing foray into Marvel's next phase."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Did not enjoy this movie. Very disappointing
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a huge Marvel fan, this did not let me down. Kang is here!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it's pretty good üëçüëç
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was the MCU Star Wars. It was great. Jonathan majors as Kang was excellent. I love how the MCU is able to take characters we love from the comics like MODOK, and fit them into the story they're telling. The MCU has a formula that works."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing and choosing to watch it in 4DX made it a lot more enjoyable
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kids, teenagers, and parents who like Marvel films will like this film."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie definitely doesn't have the charm of its predecessors but it's a required change of tone for antman and i am all for it. Love Kang!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I didnt think it was as bad as people say.  It wasnt as good as the prior movies but still a solid movie. I was entertained.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed it, don‚Äôt always go with what critics say, heard one say how fury road was the worst movie ever lol"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"QuANTuMANia was a brave choice to kick of Phase 5 of the MCU. 

In relation to fellow Phase starters, it was no Captain America: Civil War, but it was certainly better than Black Widow and Iron Man 3. 

Jonathan Majors shines as Kang, and this is his movie moreso than those named in the title, but everybody gets a chance to shine. 

The movie is more than a little CG-heavy, but it is set in the Quantum Realm so that is only to be expected. I feel as though the entire ‚Äòrebellion' storyline could have been jettisoned in lieu of time spent with the characters we wanted to watch. 

It was a good, but it was a few tweaks from great‚Ä¶"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme com a√ß√£o na medida certa, do in√≠cio ao fim. Qualidade padr√£o Marvel! Assistam e tirem sua pr√≥prias conclus√µes. Muito bom!!!!üëèüëèüëèüëè"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pel√≠cula es fresca , mezcla la diversi√≥n , la acci√≥n y el suspenso bastante bien. La entrega de Kang al universo genera una buena expectativa."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the fact that the quantum world was so colorful and diverse. It was definitely crazy seeing all the different variants and people in the quantumania world. Definitely loved the family values and principles when it comes to Scott and hope
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang is an awesome villain and each moment on the screen left me wanting more Kang. Modok was a surprise and pretty cool. He steals the show. Paul Rudd is great and while I'd have liked 10 more minutes of post snap Scott Lang, I felt like they did enough to get across his current life."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie! It showed Kang as a powerful being, but he's vulnerable and it still left the mystery if he is the good or the bad variant."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think criticts are just overhating it at this point, like how is this movie as bad as Eternals (which was carbage) i think its a great movie with a great villain. Although it of course has its problems its an absolute must see!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It felt like it was the 1st  movie since endgame to focus on the future and not the past.  And we finally  get a worthy  villain  .
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall entertaining, and a fine opening to phase 5 of the MCU. Jonathan Majors did a phenomenal job with acting, however his lines felt a bit underwhelming. Also did not feel as exciting or engaging as the previous two in the ant-man series, and the humor was mediocre at best."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"U think the 1st half of the movie was kinda awesome, neither the best not the worst. But this movie lost me in the 2nd half. Worst Climax. Kang deserves more respect."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the reclining seats, that was an awesome surprise. The movie was good but reminded me of Star Wars because of the different types of aliens."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"its no endgame, but it is a decent entry into the pantheon of MCU. MODOK was cheesy, kinda reminded me of the screaming goats from Thor."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Marvel Studios' Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania. Action packed!! Heartfull characters.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not exactly good or bad. It was there.  Marvel and their movies are getting a bit stale and this one is right there. Paul Rudd has some funny moments, but really you just don't care about this movie and what is happening.  If you have been watching the different Marvel TV series, they are more interesting and compelling. This really felt like a filler film to just sorta introduce a character [Kang] that was much better introduced in the Loki series.  You didn't care if any characters died in this because, well you just didn't care about the characters that weren't the main characters. There was no reason to feel emotionally involved at all in this.  The after-scenes felt more important than the previous 2h.  So I'd say wait until it hits Disney+ and skip the theatre release."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Honestly, this movie isn't as bad as people are saying it is. The main problem with this movie is that they are not able to set the right tone in certain scenes. The second act of this film is actually very solid, unfortunately the first and third act could have been much better. Aside from these setbacks, the film truely delivers a enjoyable time in the cinema. It is a fun, but not perfect, movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One word: boring. This film takes an age to get into the plot, conveniently segued by Marvel genius-kid scientist #2743, and even when you are in the thick of the action, it feels like nothing you haven't seen before in every other Marvel film. Even other Ant-Man films. The Quantum Realm is visually appealing and I praise the visual effects crews that poured a lot of time into it making look as otherworldly as it does, but this is indicative of a recent trend some blockbuster films seem to be falling into. A good, pull-you-in story will always triumph over eye-popping effects; Marvel cannot seem to get the balance consistently right anymore. If you took out the main villain of this film, Jonathan Majors' Kang the Conqueror, you really would be left with a rather sad affair, but not one far worse than what is already present here. The plot trundles along in predictable fashion; if you've seen any Marvel film, you know the drill. In fact, I would say that this film is the most ""MCU-ish"" of any MCU film. One-note characters, strange otherworld, big bad comes to ruin the day. Slap some hit-and-miss recurring jokes in and you've got the exact formula for practically any MCU film.

I struggle to recommend this except to the most diehard of Marvel fans; Paul Rudd just isn't there anymore and Michael Douglas' Hank Pym has been relegated to a sideshow. I also wanted more from the Quantum Realm itself, which for its supposedly physics-bending nature, acted rather normally. The best scene in the film comes when Ant-Man is forced to tackle the ""probability storm,"" so it is a shame we don't see more of that kind of creativity here. The potential was there to create something much more memorable than this, but it comes to nothing more than another forgettable Marvel sequel."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"An excellent movie. Enjoyed all of the characters, especially Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly and Jonathan Majors was a great villain."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good entertaining film, laughed at all the jokes, loved Majors' Kang, and a great set up for Phase 5. Quite enjoyed how they laid out Scott Lang's approach to life after Endgame. Good fun will watch again!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Collision between happy-go-lucky Scott Lang and future big-baddie Kang. Some things worked great, some things meh, but got there at the end.

Notable that the beginning needing to have the daughter arrested for a 'mostly peaceful protest'. For sure ticked off all sides for either pushing that vein or not pushing it enough. Wish movies just gave me an escape from that kind of nonsense.

Enjoyed the ride, humor and dialog probably aimed directly at teen/pre-teen audience and they hit the mark. Bring on the next phase of the Marvel journey!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good movie my kids also enjoyed it will gladly see it again.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,powerhouse performance from Jonathan Majors finally makes a Marvel movie feel important. Modok was also fantastic.  The protagonists are overshadowed but that's just fine.  awesome movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bad plot. Zero character growth. Like watching a star wars for kids. Disney must do better and thats coming from a huge marvel fan.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you've seen trailers for this and thought to yourself, 'looks good!' You won't be disappointed.  It's a little flat, emotionally, but otherwise I thought it was a fun adventure and I look forward to seeing it again."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Didn't like it, the story and the characters didn't make sense it's set a while after the end game movies yet it's like his never talked to his kid...."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jonathan Majors is great. Plot is mid. Should have gone direct to Disney+
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"- Amazing acting by Jonathon Majors (Kang, the Conqueror) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Janet Van Dyne)

- Why tf did this variant of Kang die? I dont like this choice.

- Quantum Realm is my least liked Marvel world. A blatant copy of the Star Wars themes.

- A lack of wow moments.

- The color grading in this film is downright terrible.

- VFX are pretty good, except for a few scenes.

- MODOK sucks real bad. The CGI on him is very very bad.

- Tried to be silly many times. It doesnt need to be silly.

- Half the humor doesnt land. But the other half is really good.

- Overall a forgettable film where the best thing were the end credits scenes. 

- Not the worst MCU movie. In fact, it is better than Antman and the Wasp, Thor 4 and even Black Widow in recent films."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"very good

xolum was the best character"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly I was pleasantly surprised! I thought this was gonna be as mid as it gets. Thanks to Jonathan Majors Kang performance, some VERY unique scenes that make creative use of Scotts abilities, and an actually pretty intense climax; however, and it pulled this movie to be something slightly beyond that. Great time! If your not a fan of Paul's character Matinee for sure."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing visuals, actors performances all round were really good, story line was great, action was good for cgi fights, overall a great start to phase 5"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The character of Kang (not the actor, he is clearly not very good) is the only good part of this movie along with some very nice looking visuals, apart from that, there is not much else. "
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was so good- great addition to the MCU and an awesome kickstart to the Multiverse Saga- can't wait for Johnathan Majors to portray more variants of Kang. People just hating and mad just to be mad.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow! I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I believed that this movie will significantly impact the future of the MCU. By the way, to fully appreciate the visual effects in this film, you must view it in 3D."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Another mesmerising imaginative fun roller coaster ride by Marvel.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Una pel√≠cula de superh√©roes del mont√≥n, chistes que quitan toda la tensi√≥n de la atm√≥sfera, efectos especiales muy pobres, mal gui√≥n y personajes inc√≥modos como MODOK.
Lo √∫nico rescatable fue la introducci√≥n de Kang pero a√∫n as√≠ le restaron mucho peso al personaje. 
Marvel nos ha tra√≠do excelentes trabajos y est√° pel√≠cula no es el caso."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun superhero movie, getting to know kang the conqueror. Who was played by an amazing actor!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie. It had all the feelings; funny, exciting,  joyful, kinda sad. There were things that surprised me. It was a fun ride.
Some movies I look at the time and check it. This movie kept my attention the whole way through."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Yani kang harcamƒ±≈ülar film sadece karƒ±ncanƒ±n macerasƒ± sadece filmin 2 ≈üeyi g√ºzel kang oyunculuƒüu bide grafikleri g√ºzeldi
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,An excellent start to phase 5. Go and see it you wont be dissapointed.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Thought it was going to be hokey and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it !
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, great acting."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Missing a certain 'Rudd'ness the other two had, Paul Rudd doesn't have a writer's credit in this one, so I guess that's it."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was absolutely amazing! It doesn't drag on at all and gets straight into the story, the first act slowly builds up, and we are introduced to the menacing Kang the Conqueror (played by Jonathan Majors). As soon as he steps foot into the movie, he steals the whole show, and this is where the movie reaches it climax point. The final battle is astonishing, the post credits left me wanting more and it is a perfect way to setup Kang Dynasty. The film was very fast-paced, so it didn't feel like it was 2 hours long! I had a few problems with MODOK, but he was still a decent character, and I think this was the right movie to introduce him in. Overall, 8/10!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No balance between humor and seriousness/intensity (similar to Thor, Love, and Thunder). Fight scenes were often muddled looking and was hard to track. 

Lore inconsistencies involving Kang the Conqueror's power capabilities (he was literally beaten by one of the weakest avengers and some ants), and MODOC's personalty was turned into a joke in comparison to his extremely unnerving personality and appearance in the comics. 

The movie was swimming in CGI, none of it was real. There was nothing at stake, you knew almost from the get-go that it was going to end well. Felt soulless and empty. Obvious scrap-booking based on poor editing between scenes.

In comparison to movies like Captain America and Iron Man, there was absolutely no emotional weight to the movie. I could've cared less about everything that had happened in Quantumania and my life would've been exactly the same had I not seen this movie. Felt like if fast food was a film.

All in all, I was NOT entertained. 2/10"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant Man movie Should be treated like ant man movie.If you are expecting You will see endgame in this movie,that will not happen.Very Much Enjoyable and Set up next Movies so good"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,At times it is entertaining and then at times its dull and not a very good movie. It isn't the best film Marvel have put out but it defiantly isn't the worse. It had some great moments and some not so great moments. Overall its kinda in the mid range for MCU films. Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd were stand out in this film and I really liked the Scott and Cassie Father Daughter due they had going on. I thought the CGI was great and a relief after some of the miss hits Marvel have had of recent times.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another boring marvel movie, by the end of the film I was glad it was over."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great, light-hearted entertainment."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cringe, for this movie better 0 star. and please stop this girl power"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome! Star Wars of the MCU and great kickoff to the Kang Dynasty. Watch Loki before you go and see the movie!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is a classic ""Antman"" movie, mainly focus on father-daughter interaction, showed how much the father care about his daughter (just like he did in Ant-man & Ant-Man and the Wasp), even when he stands in front of the super villain, Kang! 

This movie doesn't describing the quantum realm well, it doesn't explaining and not showing the overall picture of the quantum world.


However, it is a good comedy movie with serious story telling, and as usual, the character Antman doesn't have any super power like other Marvel heroes, so he uses his own way to fight against villains even if he can't beat them. The last battle scene is as 'wow' as the the battle scene of Endgame.

Not the best Marvel movie but it is still good to enjoy watching!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Probably the best Ant-Man so far. Funny, fresh and provoking from a certain point of view."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just thought it was average and didnt enjoy at all

"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A typical Ant-Man film, fun and quirky plus the edition of some new characters made the film a good watch, Kang was amazing and a good villain. Film seemed to be rushed with a slow build up and short ending cramped into 2 hours. Apart from that a great start to Phase 5."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite all of the stupid crap that Disney has been shoving down our throats, and all the hate coming from the anti-Disney, anti-MCU Youtuber crowd, I saw this with my family and friends tonight and came away happy. It was a good family, friendly flick with great visual, decent sound, and very poppy 3D effects. The story wasn't on Endgame level, but Ant-Man has never really been like that. It was better than the first two, so if you were happy with those, then you'll enjoy this. I was prepared for the worst after watching all the hate online but it really wasn't that bad at all. Even the whole ""socialism"" thing was a big nothing burger and that's coming from someone who can't stand what Disney has been pushing lately. MODOK stole the show, Kang was menacing, and I think although this wasn't some big, grand epic, it gave us a peak into what was coming next in the MCU. 

All I can say is don't trust the critics. go watch it for yourself. I think you'll be happy. It's a good, fun flick."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,My som and I enjoyed the movie.  It was far better than Eternals and more memorable than Thor- Love and Thunder.  I enjoyed the Star Wars feel of it and the humor.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie!!! I enjoyed it from being to end.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I made an account so I could leave a review. I was very suprised that critics are giving this movie a bad review. I really enjoyed it. It was very colorful, creative, the world is amazing, almost like a star wars movie. I laughed a few times in the theater, I think this was a good time!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst start for the MCU
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie.  Jonathan Majors was a stand out as Kang.  As was Michelle's role as Janet.  The critics got it wrong.  If you are looking for an entertaining movie.  See this!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movies is perfectly balanced for the whole cast, final battle was awesome."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visual Treat
Average Story
Kang catches the most screen"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie!! well, the main point is all about the quantum realm with Kang's variants and also more added characters who's already at the quantum realm. I hope Ant-man and the crew still be returning in some others shows or movies cause the super duper last part of the movie, its only Kang will be returning.. hmm I'm so excited for the future movies of MCU!!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me gusto la pel√≠cula, no es mala realmente. Sin embargo si falla con su mundo nuevo. Desperdiciaron a  M.O.D.O.K horriblemente pero as√≠ es marvel studios y disney. Extra√±e muchos personajes pasado pero la pel√≠cula s√≠ es entretenida y define lo que seguiremos viendo hasta llegar a Avengers Kang dinasty"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed the movie even if others say it's bad.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I think they could have done better
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw this on the weekend, and it's a good movie, really not sure what the critics are on about. You don't go into this thinking you are going to get Schindler's List, just leave your brain at the door and have fun with it... becuase it really is a fun movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"First things first, it's not as bad as the critics say. It's a good cgi action movie, with a few weird problems. 

Some good stuff: 
- The Kang actor's performance was amazing as we've already seen in Loki.
- usual fun stuff from Paul Rudd
- Some other funny scenes. 
- ... I'm trying here ...
- Bill Murray!

The bad stuff:
- The CGI was mostly good wven amazing but some things were really bad, like Modok's face, which takes you out of the immersion. 

- Getting major Star Wars vibes.

- The dialogues are horrible and wasp/Hope did not talk for at least 30 minutes of the movie. Just weirdly nodding and looking at the others.

- Janet not telling anybody anything is a plot device which makes no sense to the  viewer. ""I am trying to protect you"" she says. But i guess it's directed towards the viewer. She is trying to protect us from ""information""/spoilers xD
- Also very stupid deus ex machina plot devices."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Different from the first two, but similar in the funny. Great villain in Majors want to see ""more"" of him. As usual post credits are a must see."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Bien mais horrible √† la fois, il fait passer le temps mais au bout d'une heure j'ai totalement oubli√© que j'avais vu le film. C'est une honte au deux premiers films ant-man"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awasome and nice start of phase 5
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Trippy funny action packed and not too long. Wait til after all the credits for a surprise!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Thought these were supposed to be the funny MCU movies, rather than Paul Rudd in ""Taken."" I miss the old Cassie, new Cassie doesn't have the nostalgia, no chemistry with Rudd. The effects are fantastic, Johnathan Majors is excellent, and the second post credit scene was a much needed endcap."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Solid MCU experience - not breathtaking but certainly entertaining. Kang certainly carries the movie
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Above average marvel movie. Not the best, but better than I thought it was gonna be"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, entertaining. Step out of Ant Man's comfort zone and take a risk with an exploration into the microverse. Looking forward to seeing her again"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"ƒê·ªãt c·∫£ l√≤n m·∫•y con l·ª£n n√†y , xem th√¨ xem kh√¥ng xem th√¨ c√∫t , ƒë·ªãt c·∫£ l√≤ nh√† ch√∫ng m√†y lu√¥n , xem r·ªìi c√¢m ƒë·ªãt m·∫π m·ªìm ch√∫ng m√†y l·∫°i cho ng sau ng ta c√≤n xem , ƒë·ªãt m·∫π l√™n m·∫°ng s·ªßa ƒë·ªïng g·∫∑p ngo√†i ƒë·ªùi kh√©o ƒë√°i m·∫π ra qu·∫ßn"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,The writer made kang weak. Comic books and cartoons they needed the whole cast of avengers to defeat him. Antman is the weakest member.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, i liked the weirdness and alien feel. I liked the goofy theme, and the family theme. It felt like a gurps or besm game."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible and empty movie, the worst movie ever made by Marvel. There is nothing but a green-screen."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie overall. It was fast paced but not in a bad way. Modok was strange to see in live action, but that's expected from something straight out of the comics. It's something you get used to after a while so it's fine.Loved this movie definitely gonna watch it again!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie and the quality of the room, I had a good time."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I am not normally one for social media interaction considering the level of hate out here but considering the way MCU projects have been receiving so much flak as a die hard comics fan I had to speak in defense finally. I have watched the mcu movies since Iron man and with everyone seeing the new ways they incorporate existing canon from the comics while at the same time exploring alternate ways of doing things speaks to the creativity of the writing and directing staff in ways that are not always respected. For them to call back clear plot points even from the first movie seeing the growth and dynamic change of existing relationships between main characters and the after credits scene that calls in to question the validity of how evil is the bad guy really by comparison I felt very moved and optimistic about the rest of the movies going forward as well as the shows for returning seasons I only hope the real fans such as myself that know the easter eggs the nuances and the possibilities they create with each new iteration aren't drowned out by the trolls who like things in the past and don't want to see their worlds change especially considering the lack of diversity amongst the negative critics who don't seem to give any positive feedback only negative and hate on something I have loved since it's founding maybe some of them should stay considering new careers.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"With lots of great performances, it's a complete movie. Particularly Jonathan majors. The major problems that occur in Phase-4 are being resolved clearly."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome! Best since ragnorak
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel‚Äôs story telling and lack of direction in recent projects is most exemplified within this movie. Overall writing was poor and lacked suspense
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I find it hard to align the critic's view of this film with the ACTUAL film - Especially when you compare it to the messy Frankenstein's monster of a plot of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, that seems to be the darling of this channel's Critics.

So there's some in-jokes that callback to the first two Antman films, but they don't get in the way of the narrative or direction; And the cast - Kathryn Newton, Evangeline Lilly and Paul Rudd especially, deliver their roles immaculately with not a move or a line wasted. Jonathan Majors gives a stunning forceful performance easily on par with Angela Bassett's in BPWF (IMHO). 

Unlike much of the Phase 4 which was confused and over-reaching, Quantumania was a joyous, well balanced and highly entertaining third part to a hugely underrated MCU trilogy. And unlike it's Phase 4 counterparts, it didn't over do the humour, plot points moved along with elegantly succinct dialog and the cinematography was beautiful.

Given it's complex backstory and ideas, Quantumania does a brilliant job of telling a fast paced and entertaining narrative, introducing characters with real purpose rather than just as a MacGuffin to 'shoe horn them into the MCU franchise' (Riri Williams' flimsy introduction in Wakanda Forever or Dane Whitman into Eternals for example).

This is an energised, epic and classy start to phase 5. Go watch it, sit back, relax and savour the spectacle!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was an enjoyable movie. Don't believe the critics.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Super fun to watch! Beautiful scenery and honest connection between actors. Well done 
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this film!! Had some really funny parts.. and antman's daughter looks like an amber herd doppelg√§nger.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It wasn't anything special but it was enjoyable. I think it is probably worth a watch.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this movie and its a lot better than recent marvel movies /TV.  Really don't get all the negativity..
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Took over an hour for Kang to even show up.  Then the movie had 53 minutes to resolve whatever storyline it tried to begin. A real stinker
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,My son & I love the special effects and the detail of the story. It was hilarious too
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,We could barely se the movie cause it looks too dimmed
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Guys please don't care the critic reviews 
Honestly the movie is really entertaining and good and you will really enjoy the movie and the post credit scenes are really lit so don't miss this movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics got it wrong again. This movie was great.  Paul Rudd was excellent as always. Jonathan Majors  is truly the Conqueror. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer did their thang. Evangeline Lilly is always on point. Kathryn Newton was alright. I prefer the actress that played Casey in the last movie, to tell you the truth."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"See it, so you can say you saw it."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty much what i expected from an Ant Man movie, there were good stakes, surprises and timely comedy. And i believe it sets up Kang perfectly for the upcoming movies"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, I really really enjoyed this movie.  My Sunday was not going too good.  I decided to  go watch this movie.  Easily the most entertaining movie so far this year.  Kang the conqueror is definitely going to be a major problem for the MCU..  stick around for the after credits to see why!  Kangs obsession with time relates to all of us and that power is something any one of us would dream of having."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It‚Äôs ok. Nothing crazy. Ok to watch ok to skip 
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This is blockbuster movie
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kang the tech god, the conqurer didnt do much conqurering. He was conqured by a bunch of ants. For a guy who has been distroying universes that shouldny have happened"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"For die-hard comic fans, this movie will probably not cater to you. However, as one who enjoys both the comics and the MCU as well, I did enjoy the movie. There were introductions to characters that felt a little off or placated because Ant-Man movies are generally more of the light-hearted bunch of the MCU projects. Kang does carry a good amount of action, showing us a fraction of his power and what could be more to come. The movie does do a good job of getting me excited for the launch of Phase 5."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great way to introduce Kang. Movie overall was interesting the entire time.  I would give it 8-10.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Ambitious. Fun watch.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ok now that I've saw this twice! I thought some (not all) of the CGI was amazing! Especially Kang's empire and the Ants mega empire. They could have did better with the quantum realm as a whole. It was very Pixar to me. To all of my stoner friends please go see the movie high! In my opinion it was Star Wars CGI meats Pixar combined. Which indeed gave you that acid drop feel. A lot of the creatures were too cartoon like TO ME. I will say Johnathan Majors, Michelle Pffiefer, and Michael Douglas carried this movie on their backs! The movie as a whole was a solid Marvel movie and set the stage for what's to come in stage five. Make sure you stay for two mid credit scenes. I must have enjoyed this movie if I saw it twice. I give it a solid B"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"kang was an absolute menace, Jonathan Majors plays kang very well and i enjoyed the movie. I loved the post credit scene as well and i cant wait for what the future brings."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,marvel movie have gone down hill this one is OK better than most recent one except spider man
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Greatly enjoyed the hard sci-fi lean. strong acting in this one, and a somewhat compelling villain. devolved into a massive fight at the end and just a few too many subplots. Appreciated how some previous story threads were tied up."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Graphics out of this world
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was below expectations, no character development, bad sense of humor, weird cuts."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,8/10 really good comedy.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"As the opening phase 5, this film is quite good. Kang the Conqueror's character is very dominating when compared to Cassie Lang's character. The downside of this film is that the chemistry between Newton and Paul Rudd is less visible"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it! Kept my attention,  it's a movie just to enjoy and escape reality for a little bit!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The 3 part of this saga is a full story in the Quantum level. Exciting till the end. And with top-class actors. 5 Stars Thank you Peyton Reed and Kevin Feige
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked all the crazy SFX that the team put into this movie. The action was great and was definitely a great time for any MCU fan!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it.  Kang was awesome.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Note : If you haven't watched Loki Series, there is no point of you watching this movie and come here to give a negative review.

To understand this movie , multiverse and all about Kang the conqueror you must watch Loki Series to understand the concept.

Movie starts a bit slow with mixture of humour and fun. The second half of the movie is amazing.

Goosebumps moment: when the Ants come at war with the team.

We have 2 post credit scene. One which shows all the other variants of Kang ( again to understand this u should have watched Loki series)

2nd post credit scene goes on where Loki and Mobious go on to find another variant of Kang (should have watched Loki series to understand this)

As a whole it is a good movie compared to all the other phase 4 movies."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was straight up awesome, not perfect but awesome"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it a lot. but where's Luis!?
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena, me encant√≥"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's was weird, and craziest ever, but the whole hype and CGI was good. While the movie logical was weak, some of it just without any explanation. The family issue of Ant man still the there, and some star wars hype. Kang was absolutely a 
great & cool villian, just the way he die was too easy. Overall still consider a acceptable movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I thought the third Ant-Man movie was a bit of a disappointment. In my opinion, I think it is not the best-written movie of the MCU. Most of the lines sounded as if a fifth grader wrote them. The CGI was excellent although a couple of scenes did look a little funky. Another thing was that there was no character development for any of the characters besides Janet. Jonathan Majors put on a fantastic performance as Kang. I can not wait to see him again in the upcoming movies. Was hoping this movie to be good but unfortunately, it was just an OK movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As is the case with all Marvel movies these days, Antman 3 relies too heavily on CG of both characters and settings, All scenes with Kang, however, were performed superbly and were just barely enough to salvage the movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was probably the best non Spider-Man related thing since Endgame. The negative reviewers want a gender/race/sexuality based story and can't help but complain if something is vaguely familiar, as if franchises and pre established stories can't exist as they already are. But please, give us the next fill in the blank Lion King ripoff as long as you can get off to the idea that it offends someone you disagree with. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies üçø"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Definitely the better of the Ant-Man trilogy. I wouldn't re-watch it again, and if you are someone who is thinking of waiting for this movie to stream in Disney+ then you should probably wait for it to hit streaming.
There were no stakes for MCU's next big bad, although Jonathan Majors was amazing with his performance as Kang I felt it would have been more enticing if Kang killed of Hank Pym. Catherine Newton's Cassie was mid, honestly I think Emma Furhman would have been a better Cassie.
Overall a decent pass time but MCU should definitely start hiring better writers to write better scripts, because that is were MCU is falling short."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining movie, Johnathan Major's delivered such an incredible performance, and the Paul Rudd humor worked really well! Story was a tad generic with its Marvel formula, but it was still very enjoyable, with several standout scenes! Wanted more Bill Murray though."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Film ini sesuai kapasitas nya Ant-Man sebagai superhero yang tidak bermodalkan kekayaan, kekuatan khusus dari lahir, atau bahkan keturunan dewa. Tetapi Ant-Man mampu dan berani utk melawan Kang. Tidak terlalu banyak drama, tidak terlalu banyak jokes, dan yang terpenting tidak ada unsur LGBT nya."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It had the perfect amount of action and comedy with a great story kind and cliffhanger
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I liked the first Ant Man. This 3rd film seems to have lost everything that made that first film enjoyable. It takes place in a world where nothing seems to matter, the stakes are not there, and it is very much a cgi world that is like watching a video game.

Filled with a lot of jokes that don't land or tonally do not fit. 
The movie seems more intent on pushing not so subtle political messages from about the 5 minute mark and sprinkled throughout rather than telling a fun story. 
A lot of the dialogue came across as if a 12 year old wrote it. 

Positives: its colorful, Paul Rudd is still Paul Rudd, and it has enough crap going on that it'll get our ADHD society to stop looking at their phone for 2 hours."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"decent movie, good introduction for Kang. Really like Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer acting. Basic Rebellion against an Overlord plot, with a subpar ending. Cassie was my favorite character, want more of her 6.5/10"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think that Kang is a great character and I'm excited to see more of him/his variants. Jonathon Majors does an incredible job portraying Kang; very calculated and menacing while still oozing with personality. Paul Rudd was enjoyable as always and I think he did a really good job with this movie. His character is funny but not exhaustingly so where I'm rolling my eyes - which I've found with a lot of recent marvel films. I thought the story was good, it was easy to follow but I would've liked to see more Kang and less of the whole freedom fighters thing though I did still enjoy those characters. Michelle Pfeiffer‚Äòs Janet has never really been my cup of tea, I think she's a very one-note character with not a lot of dimension; just a plot device really. I think this movie was a good start to the Kang dynasty and one of the better projects marvel has put out recently in my opinion, worth the watch."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente filmaci√≥n, la actuaci√≥n de Paul Rudd es impecable, sorprendente y atrapante, como siempre."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!! One of my favorite marvel movies to date. The humor and action was awesome and lang and modak were bad ass!! My favorite ant man movie by far
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun from start to end, good amount of action and comedy mixed in."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"When are Marvel going to realise that we are all aware that there is only one storyline that drives all of their movies . Ant Man is no different . You have seen it all before so it comes down to the characters, the casting and the  comedy . Judge that for yourselves but expect nothing new"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Soooooooo stipid diaologue.  I rolled my eyes so much; they started to hurt.  And jonathan Majors is was so overrated in this movie, such a downgrade from thanos."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,So good!! The fight scenes were awesome! The designs/graphics were so good!! There‚Äôs a lot of funny parts too!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Yeah so there's a scene in there that's a flashback that ruins not only the movie but the entire trilogy. This movie sucks
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun movie! Pretty bad writing and directing was ehhhh but I really enjoyed it solely due to the cast. Please make as many antman films as you can. While this was a disappointment I would watch a Paul Rudd as this character in the worst movie. I just love him in the role so much
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice set up for the next phase.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Once again forget the critics. This was a very entertaining and well put together Marvel film that reminded me how nice it feels to walk out of good entertaining MCU stories. One of the best comic movies since the last Spider-Man. Good story, funny, and great scenes and action‚Ä¶ also like how they brought MODOK to life and gave him some character. Definitely recommend to see in the Theaters."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It's completely opposite to the critics reviews....
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a proper introduction to the great and terrible Kang.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The fact that the audience score is 84% really shows hardcore Marvel fans will eat up anything put in front of them... The movie is boring all round. Kang is cool, but that is really the only good thing about this. Literally nothing memorable happens."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Martin Scorsese's views on comic book movies are no secret; he claims they are more like theme park rides than true cinema. For years, I have staunchly disagreed with this stance, I love the Marvel Cinematic Universe and found so much to appreciate in their films. But after seeing Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, y'know what?¬†

He might be right.

It pains me to say this, but Quantumania is not a great film. To be clear, I enjoyed the movie. I'd even give it a thumbs up! But it is a fun movie, not a good one. It is, by all accounts, a theme park ride.¬†

And frankly, that disappoints me.¬†

I come to Marvel for the characters I love, the heart and emotion in the stories, and yes, for the fun superhero action. Infinity War and Endgame were such huge successes not because of how fun they were but because of how they captured people's imaginations and emotions. People felt tied to the characters and couldn't wait to see them all come together. I for one, was so emotionally invested in those films, and all of Marvel at the time.

Why do I bring that up? Well, because I felt nothing while watching Quantumania. There is no emotional weight to it, nothing compelling me to invest myself in the story. It is all spectacle, and no substance. I felt so empty coming out of it. It felt so forgettable and I never seemed to actually get into the movie. I just couldn't buy into what it was doing. And I am so crushed to say this, because I was looking forward to this movie so much! I really wanted to love it, but alas, it is the first Marvel movie in a while that I have come very close to not liking.

I love the first Ant-Man film, and its sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp has even grown on me over the years. This one felt nothing like them. An Ant-Man film it is not, lacking the spirit and everything else that made the franchise what it was. It is completely different, and delves into very odd corners of the MCU. Doing this isn't a bad thing, but I mourned the loss of the charm that the first two films had. I loved the small-scale heist plots. I loved the simple narrative of a dad trying to get more time with his daughter. I loved the unique action set-pieces; battles taking place on a toy Thomas the Tank Engine, or using a Hello Kitty PEZ dispenser as a weapon. I loved Michael Pe√±a's character, Luis, and his awesome storytelling! It had this really heartfelt and likeable element to it, and was different from what we were used to in the rest of the MCU. Yes, the films did serve as a sort of ""palate cleanser"" after the big Avengers films, but that worked for them! I think the decision to make the third Ant-Man film an ""Avengers-level event"" movie was a mistake, because that essentially forced them to get rid of everything that made these films special. (Including Michael Pe√±a which I will never forgive.)¬†

And I gotta blame director Peyton Reed here. He bit off more than he could chew. I can understand wanting to do one of the bigger Marvel movies as the Ant-Man ones are on the smaller side of the universe, but forcing the Ant-Man franchise to become one of the major events was a big mistake. It didn't work. Frankly, Peyton Reed was operating in his niche with the first two films, and he's just completely out of his element with this one. You can tell he is trying so hard to make it a big sci-fi spectacle, but comes up short in almost every way. He just got a little too ambitious. Tonally the film is all over the place, the pacing doesn't make sense, action scenes are cut together really oddly and the film overall seems to have no vision. It just sort of exists. Even with the action scenes, there are no memorable moments, and frankly there were barely any real action scenes in the film.

The problem is this is an Ant-Man film with no real story for Ant-Man. He feels miscast in his own story, heck, it was unnecessary for him to even be there, and the film never truly explained why he could take on Kang. I just never believed any of it. The film lacked verisimilitude, in terms of character, plot and world-building.¬†

Jeff Loveness really needed someone else here to help flesh out his script. It feels like a shell of a great movie. Dialogue isn't great, for one, but that's minor. There are lots of moments that work, but they never add up to anything. There is never any weight to what happens either, it felt like things would happen with no setup or reasoning at all, they just would happen because they had to in order to progress the plot. It's a very by-the-numbers plot that barely holds up and steals so much from other films such as Star Wars. The structure of the film is a mess too, with no discernible 3-act structure ‚Äî the characters end up in the Quantum Realm, stuff happens, and then all the sudden we're at the end. It just felt like there was no buildup, no real reason for this story to be told. Heck, I try to think back on this movie and it's just a jumbled blur of colours and meaningless content. It's so forgettable and lifeless. It's such a missed opportunity for a great Ant-Man story. Frankly, there were missed opportunities throughout the entire film, and most of the issues stem from the writing.

The worst thing is that I'm here complaining about the movie when there were still so many things I liked about it! I can genuinely see how some audiences are enjoying it more than I did, as many standalone elements I really liked and even loved! The problem is, they just never came together to make me love them all as a final product. I liked many of the creative ideas offered up, I really liked the visuals of the Quantum Realm (even if you could very much tell it was shot on green screen/the volume), I liked seeing all the new and returning characters and cast members (Paul Rudd is fantastic and charming as always (too bad he didn't have more to do here), Michelle Pfeiffer is awesome here, and I really liked Kathryn Newton as a grown up Cassie), and I LOVED Kang.

Before I go into anything else let me make one thing very clear: Jonathan Majors is INCREDIBLE as Kang the Conqueror.

There are some amazing actors in this movie, including Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer, but Jonathan Majors puts them all to shame. He truly carries the movie; the only times I truly found myself invested were when he was on screen. He is operating leagues above everyone else! He is so menacing and truly embodies the threat of Kang. I was completely blown away by his performance, he stole the entire movie and then some! Truthfully, he was so compelling I found myself almost rooting for him! Kang was even a fantastically written character, he worked the best out of any character in the film and I am super interested to see how they handle both Kang and Majors in the future. But my god, Jonathan Majors can truly do no wrong, he is giving an emotionally acrobatic performance that this film and franchise does not deserve. 

I love Marvel, I really do. It's why I'm being so critical of their missteps when they happen, because I don't want to have to write this again. But they need to step up their game. I want to head into the next few films and love them! Quantumania had so much potential and because of that it's ultimately a disappointment, despite how entertaining it is. And it highlights greater issues with the Marvel machine right now; the cracks are starting to show.

Has the magic of the MCU finally worn off?

I really hope not. But Quantumania worries me."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a complete escapist blast
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Massively great movie
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite the super weird M.O.D.O.K CGI, I think it's a good movie to enjoy."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme √© legal assim como o outros da franquia homem fomiga. N√£o espere coisas surpreendentes espere um filme comum. As piadas s√£o no contexto certo sem exagero, asssisti 2 vezes e curti."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun movie, but not quite as great as the first two.  Fun to go back to the Ant-Man world though"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was fun but that's about it
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie!! Highly recommend!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant man always does it! Great movie
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had fun in this. Some good jokes, interesting story and Kang was chiefs kiss! Would recommend a watch!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring plot. Not too thrilled about the character development.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was funny and entertaining‚Ä¶but where was Luis?!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was way better than I ANTicipated! Lol no seriously tho. I don't get the hate this movie is getting. It was pretty good! Good pacing, good acting, good action, not too jokey."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Acting was meh, lines and scenes were too predictable, and story was kind of weak/lazy"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Nothing special for a marvel movie. Unfortunately Kang isn't the big bad he's been promoted as. Story isn't compelling. No high stakes. CGI and world building are turned up to 11 but can hardly care about it because of the story.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Not perfect but thoroughly enjoyable.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a good movie. Fun and good action. Better than Thor: Love and Thunder. Not as good as Spiderman: No Way Home.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"fun movie, much better than expected from critics review.  worth watching in theaters"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Some of the editing was strangeall of a sudden they were in a ship or how did they get from one spot to the next
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have no idea why this movie has such a low critics score, it was rad as fuckü§ò"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Almost fell asleep a few times and I am a marvels fan :(
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie loved it.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, very entertaining. I liked it a lot, nice addition to the MCU."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is not going to carry everyone along for the ride. And maybe that's ok. I don't think there was any escaping the weirdness of the Quantum Realm for some. You're either going to love or hate it. But it was done well. Everyone got a moment. And I don't understand why such the nasty comments about the plot. This was never going to be the quirky, wacky lightheartedness of the previous two AntMan installments. There are some clear bars met for what this film needs to be. Jonathan Majors was brilliant and anyone thinking negatively about the ending, have we not all learned from Marvel's pattern? Just you wait. I must admit I was a bit confused at how the ending came together but ultimately, I see where they are headed and I'm still sold on it, extra thanks in part to two stellar post credit scenes. I think the problem many may find, is that if you're not up on the extensive lore and comic plot lines there may be little more than an amazing cast doing things you just don't quite understand. But if you understand it, we're right on target y'all. This was not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Go see it!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although not perfect still an enjoyable entry in the growing MCU. Loved all the actors they all did an amazing job especially Johnathan majors as Kang, cant wait for his return and i must say this film was absolutely visually stunning my imagination ran wild from beginning to end with each scene, so aside from a couple cringe worthy moments this movie is far better than critics are saying."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this was a fun ride and just a blast to watch. I thought the visuals were outstanding, some of the best Marvel's produced, and Kang was really intimidating and a great villain! Also, the fact that he's not the strongest to come, yet he still. was really powerful, just shows how powerful Kang could be! Paul Rudd was, as always, amazing as Ant-man, and I thought Janet was a really good inclusion. I love MODOK and I thought he was hilarious! All in all, the story was solid, the visuals were great and Kang carried!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good thing I don't listen to critics as this movie was a lot of fun. Antman previously had felt pretty low stakes in terms of villians, but certainly not the case here. Movie still manages to keep humour throughout.

Great start to phase 5."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not funny. Not good. No substance. Paul Rudd was charming like always and Jonathan Majors is a great actor. The credit scene made me excited for more Kang but those are the only positive things I have to say about the movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,If you don't enjoy big Bombastic scifi spectacle with a few small laughs why are you still going to see a Marvel Studios film? Have you ever read a Marvel comic? Do you enjoy a core story about family? I am the target audience and just gotta applaud the amount of work put in by the visual effects artist. I cannot wait to see Kang again.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm not sure why all the hate from critics. This movie was exactly what I expected it to be and enjoyed every minute of it. Far better than Thor Love and Thunder or Wakanda Forever.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie.  Good connection.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is interesting and moves at a good clip. Very Fantastic Voyage, which I super loved. And then Kang comes fully into the story and he's amazing. I have a few complaints but they're TRIVIAL. Great movie. Phase 5 off to a great start."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Entertaining, fun film."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great acting and really enjoyable
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall good, entertaining marvel comic book movie.  It takes a deeper dive into another realm outside the multiverse and some familiar characters finally make their big screen debut.  Paul Rudd and cast put on a pretty good acting performance and it's fun watching Ant-Man and crew working together to try to save the day.  Some of the theories and concepts used can go over the head of some of the general fan base but as long as you try not to think to hard about it, you will be able to enjoy it."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the movie can‚Äôt wait to watch again‚Ä¶. Wish I can watch again!!!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Antman and the Wasp: Quartermania is a movie...that I watched. 

It's not bad. It's not great either. It has a disturbing lack of Michael Pena in it. 

It was just an average, generic CGI meh fest."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't isten to the critics, this movie was fantastic!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie stuck more to the source material than the previous movies
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was meh , a bit Boring, I like Kang but wanted to see him fight more. Antman daughter is annoying . Your dad saved the world and you givin him sh*t because he wants to enjoy his peace üò´. Modok CGI was beyond terrible. He didn‚Äôt have the voice or nothin major let down "
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie, and loved the chemistry between Kathryn Newton and Paul Rudd, Michelle Pfeiffer was awesome too with some epic fight scenes. Michael Douglas as Hank Pym finally had some cool moments to shine, I loved the Bill Murray cameo and the inclusion of Corey Stoll as MODOK AKA Darren Cross which I thought was hilarious. And of course Jonathan Majors was incredibly menacing as Kang I literally felt a sense of dread the entire movie! I don't understand the bad critic reviews to be honest, it was just as good as the last Ant Man movie and the best MCU project since Spider-Man No Way Home. The mid credit scene was awesome and I loved the Loki teaser at the end, overall I'd say this movie is a must watch and I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure what the critics were thinking.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I've been a bit down on Phase 4, but thought this movie was on par with pre Endgame movies. 4 1/2 stars from me."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It's great to opening new phase and intro of how dangerous Kang can be
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's a great time!!!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good scenes, the history is very topical, and the ending is quite unexpected and disappointing. The post credit scenes are good though"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"As far as entertainment goes, I am entertained. 
Visuals, enjoyed it.
Story, enjoyed it, there might be some scenes that needs a rewatch to better understand it.
I hope this is not the conclusion for Scott Langs Antman, I'm excited for the sequel!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The introduction of Kang was good. The movie was overall nice but wasn't that groundbreaking as everyone was expecting. But we have to understand that this is the beginning of a new phase and a new dynasty and a new villain. So they have set everything up for the bigger game. I enjoyed the movie what so ever.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The balance between comedy and action was pretty much perfect. Paul Rudd was great as usual, and Kathryn newton as Cassie was a great change and she brought a lot of personality and life to a character who was pretty boring before. The setup for future marvel projects is awesome and Kang is being set up as a much more interesting and deep villain than thanos ever was. Definitely a must watch :)"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great introduction to kang and all and all a great ant man movie don‚Äôt go off the critic score my personal opinion is it was better than Thor but still a good overall movie 
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I will not say it's a waste of time but this movie really works when Jonathan majors is in play but also works during humour. Was it the right place to use humour who knows . The script is ok I guess , Rick and morty writers are the worst there is for movies Doctor strange 2 ant man 3 and series I guess after she hulk"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this movie was a ton of fun all around. It expanded the greater MCU in both location and character. I felt like the stakes felt high, but were different than what we had seen in the past. The side characters were compelling. it was also the first post-Avengers solo movie where it made sense that there wasn't any help for our heroes."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It‚Äôs Paul Rudd need not say anymore. Lol
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great flick. Perfectly good addition to MCU and we get a great M.O.D.O.K.!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was good I don't understand the hate ‚Ä¶ they were a couple things that were meh but over all it was a good movie ‚Ä¶ Jonathan majors really carried this movie he's going to be an incredible villain moving forward
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,great visual and audio effects. Perfect way to introduce the next MCU villian.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely a fun movie. The family and I enjoyed the film. A few things kinda bother me as far as MODOK's CGI and some other's but over all it is in now way a show stopper for me.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Watching it in 4DX will definitely enhance your experience! Kang was awesome!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"WAY better than the ""critics"" lead you to believe. This was a fun movie akin to GOTG Vol 2. There's a lot of story being told here in just 2 hours. I appreciate that. That creates some MINOR narrative gaps; get over it and wait for the deleted scenes. This movie is better than 80% of the dreck you'll find in the theaters. And for the haters who just can't stand that their chosen profession requires them to watch Marvel movies, I refer you to Cassie Lang's stinger, ""It's never too late‚Ä¶"""
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun movie to watch
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie and want to see it again in 3D
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Kang should've won, felt a little too ex machina"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was a good movie. Great action, had outstanding female leads, and was funny."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"One of the worst marvel movies, very bad script and acting. Very good villain and acting from him. I would rate it lower if it wasn't for the villain."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was AMAZING!! Kang is an awesome bad guy along with MODOK. Great visual effects.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the visuals, just a little confusing"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was good, idk what people expected considering it was based in the quantum realm."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"We saw Quantumania first weekend, in theater.  We hadn't bothered seeing a Marvel film in theater for a while, but I had a feeling about this one.

Quantumania reminded me more of the first phase MCU films. Definitely building on something but very much its own film.

The rendering was good (and there was a lot of it) with fine detail, decent textures the environment generally followed its own internal rules. The things that should have weight did, which is something that digital effects often get wrong.  I'm not sure why anyone would complain that the effect fell short.  They definitely did not.

The ""socialism"" speech was a line and a half (cut off), hardly the soliloquy some have been complaining about.

All the main characters were fleshed out and each one had their moments.

The pacing was decent. There were points of high action and points that let the viewer breathe.

Kang... The Kang at the end of Loki was a disappointment and I didn't think Jonathan Majors was the right person for the part. But in this film. He was totally Kang. He completely owned the part. Majors was the Kangiest. He sold me. He is my new favorite supervillain.

What surprised me was that they took such pains to recreate all the visual cues of Kang the Conqueror from a forty year old comic. The suit, the faceplate, the forcefields and other tech -- right out of the comic. Call them memberberries if you wish, but they totally worked.

Bill Murray does his usual fifteen minute cameo but it didn't really feel forced this time. His character helped fill in backstory and moved the plot forward and he wasn't so... Bill Murray.

The film wasn't ""woke"", nor was it ""not-woke"". It didn't make any special effort to artificially elevate female characters or deconstruct male characters. There were three female leads (four if you count the rebel leader), they all had critical parts to play, and it all happened organically. The daughter wasn't magically perfect, she got better with the tech as the movie progressed, earning her later successes.

No wonder the critics hated it.

At the time I'm writing this, the audience score is 84%. I would have rated it higher. It's possible that recent Marvel properties have set the bar so low that this film seems better than it actually was. But I don't think that's true. This was a good Marvel film and Disney/Marvel deserves a nod for making it happen."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie has an identity crisis: it's not sure what it wants to be.

I saw a family team up movie, a sci-fi movie, a world building quantum realm movie, a father-daughter movie, you name it.

Was it good? Sometimes.
Was it disappointing? Less than expected.
Is it a good movie? Not sure..
Is it a bad movie? No.

So yeah.. it's a hot mess, but still okay.
When it's good, it's actually good.
When it's bad you start wondering who approved the script..

Do I recommend it to watch? Yeah, it's still kinda fun.

It's called a not-that-bad movie.
It's not a good movie, but it's not a Morbius neither. 

So you know? Whatever, maaan.."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Stoked to have seen it in IMAX and 3D.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It wasnt as bad as I was expecting. Other than Spider Man, this whole phase has been horrible. Even the last Thor was a huge miss."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is the worst MCU movie ever made.
Disney is destroying Marvel"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It had the perfect amount of comedy and it had tons of action. The story was just amazing. Kang was possibly the best villian we have seen other than Thanos. Ant-mans relationship was perfect with his daughter, hope, hank, and Janet. And M.O.D.O.K was perfect. Overall a 10 out of 10 I really suggest this movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,From top to bottom Ant-Man and the Wasp quantumaina was fantastic and is brilliantly and masterfully done. This movie  gave a truly different perspective and vision from the first two Ant-Man movies  that was refreshing to see. The two last ending credits where also exciting and keeps you in angst for whats to come down the road. Great job too the cast and crew of this movie and to Kevin Feige.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was fantastic, which makes the Ant-Man trilogy one of the best marvel trilogies so far since it hasn't failed once (in my opinion). It did lack what the other Ant-Man movies had that made me love them so much, but that didn't make it any less enjoyable. Ant-Man is a really underrated character and I'm glad this movie came out to show his potential. It had plenty of great story and jokes, and I'm glad we got to explore the quantum realm more. This movie deserves more appreciation. The Ant-Man movies really were great."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incr√≠vel, te deixa preso ao filme do in√≠cio ao fim, algumas pessoas pensem que talvez falte protagonismo de alguns personagens mas achei equilibrado"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Decent. a little too heavy on special effects. but not bad. Story ok, acting good, effects ok."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Thought it was a solid film. Kang was the best, Jonathan Majors knocks it out the park. M.O.D.O.K could have been handled with a little more care. Excited to see where the overall story goes from here."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall it was a great movie, and Paul Rudd is fantastic. Im docking half a star for the peaceful protesters line, the socialism line, and Evangeline Lilys terrible boyish haircut."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was okay. Had pretty good visuals, but followed the basic Marvel formula. Kang was definitely the highlight and really the only standout."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"While not the greatest of Marvel's recent catalogue, it soars above the likes of Black Widow and Eternals, and though it takes the Ant-Man franchise in a wildly different direction, it is an overall solid film with an incredible villain that lives up to the pre-Endgame MCU."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics hate it. But audiences love it. Show that critics hv different taste from audiences.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Es una pel√≠cula entretenida con un ambiente interesante, pero si tiene problemas en el gui√≥n y algunas actuaciones no me gustaron"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm really baffled by the extraordinarily harsh reviews of this movie. I thought Paul Rudd was his usual charming and witty self. As the launch of phase 5, this movie adequately left me excited for what Kang will do next. Also dreaming of a movie where Cassie, Yelena, and Kate Bishop become mean girl superheroes. Liked it enough to see it twice during opening weekend. It's not epic as in Endgame or Civil War, but as a stand-alone film with just one Avenger, I thought it was a lot of fun."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bill Murray completely wasted. Kang's arc was perfect but the ending leaves you unsatisfied. The film had all the potential to be much more serious and physically more interesting, but it was not, they approached everything with the repetitive humor of Marvel with a script at the level of the children's public, which is nothing wrong but they could have taken advantage of it to promote interest in quantum physics. The only thing that the movie introduces to the MCU is the addition of Cassie as a new young avenger, nothing more."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel meets Star Wars!
Kang is an incredible actor!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,fantastic movie!!!!! best movie in phase 5!!!!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally getting back to a serious MCU movie! Hopefully this will be what this franchise needed to get back on track.  See you in the multiverse.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved it!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well what can I say? In my opinion the movie is good and that's it, everything is ok! It's not a master piece, but I liked it, sometimes I even thought it was a star wars new movie because the quantum reign looks like a Star wars movie in some scenes, but this made the movie cooler in my opinion."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Surprisingly good.   Very funny
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I found this movie to be a great start to phase 5 of the MCU. Honestly don't understand the hate the movie is getting. They worked hard to make it good and I felt it was decent enough.  I'm a film major so I've seen a lot of movies and I felt this was a decent movie for the story and characters they have.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The Marvel movies are slowly going down hill but I still enjoyed the movie
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the humor (but the other 2 Ant Man movies have more funny parts).
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dumb and chaotic. Paul Rudd was barely used for what he is good at...comedy. Weakest villain in any Marvel movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Brilliant!! Don't listen to the haters. And definitely don't listen to the critics. Definitely in my top 10 list forsure!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man 3 is super fun and does a great job delving into a new dimension (the quantum realm). MODOK and Kang are absolutely fantastic, and seeing how Scott and Cassie have grown over the years is exciting and endearing. You can tell how fluent Scott has become with the shrinking tech by now while Cassie is still a beginner, and seeing them tag team now is awesome (especially when you look back at when Cassie was a little girl with how much she admired her dad)."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was fun, enjoyable, Johnathan majors is amazing as Kang. Modok was pretty cool, but ruined him. But to say this movie matches the eternals on the tomatometer is insulting. Quantum was wayyyyyyy more enjoyable then the god awful eternals"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Took the lord's name in vane several times
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good movie. Funny with some not Soo funny moments. The ending was very weird and awkward for what's to come. Didn't make since but we shall see
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love Paul Rudd and Antman, but this movie was not it.  Poor writing and generally, just too 'wierd,' but not in a good way."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just came back from the movie theater and i love it, had is flaws, Jonathan Mayors was awesome as Kang and the new universe that was shown was great. not a big fan of modok but in the end i had a great time great post credit scene, 8/10 English review"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it! I thought it was a great balance of action and fun. So far my favourite of the more recent Marvel movies. 
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it. It's what you would expect, light hearted fun with good Marvel jokes. Characters are like able and finally Kang gets some screen time. Awesome movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really thought this movie was well done. It was engaging and kept me interested the entire time. I'm not sure why it only has a 45 from the ""pro critics."""
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went into this movie already enjoying the series so far. The critic is a bit jarring and honestly worried me about the film.

Boy, were they wrong. I had so much fun watching the third installment. The story of an older Cassie trying to keep up with her dad was really good and Jonathan Majors as Kang was a superb choice. It was written, directed and acted VERY well and a really good way to kick off Phase 5.

But that's just my opinion. Seriously, go check it out. Form your own opinion and I hope you like as much as I did."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed from the beginning.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eyy bro I'm writing a positive review because I like Jonathan Majors, he seems like a chill dude
And modok wasn't that bad chill out
But marvel is bad tho I'm not excited to see their movies anymore"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as people are saying. Definitely a ""move the plot along"" film for the MCU, but it has quips, some cool CGI, some bad CGI and Jonathan Majors knocks it out of the park."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm glad Kevin Feigie and Co. don't make movies for critics who aren't fans. Movie was fantastic. Kang is amazing and Paul Rudd is a ton of fun as always!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Is a great movie I don‚Äôt know why rotten tomatoes give them poor rate
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"They need to hire new writers, but other than that it was a fun and entertaining movie to watch."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great visual feast.  Some surprises, and enjoyed the creativity of the alternate universe.   very fun movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Because of the initial wave of less than favorable critic reviews I was a little hesitant about this movie. Ultimately Quantumania is an enjoyable sci-fi adventure film. I enjoyed the family dynamic, I thought the visualization of new worlds and creatures was playful and felt like a nod to Star Trek and Star Wars while still maintaining its own visual language. There are campy moments for sure, but that's kind of what I love about certain branches of sci-fi. I recommend seeing it in IMAX / 3D. Overall I disagree with some of the criticism saying it's not self contained. Yes, it sets up other stories for future installments but I think the story holds up on it's own and the movie ends up being an enjoyable action sci-fi adventure with a little family heart."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,A Great Marvel Movie to start Phase 5üêúüêúüêúüêú
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pollyanna and trite. Completely unbelievable. DC would have done it better‚Ä¶
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,solid. big head guy was weird.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another great Antman Movie, really enjoyed it."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Plot was rushed. Overall it was a mid-tier film.  Like Spdrmn FFH. If Disney has this much cold cash going into these movies I don‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt fix the little things like awkward dialogue, empty plot points, character development. Also Quantum realm was too dark to enjoy or experience it more, & where the hell was my man Luis?! If Disney capitalized on Fixing these minor things it easily could‚Äôve easily been close to a top-tier / avengers level film as we dive into phase 5. Although looking past those things movie was enjoyable, is Star Wars cannon in the multiverse now?! Also don‚Äôt sleep on Kang, he has so much potential. His intimidating stature alone and role as the main Antagonist saved the film. His cannon suit and malevolent nature really carried the climax of the film. I‚Äôm conclusion I‚Äôd give it 6.5/10 if I‚Äôm being generous."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I had to watch twice with my brother
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a super fun movie. It gave me Journey to the Center of the Earth vibes.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. Kang is cold!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,it was just bad. Sorry.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Computer Graphic Images.  Lots of Action. I loved that all 5 of them were involved in the Storyline and action.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,plot was odd but okay
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the villain and the Quantamaia.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So as we kick off phase 5, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the first film out and while it's not perfect I do think it is a fun ride for both fans of the character and the MCU as a whole, everyone in the film gives a great performance with the main stand-up being Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror, he's clearly having fun in the role and I look forward to seeing him future installments in the MCU. I will say there are a few things that are not quite as expected in the film especially with the ending and Modok is slightly disappointing. Other than that it is still a very well made film by Peyton Reed.

"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,a very fun adventure. does not deserve the hate it been getting.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very boring and not up to previous MCU movies.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics must not love fun and adventure. How Thor Love and Thunder passed muster and this did not is beyond me.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was pretty funny. 
Almost every scene with Michelle Pfeiffer was just awful.
Aside from that great movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was really good. Action, humor, pretty decent plot‚Ä¶.looking forward to the next stages of this storyline! Looking forward to Ant-Man and family in another movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another predictable boring Marvel flick and hopefully my last. I think I would rather sit though that 10 hour flick ""The Notebook"" than watch this again, and that is really saying something. At least that had a story, sappy as hell but still..."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was just a good movie he just kept marvel phase story going on
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Had a great night with this film. Characters reappearing from previous movies really made this a fun watch.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"it's a fun movie. I left happy. from a story point I think the ending should have been a tiny bit different, but that depends on if they wanted another sequel."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was everything you could want from a marvel movie - very well done and much better than all
Of phase 4- 4 stars instead of five because there is nothing new or original in the film as well as 90 percent of the film is actors acting with all green screen environments populated with far too many cg characters- that was getting  a bit annoying by the end of the film - however all cg was very well done and Johnathan Majors steals every scene he's in! He is amazing! The rest of the cast was very good 
as well paul rudd was paul rudd so you have to like him ! Michelle Phiefer looked amazing !"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the intensity throughout the movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"There was a lot happening in this movie, and the movie still completed a very good story. I really liked this movie, can't wait to see it again in approximately 45 days. It was also a nice setup for Loki."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film that had an engaging plot, excellent cast, and solid humor."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just didnt have that hype or feel that other marvel movies have, marvel becoming shit slowly"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I can see why some people could complain but I thoroughly enjoyed it and found Kang to be fascinating of course Love the actors and characters
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm not sure what the agenda is to create such negative press on this movie, but as a fan it's decent and helps setup things to come. In my opinion it's as good as the last several movies released. Don't listen to critics, go see it and have fun!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very chaotic and confusing to follow the story.  Transformed the creations of Kang and MODOK into unrecognizable and inconsistent characters of the Marvel Universe.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was great.  The visuals were stunning and this was just fun. A lot of phase 4 movies have felt like they were a drag but this clipped along and made me want more
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was the best Ant man so far and one of the best marvel movies since End Game. Visuals, story, acting were all amazing. There was plenty of great funny moments and packed with action."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Majors‚Äô take on Kang was the highlight of this one and needed more time to develop. The story had potential, but the tone was undercut by another round of misplaced humor. MODOK looked great in the full helmet. The big human head looked silly and should‚Äôve only been on screen a couple times at most. The worst part though, was the unnecessary redemption storyline that I think ruined the impact of the entire film. "
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"So called ""critics"" are idiots. This movie was good."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Another brilliant and hilarious movie that shows why critics should be irrelevant. I honestly don't understand why it seems like they choose random movies to pick on. This one was great! Critics: get a life!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Enough with the CGI already.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,We loved it. Paul Rudd is funny and charming as always.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Non-stop action and entertainment. Highly visual. Very good cast.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,O filme vale como um bom passatempo. O universo pr√≥prio do Homem Formiga √© expandido nesse longa e outros personagens s√£o melhor desenvolvidos. A trama serve pra abrir as portas do multiverso e entregar mais uma personagem para o pante√£o. O vil√£o √© aquele que dar√° as caras em muitos outros filmes do UCM. O filme garante uma divers√£o bem bacana.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pel√≠cula es buena, a mi gusto cumple, obviamente es una pel√≠cula de super h√©roes y esta de m√°s decir que no deber√≠a esperar tramas profundas y sombr√≠as, no es ese tipo de super h√©roe, es divertida tiene acci√≥n, los efectos si podr√≠an haber sido un poco mejores pero no siempre hay presupuesto ilimitado supongo, en conclusi√≥n disfruten la pel√≠cula es mucho mejor de lo que dice la cr√≠tica especializada, que en temas de series y pel√≠culas de marvel no siempre son muy confiables, mejor que varias pel√≠culas del MCU, no es la mejor de todas pero si esta muy buena."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!!! Love it!!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great setup for P5 üî•
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think it gets way more hate than it deserves. The name Quantumania implies that this movie is gonna be a spectacle, and thats exactly what it is. As much as it follows marvel's typical plot line fairly closely, it is also a lot different in many ways. Think if Multiverse of Madness was a fun, family focused, Ant-Man movie. The stakes were raised higher in this movie but they somehow seemed to keep the classic Ant-Man spirit. Definitely not top 5 marvel movies for sure, but it's got a lot of other ones beat for sure. Also 10/10 villain easily Jonathan Majors has been killing it recently in everything he does."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The special effects were great and the total concept of the movie was great. Looking forward to the next return to Quantumania or his  return to take over earth.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel started the new phase swinging with this one. Jonathan Majors is definitely an actor capable of putting his all into the mcu. Although it felt more like an avengers film than an antman, i thoroughly enjoyed all of it. Will be watching this in 3D to get the whole experience. A refreshing new pace after phase the lackluster phase 4. The pace was incredible and there was never a dull moment."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a great, fun movie! If you go in expecting a mediocre/bad movie at the level of Thor L&T or Dr Strange MoM, this one is so much better, you'll be very pleasantly surprised. And watch it in IMAX 3D if you're able to, it's definitely worth the higher ticket price!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Good pacing. Fun storyline. Characters were well developed and true to form. One of the better MCU movies of late.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"With great action, visuals and a thrilling performance my Jonathan Majors, AntMan 3 kicks off the next phase of the MCU in a long but spectacular way."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Beautiful visuals like all Marvel movies. A couple of performances were very lackluster, writing was subpar. If the consequences are so dire there shouldn't be mediocre comedy (at such strange points in the movie) mixed in. I was hoping for so much more to really kick this phase into another gear."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Regular Marvel movie with lots of action and good visuals and the acting was pretty good as well.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watched the movie in 3D. It was such a good movie and the 3D experience was amazing. I took my two kids with me. The seats weren't reclinable but other than that, we really enjoyed ourselves."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,good family entertainment. trys hard at the comedy jokes a little to much. but is enjoyable.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a fun bad movie.  I had a lot of fun watching it for the most part, but it wasn't a good movie.  The cgi for Moduk was so bad it was hard to watch anything with him in it.  Cassies's monologue to the Freedom Fighters was some cheesey writing. It reminded me of The Force Awakens meets Spy Kids.  I loved Jonathan Majors as Kang and Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet.  I didn't see the point of the Freedom Fighters.  It was a fun movie but it just isn't the same MCU it was 8-10 years ago ago.  Probably not one I'll be rewatching soon.  It did a good job of setting up what's to come. Unfortunately a movie needs to do more than that."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,9/10 good movie but it was cheesy because of Darell looks like Mr. Electric 
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This move was great! It had everything we needed from a great Marvel movie. If the ""critics"" keep this up, no one will care about their score at all. I think they are completely wrong on this one. This movie restored my faith in the MCU!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A lot of fun, and I do appreciate all the characters and world building for the Quantam realm "
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good overall movie. Nothing crazy ONG about it, but the critics are smoking something by calling it awful. Jonathan Majors is going to be amazing for the rest of these phases."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I think the critics are full of it I loved the movie from the beginning to the end!!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just watched Quantumania!

Easily the BEST Ant-Man movie to this date. Had a ton of really creative designs and some really good CGI. Kang was outstanding and Jonathan Majors' performance was very menacing. Great introduction to the new MCU villain. 8/10!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was incredible I had a blast throughout the whole thing. I was worried when I saw some bad reviews by critics but this was definitely one of my favorite MCU experiences ever. Jonathan Majors is amazing and Catherine newton SHINES in this movie. I love her and the whole quantum world building. Stories weave really well I just wish there was a bit more length to the fight scenes that's my only gripe. Overall an amazing movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best film since Endgame!!! Quantumania and No Way Home are the best since Endgame! I can't wait for what's in stock. Kang and Thanos are my favourite villains in Marvel Comics and now the MCU
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Best Ant-Man yet. Critics reviews are terrible. Also, Star Wars fans will love this one. No SW characters obviously, but you‚Äôll just have to see!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great, but the theatre turning on the house lights while the movie was playing was unfortunate and made the experience subpar."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Certainly the best Marvel installment since ""Spider Man: No Way Home"". We've been disappointed in most recent installments, but this one didn't disappoint. Instead, we were pleasantly impressed. Jonathan Majors is a standout, but the whole cast showed up. Totally recommend this one."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"AMATW:Quantumania is exactly what I expected. A blockbuster comic book movie. Plenty of action and humour with a fun ensemble of characters.

Some good character development from the previous movies."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was too long and I just didn‚Äôt like the humor.  I miss the good ole Marvel movies!!! I miss Iron Man and Captain American!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good plot, non-stop action, but not quite as humorous as the first two."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Much better MCU film than some of the recent ones. Kang is awesome!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,really tired of comic book movies
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very disappointed but not surprised. The movie makes no attempt to set out the rules of the quantum realm, specific characters abilities etc. when you start to ask yourself questions e.g why can they breathe in the quantum realm? Why does Kangs power blasts kill sometimes and not others? Why is there sand and water? Why are there humans who aren't humans? How did Casey make a portal to bring Scott and hope back with no explanation? So lazy, they need to do better."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I took the kids to see this and it was an amazing visual display. Their depiction of the Quantum Realm is an entirely new universe to explore. Its uniqueness seemed truly imaginative to me, and should be given credit. 

I'm not sure these reviewers are, or what they think movie fans want to see... Of course it isn't the BEST plotline, character arc, resolution etc in these 2 hours as it is part of a much bigger story - and I'm not sure critics appropriately review such films with that in mind. It's a 2nd sequel and a small part of a much bigger saga - and to still be so original in that context really is an achievement!

If you're comic or sci-fi fan, it's great. And Kang looks like he's going to be a lot of fun in the MCU."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute delight for the Marvel fans! A sneak peak for what's coming in the future! Just wish it was longer!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the critics this movie is fun and hugely entertaining!!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very good graphics and CGI, but mimicked Star Wars at the end"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,it was better than I expected it to be
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The Movie was good I just feel like they didn't take the time to brainstorm the movie and wrote it on set. I like the SFX, characters, Ect. It needs a better plot and less random bullshit to try to make the movie longer. Good movie though."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome! Beware the conqueror!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome. The theater was clean and beautiful. 5 stars except the surround sound. All the noise seemed to be coming from the front and not all around.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The characters are all top notch, the story was good, and the action was thrilling."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,is it the best of the marvel universe no. but the movie sets up the next Avengers movies and the rest of the phase. I think it is a lot better then people are giving it credit for.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very enjoyable movie.  Whatever these other idiots are saying about how it's all set-up for future movies is false.  Don't get me wrong - there's a LOT of set-up, but it blends well with the story, and makes for a great story.  I LOVED that they paid homage to the Micronauts without actually putting the Micronauts in the story (since Marvel no longer owns the property rights to them).  I recognized the attempt immediately, and very much enjoyed watching it play out.

Admittedly, there are better Marvel movies out there, but I always enjoy Ant-Man's character, and they kept a lot of the humor, though it was somewhat sacrificed for the apparent dangers in the rest of the movie.  Otherwise, this was just a lot of fun!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Beautiful graphics and great introduction to the chaos of Kang
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel meets Star Wars.. 
this had potential but went down hill quick. 
Felt like they took the modern Marvel characters and stuck them in a Star Wars planet from the Skywalker-Solo years. 

Kang could have had a bit more background. I think  as there was a bigger plot but he wasn't an easy to dislike bad guy."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film has a few issues but overall it's very entertaining and sets up the larger story in the MCU! I enjoyed this film and definitely recommend it to anyone who is on the fence about watching it. While it is a departure from previous ""Ant-Man"" films, it borrows elements from Star Wars and Avatar to portray an exciting exploration of a new world while also dealing with the threat of the multiverse!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of fun. Hank Pym is the GOAT, Majors is a MAJOR player."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it. Paul Rudd is amazing as always! Had me in laughs quite a bit but also had seriousness in it. This version of Kang is amazing and man can Jonathan Majors act. Love the tie ins to upcoming projects too.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lacked originality. Random scenes jumped from one place to another with missing plot just to move the story along.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good movie!! Can‚Äôt wait for what else is in store for phase 5
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"As usual, critics are out to lunch.... Quantumania was a fun ride... Khan was awesome and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing him again

Whole fam loved this movie"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very funny! Amazing visuals! Great performances from Rudd, Lily, Douglas, Pfeifer, Majors, & Newton! It felt like there were significant stakes in this film. Really enjoyed it!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, will definitely see again."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good overall movie and experience. Not too many bad things, as usual some idiots bringing their phones out but still enjoyed the movie, even with the movie going experience failures."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE," Good movie, action pack.."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is Kang's movie, and Kang is awesome."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It‚Äôs alright, not bad"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a different tone for an Ant-Man movie. The prior installments relied heavily on the heists and comedic elements. This is much more an action movie, using Scott and his family to battle a very complicated and formidable foe. This is a very good Marvel movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Would have been 5 stars if the humor was as good as the first two. You can tell Paul Rudd wasn't a writer in this one.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action, interesting plot and Paul Rudd. Great combination."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it...great movie..
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great popcorn movie.  Has the awesome visual effects,  epic villain, explosions,  etc. You care about the characters but a little formulaic at times. Also, i did not care for the language used at times."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was overall good. There were some stale moments, along with some stale acting (in my opinion) but I would recommend watching if you like Marvel or just want some laughs with good action."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"La actuaci√≥n de Jonathan Mayors impecable como Kang el conquistador. La pel√≠cula no es perfecta pero cumple con su cometido, que es mostrar a la nueva amenaza del universo marvel en el cine"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I GENUINELY THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS SO SILLY. I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND ID DEFINITELY WATCH IT AGAIN. FITS THE ANT MAN VIBE, SILLIEST MARVEL MOVIE"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Pretty entertaining and definitely worth a watch. Kinda of predictable though and a lot of language they could've done without.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best out of the 3! Loved every second of this film!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"8 years since the first movie and 5 years since the second movie Marvel Studios presents their 31st installment in their roster continuing the adventures of the hero who can shrink After the events of ‚ÄòAvengers: Endgame‚Äô Scott Lang aka Ant-Man is enjoying his fame and success and couldn‚Äôt be happier being with his girlfriend, Hope He‚Äôs written a successful book but his daughter Cassie now fully grown up played by Kathryn Newton is acting rebellious since they both lost so much time between his heroing and being snapped for 5 years Cassie wants to contribute to mankind and has even made her own suit being Stinger and created a device to contact the Quantum Realm She, Scott, Hope, Hank Pym, and Janet all get sucked into a sub-atomic universe beneath their own filled with intelligent organisms and the one in charge is a man named Kang played by Jonathan Majors He promises Scott to give him the time he lost with his daughter if he can get Kang what he wants but Janet warns him not to trust Kang, she‚Äôs been holding a secret ever since she was trapped in the Quantum Realm for 30 years It's my favorite one out of the three Some of the zippiness is absent but it doesn't skimp on the action and the best reason to see the movie is Jonathan Majors as the villain Kang, he is killing it being the next big threat having a calm demeanor but sounding menacing too Plus given the character‚Äôs abilities in the comics he can shape existence and time to his own making The music is much more intense and it's visually stimulating even scenes involving a probability storm almost matching ‚ÄòDoctor Strange‚Äô Love Kathryn Newton as older Cassie and it's crazy what they did with the MODOK character tying back to the first film Bill Murray makes a funny cameo too as Krylar They had more of the budget this time around and got creative with the designs of the world and the creatures Sad that Evangeline Lily is in less of this but I‚Äôm glad Michelle Pfeiffer has more to do than the previous film This officially starts phase 5 of the MCU with more of the multiverse involved Plus I'm anxious to see what happens later with more properties down the line ‚ÄòQuantumania‚Äô is the bigger movie of the three but I think more massive stuff is on the way "
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best marvel movie I‚Äôve seen in a long, long time! Fantastic movie! The critics don‚Äôt know sh*t. "
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too much expositions first and second act
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A birthday outing for my son and 3 of his friends (all 11). We all thoroughly enjoyed this one. I did not find a dragging moment in it myself. I actually found it to move along quite swiftly. Aside from a couple adult words sprinkled in, it was age appropriate for them. Highly recommend, and further solidifies the fact that critics obviously overthink things."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!! Love where Marvel is going!!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The Special effects  were awesome
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was funny and had a good story in my opinion. It knew when to do jokes and is a story a lot about Scott and his daughter. Kang was spectacular, we see a more serious Ant-man and sets up big things for marvel"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"MODOK was AWFUL! Overall the movie just completely fell flat of having any serious elements and it was a big let down. Majors as Kang was the highlight, but nothing else was notable. Very boring movie that added minimal to the MCU. Another flop."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Paul Rudd doing Paul Rudd things
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty much exactly what a Marvel-comics-based film should be like.  (If you don't like films based on comics, why are you going?)  Good acting all around, especially Pfeiffer and Majors, although Paul Rudd was fine.  Usual good use of humor, although I missed Luis and crew.  Liked MODOK and loved Cassie as future-Stature."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is 2 hours long, but feels like 3 hours. The first act of the film could‚Äôve been shorter, because the main plot of the film isn‚Äôt all that much convoluted. For a movie called ant man and the wasp, the wasp has little to do in the actual movie. One of the main stars being Kathryn falls short, for an actress who‚Äôs been in many projects it strongly feels as if this is her first time acting. The antagonist (kang) while being the highlight of the movie is very inconsistent. While this isn‚Äôt MCU at its worst, it definitely falls in the line of it does the job of being a comic book movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you're a Marvel comics and MCU fan, you will like how the story progresses from start to finish. Excited for the future as usual."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was too silly for the stakes, KtC was not enough of a threat to be the next ""big bad"".  Too many characters and too disjointed a story.  Only sawm it once and no plans to see it again, even on D+.  Loved Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfieffer; hated Katherine Newton.  Only went to see it as part of the ongoing Marvel story."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! Kang was a great villain.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I felt nothing watching this movie and I've been a die hard MCU fan since phase one, but this was the movie where I had to admit the magic really is gone. Pretty much the whole movie is shot against a green screen, there's very little in the way of interesting character development, it's just there to setup the next movie and the movie after that. The MCU had become a snake eating its own tail. Ever since the infinity saga ended and the quality started going down I've been holding out hope that they could get things back on track again but this movie felt like the point of no return."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Liked the cinematography. The first half of the film was weird, slow, and predictable. The second half was action-packed and interesting. Overall, though, the plot was predictable."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. The critics were completely wrong
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you're invested in the MCU after watching 15 years worth of films, then this will be another solid investment of 2.5 hours.

Pros:
- This movie is sort of tentpole to setting up future plot based on the end credits scenes.
- It sets up Cassie Lang as Stature, and a version of Kang (played very well by Jonathan Majors) so it's a good precursor to the upcoming Avengers flicks.
- The effects are worth seeing in a theatre.  

Cons: 
- The movie feels like a Star Wars film in certain places.  
- The setup of Kang feels like it could have been done with any hero in any storyline.  If you're looking for a solid grounded fun heist film like the previous two Ant Man movies, you're going to be disappointed.  A lot of what makes the Ant Man movies fun, was lost due to the plot and setup.
- The movie was destined to be a critical failure (see the RT score) due to the above two things, and the fact that you'd need to be following D+ shows and the previous two Ant Man movies to really appreciate what was done here.

Overall a good flick, but I can see where people are coming from with their gripes.  They just aren't my gripes."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun movie and amazing performance from Jonathan Majors as Kang the conqueror
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just as bland, paper thin, and forgettable as the previous two Ant Man films, proving that problem persists with Peyton Reed's directorial efforts in the MCU regardless of how much plot is thrown in. 

This film went too far into trying to set up the big Avengers film that it forgot to tell a quality singular story in its own regard. To that, the villain, Kang, doesn't really get the characterisation he needed, with the vague promise that we'll get a more compelling Kang down the road - but that doesn't make The Conqueror compelling in the present. 

Disappointing because Marvel Studios can do better than this."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,A truly stunning flick. Best antman yet. Awesome Characters. Hilarious had me laughing. My 7 year old loved it. Felt more like an amazing science fiction movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"First I was excited to see the movie. Seeing Kang and what he can do is awesome on the big screen. It seems Kang is going to be more of a villain in the upcoming releases than Thanos was. Jus remember, we have entered the Multiverse, and anything can happen. If you want a quick refresher, watch Loki Season 1."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely phenomenal! The story and visuals were great. I can't wait to see what Marvel does next.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. Jonathan Majors was awesome as Kang. He did an excitement job getting us to question whether he really is the bad guy in all this. There are occasions I felt sympathetic to him, then if course others where it was like OMG he's a lunatic lol. Everyone is bashing the CGI which I don't get. I thought the scenes that should look realistic did. Of course the quantum realm isn't going to look realistic. It's a fictional place with no basis in reality. Oh no that creature that doesn't exist in real life looks fake....wtf?! Lol"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very entertaining and my kind of weird! Action packed with amazing cinematography/ cgi effects. Right amount of humor. Arguably the best movie in recent years from marvel
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie won't break the top 10 best MCU movies, but still does a good job of being entertaining. As the start of Phase 5, it does a good job of telling a complete story while also setting up future events. If you enjoy Paul Rudd's style of comedy, you will enjoy this movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While not on my top 10 list of Marvel Movies, I found this movie to a be a fun start to Marvel's next phase. ...Good family entertainment!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Disney and Marvel have lost the talent to write a good story and their CGI is lacking. the only one that enjoyed it was my 7-year-old.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not the worst marvel movie but also not the best. Kang definitely made the movie
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,So I am normally excited to see Marvel movies. But this one was a big disappointment. It look like someone was trying to combine the Ant Man cast in a  Star Wars movie with a little wizard of Oz thrown in. If this is the future of Marvel with the Disney  network I think they are going to loose their fan base really soon.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was okay. I think marvel has lost their touch for making these movies great.  I felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie inside of a marvel movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. If you‚Äôre a Marvel fan you will enjoy the movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good movie. Lots of action and comedy.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Not too bad.  It was fun movie.  The whole family enjoyed it.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was pretty good. I don't see where all the negativity is coming from. Kang was also excellent.  An all around solid movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure why this got so much hate, but my kids and I enjoyed it from start to finish!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Do not listen to the critics, this movie is fantastic! Good story, visual effects, and score. I think the MCU is back on track with this one."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it.. The storyline with the multiverse and the strength of the women in this movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie in my opinion was ok. It's a bridge movie created to set up what coming next in the MCU. It's a needed addition to the line up that was enjoyably fun & functional. I do like serial connections these movies bring.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"There is some crazy stuff in it and it was enjoyable to watch. There are other MCU movies that are tougher to get through, but I this very much felt like a weird comic book issue put up on the screen.  I loved it."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"very good antman movie, excellent way to introduce kang and give closure and context of janet's life during her stay in the quantum realm"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,A little too corny but still good
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was lacking in so many areas. Weak storyline, not at all funny, editing seemed very jumbled. I was so looking forward to this movie but it was nowhere near as good as the first two."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie went from a comedy to a joke. Marvel let me down
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great humor, great characters. Beautifully crafted worlds. I did wonder why they didnt make themselves bigger early on but hey I had nothing better to do than watch."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,awesome! felt like I was in a surreal world!!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Probably the best Ant Man, came in thinking it was gonna be bad given how bad critic reviews were. Turned out to be a very fun and good time. Good setup for new MCU villain."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this was a fun experience. I think maybe they could have done more with Kang's origin, and a lot of things were a bit overdone, but I still believe that with suspension of disbelief you can enjoy this chapter in the MCU."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good action however, far over reliant on lackluster CGI and missing most of the humor and charm of its predecessors."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just watched it, the usual marvel movie vibes getting back. Not as great as infinity war/endgame but still a great movie by far after Endgame."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good Ant Man movie, though the pacing was very rushed, and wouldve benefited from more time. Marvel experts might be dissatisfied with the plot holes and some aspects of the villain"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sometimes critics are just dead wrong. Antman and the Wasp in Quantumania¬†is a blast. Plenty of excellent action sequences, lots of laugh out loud moments, and great performances, particularly from Jonathan Majors, who is proving to be an amazing villain. We loved it.

I think some film reviewers just have Marvel fatigue and they can no longer tell the triumphs (this film, Wakanda Forever) from the duds (Thor 4, Dr Strange 2)."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visually great movie, sets up the next phase of the MCU nicely."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was really fun, I enjoyed each minute. I had forgotten how Ant Man is and this brought it back. I am excited to see what comes next!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is not it. The first few scenes are the exact same, just said differently. The humor is childish. Also, like many Marvel movies, it was so predictable to a point where I knew exactly what was going to happen. The only good part was Jonathan Majors' acting."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Was it fun - yes. Therefore a win in my book.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to critics or take the rating to heart, the movie will live up to your expectations or possibly exceed them. Kang is just perfect, they nailed modok, and this is definitely a step up from some of the mediocre phase 4 projects."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! It had a bit of everything, it was great!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. I actually like it better than the first one honestly. The villain was awesome in this film. Very believable. There was a good balance of seriousness, comedy, and action."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Should have waited to see for free.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant Man meets GOTG meets Star Wars.  Solid start to Phase 5.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie was okay. Felt more like a sci-fi movie than a Marvel one‚Äîwhich was a positive for me. But some of the inconsistencies in that sci-fi had me more confused than entertained
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is a good movie. The plots were interesting. However, it was a little bit too long."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the movie. Really like Jonathan Majors in the role of Kang and Paul Rudd was great. Waiting to see what the next phase of the MCU holds.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Antman movie yet. loved it from beginning to end.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was ok. More for adult than family movie like we were expecting.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,I don't go to an Ant-Man film expecting a lot I go there to enjoy the humour and the characters because they are really funny comfort films. People were expecting too much from this film and that's why they are disappointed.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good continuation of the story, yet could be better. Sets the stage for part 5 at least."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Story is not what was expected. Characters feel inauthentic, you dont get a sense or feel for them. Characters feel shoehorned."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Basic movie. Nothing surprising or incredible 
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme med√≠ocre as crian√ßas ou pessoas sem crit√©rios v√£o gostar.
O que salva √© a atua√ß√£o do Kang.
O vil√£o esquece dos pr√≥prios poderes.
Precisa de ajuda de algu√©m que nunca viu a tecnologia enquanto o cara j√° vivia com ela...
Di√°logos fracos, filme sem peso, o cgi √© cansativo, n√£o tem profundidade no cgi e aquele aceno para o comunismo no meio do tempo.
MODOK sendo ridicularizado por uma crian√ßa."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great sci-fi movie with amazing visuals (minus modok).  I hope they return to the quantum realm in the future since there's so much more to explore.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was fun, exciting, thrilling, action packed and much more. It's everything you expect from a Marvel Movie. But the comedy and cringe moments really cut it for me. That's the only flaw most Marvel Films lack. The amount of cringe lines and moments is to much. But other than that the film was incredibly good and fun! I'll say give this a try, but you might come out disappointed with high expectations."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's your standard MCU film.  If you want to take a break and enjoy some fun spectacle for a few hours, this film will provide that.  If you are looking for a break in the Marvel formula, you will not find it here."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A fun time but it won't change your life.
Probably the most like a comic book superhero movie. It felt like it had jumped off the page. A weird world with no need to explain it's weirdness. The action was interesting, the movie looked good, I laughed at some of the jokes. The plot is nothing ground breaking but it doesn't need to be. Enjoyable, I would recommend watching it."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eu achei o filme muito bom, s√≥ que o povo colica muitas expectativas, fica achando que os filmes v√£o ser igual Vingadores: Ultimato, mas n√£o √© bem assim. Claro, h√° filmes que realmente n√£o s√£o muito bons, por√©m, o terceiro filme do Homem-Formiga n√£o √© um deles. Amei o filme, abrange muito o Reino Qu√¢ntico, o CGI √© bom e o roteiro tamb√©m."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Seems so many ""critics"" have something personal to prove against the MCU. Thankfully they are wrong! A fun movie that shows where the MCU is headed. Standout performance by Majors as Kang."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was very funny and enjoyable. Ant man is his usual self and Kang stole the show. The new Cassie actor was a bit annoying in the beginning but was okay by the end.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too many fighting scenes, in my opinion. I did enjoy the ending with the giant ants, but I hated how they took too long that it makes the audience forget about them."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"great visuals Kang is a good bad guy, no slow parts. Overall very good but missed some of the magic of other Marvel movies. excited to see how it ties everything together."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun time overall. Villain is awesome and they really showed how daunting he can be.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,good movie bad audience the truth is not everything will be each movie put another character understand they are telling the story of just one it is not that another avengers will appear.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a great return to form for Marvel. We finally feel like we are seeing where the next phase is going to take us.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the characters and the action. It was fun but pretty far fetched
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This exceeded my expectations. I knew with the cast of this movie that the light hearted nature of the previous installments had little to no place here. Colorful creative creatures, a plethora of heroines and heroes, and a brilliantly played villain left me wanting more. Good job on this one."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great fun ride ! Lots of action and never a dull moment. Incredible visual effects. Don't understand why the critics don't like it.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So much wasted potential. I was really looking forward to this, also for Kang. And it's very mixed. The Rick and Morty-isms here just didn't work for me and felt jarring in the MCU, but that style of humor generally works for me with the show. I barely laughed. I did think Majors and Pfeiffer were awesome and definitely standouts here. By the end, it just felt like random things were happening and everything felt very messy."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was not the best but was a fun movie, the mix of Ant and Kang was good, i enjoying a lot, cant wait for more Kang and the multiverse"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, this movie was very refreshing in comparison to the latest MCU movies. Gives me a glimmer of hope that the best MCU days aren't entirely behind us."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Movie Ever. Like Spiderman, Batman, all of them in one packed action after action movie.."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Johnathan Majors was a revelation.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Need to explore more on story, slow, graphics awesome."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun and exciting story that sometimes tries to lean too much into the jokes. Overall a very fun time. I am excited to see where the MCU goes from here!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the best Antman yet. The official introduction to Kang was awesome. Can't wait to see how the rest of the story unfolds!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Definitely the best of the 3 Antman movies, but could have done better introducing us to Kang. The story seems silly at times. We spend a lot of time in the Quantumrealm but barely learn what it even is. Definitely could have used more time for VFX artists and an overreliance on the Volume screen technology."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,SO GOOD! We saw this movie in 4D and it was awesome. Can't say Ant-Man is my favorite marvel character but this movie was so good!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"very derivative, like the writers watched star wars the night before they came up with this slapped- together, tired story. it was fun but it won't stay with me very long. yawn."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best of the three Ant-Man movies. Cant wait to see what they get into next !
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,bad film. worst MCU film ever!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Marvel movies so far!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Continues character development and sets up future stories.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Yet another one where the critics are looking for Oscar performances. It's definitely not that but still a fun ride.  I enjoyed it and recommend it to Marvel fans.  Way better than Thor Love and Thunder which is the worst Marvel movie ever imho.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was looking forward to the visuals of the Quantum Realm, which were impressive in and of themselves. But tying together such a strong villain and the dynamics of the family relationships along with new characters in the realm, this movie is brilliant in so many ways. Tons of fun, heart, and humor.

Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror is amazing. A truly frightening villain. The amount of inventiveness in his movie is astounding, it could have easily been a mess. In fact, the probabilities for messiness were quite high. 

To pull it together with such smooth writing and light-hearted fun is genius. When a story can be light, fun, yet dark and deep, you tend to have some powerful story potential. Anyone who doesn't like this movie has buried their inner child and wouldn't know 'fun' if they paid a movie ticket to experience it."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good story, actors and animation. Lots of plot twists. Helps to understand if you have seen the other movies"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Very fast moving and full of strange things and situations. Some situations seemed too unrealistic/cartoonish for my taste. If you like sci-fi you MAY like it.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Never to late to not be a ‚Ä¶. This movie is a must see in IMAX 3D! Lot of action deep in the under under world , Look out for the Little Guy!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Es una pel√≠cula con un entorno gal√°ctico, en el que se enfocan m√°s en kang que en el personaje principal el cu√°l es ant-man, una forma de introducir a kang en el ucm aunque bajaron el nivel de modok a lo que era un gran villano en los c√≥mics y series animadas igualmente a kang pero menos mal es una variante no tan poderosa, la verdad solo esperaba lo que la pel√≠cula mostraba nose porque muchos fans esperaban que salieran muchas cosas y qued√© m√°s agusto con las escenas post creditos el cu√°l me completa la pel√≠cula y no se me hace tan mala"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was fun and the humor wasn't too overdone and forced like the recent Thor movie. There weren't any annoying pandering scenes that felt out of place and the action and drama had a great balance. Most of the movie felt like it was filmed with a computer generated background, but the visuals were still very well made. It's a good ""watch once"" kinda movie at the very least and I don't understand why the critics are dog-piling on it. I am picky about Marvel movies and no longer feel urgency to watch all of them but I'm glad I saw this one."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Absolutely fun movie!  GreaT visuals and special effects. The story was solid and the characters were engaging. Definitely a fun time at the movies. Also stay for two important after credits scenes
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid movie. Definitely better than the second ant man. I‚Äôm excited for what the future holds with Kang and the avengers.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you've seen Loki and What If?, then this makes much more sense. üòÖ

Visually, it is fantastic. They have a lot of fun creating a surreal world. 

Family dynamics including secrets, generational gaps, and expectations/disappointments are played out. Much of which get resolved to some degree in a satisfying way. 

MODOK and his language/dialogue is less than preferable for children. It was more of an eye roll for me. 

Thematically, caring for others and self-sacrifice are highlights. 

By the end of the movie, the stage is set for the rest of the conflict for this phase of the MCU. So, it feels necessary as a plot point."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had a really fun time watching this movie.  I could really see Cassie being Scott's daughter in reap life, they had great chemistry.  I thought the cgi was pretty good.  Loved the whole quantum realm worlds, or different parts of it.  Were there a few misses, yes, especially since they never seemed to run out of pynn particles discs.  I thought they did a good job explaining how time runs differently is different parts of the realm.  Erases the so called plot hole from the first Ant-Man movie and how Scott didn't lose 5 years during Endgame.  Had a blast, a 9 out of 10 for this DC and Marvel fan!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,My grandson and I thought it was a fun movie with great special effects and I love  Paul Rudd!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This totally gave me Sharkboy and Lavagirl vibes‚Ä¶ lol. It‚Äôs a wacky, fun Sci-Fi film! Liked it even more the 2nd time. "
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,the movie is perfect the only problems are the ending and the mood aside from that is perfect
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It felt like a genuine marvel movie, more so than thor L&T, and made watching the disney plus shows worth it to see the connections. There was a good amount of humor and references, and although the beginning felt a bit forced, it was still a fun watch that felt like we were getting back to the roots."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Really decent dirty line with excellent tie-in to Disney/ marvel series- no spoilers
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It‚Äôs entertaining but you will need or want more backstory to make it make sense.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,A great way to introduce Kang & felt heavier than previous Antman movies.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great popcorn movie. Explored the Quantum Realm and now all MCU fans can expect mayhem when Kang Dynasty opens up. The only downside ... where was Luiz????
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a good time. The only thing missing was Scott's prison buds.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched the movie Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And I can say that this movie is more about space adventures than the long-awaited Avatar 2. There were also Star Wars, Stargate, and John Carter. This time we will find out what it feels like when you travel into another universe. I can't say that this movie is full of original ideas, but it has the atmosphere of space adventure. Therefore, one should not expect an adult, abstruse plot from the movie. On the contrary, watch this as a child who is open to everything new."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Very fun visual effects and really liked Jonathan Majors' performance.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,very overrated bill Murray's did not bring anything to the story at all the ending credits and post credits are the only thing i liked about the movie
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"sweet movie, critics can suck it"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid Marvel Movie. You wont be disappointed
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked everything about the movie from the acting to the story to the special effects. An Ant-Man movie at its finest
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't care what the critics say. This film was an AMAZING start to Phase 5! It's AMAZING how they had Ant-Man and his whole family team up! This is an excellent segway to ""Avengers: The Kang Dynasty""! It definitely should get a nod for Best Visual Effects in 2024! The best part of this linking to the Multiverse Saga is that there are multiple variants of one character! If you want to know who is the variant being multiplied then go see it!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the whole cast. Jonathan Majors is great.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoy the movie. I like the other 2 and I think this one is more Dinamic, from beginning to end. It's  different since there's way more characters and things you can pay attention to.

Special effects were ok, may be an issue for someone more picky.
Acting was good to great..feel like there less fun stuff but still there and I like that in the Ant-man franchise.  

I will see it again in theaters for sure,"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I freaking loved it. just enough comedy and drama. I can't wait to see how cut throat Kang will be!!! Jonathan Majors is an amazing actor!!!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought I was entertaining.  I thought the run time was just right.  I loved the cast, especially Jonathan Majors as Kang.  I really don't understand professional ""critics"" rating this poorly.  It seems like a movie that was complete, all to itself. It didn't seem like it was just setting up something else for the MCU.  

I'd highly recommend this to anyone.  It almost stands alone without the need for the extended universe."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the ""critics"".  Most of them are clinging onto what's left of a once honorable profession. With the advancement of technology, anyone can be a ""critic"". It was an entertaining movie. If your reason to go to a movie is to feel something in your life, go volunteer at a homeless shelter or join the military. Go to the movies for escapism. Go for entertainment. Especially a comic book movie. Good lord...i don't understand how these hacks can write something negative about a funny and entertaining movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Way too much good stuff in this movie for there to be such negativity. Solid entry into the franchise.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie wasn't perfect, but it was a cool way to introduce Kang. I loved the first real glimpse into the Quantum realm, I hope that we get more show/movies exploring that universe. Action was Kool, Kang was a bit watered down, but the movie as a whole was fun, I enjoyed the ride."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining, fun and a good start to this new phase."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie had so much potential in its trailer but in live action that same father daughter cringe relationship.kang disappointed too.and the story line was bad.there was no peak action scene.this movie is BAD.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining and visually impressive.  Funny and touching in places.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed it! Loved Cassie and Kang, great additions. Kang clearly will be a problem for a long time, and I'm there for it."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Scott Lang, Hope Van Dyne, Hope's parents Janet and Hank, and Scott's daughter, Cassie, get stuck in the quantum realm and need to find a way out. Paul Rudd, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Jonathan Majors' excelled in their roles and were the highlights of the film. Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang really brought the character to life, but I felt how the character was written, was underwhelming for him to be the next big villain of the MCU. After leaving the cinema, I felt like this film didn't make any progress in the MCU; Ant-Man got through it without having a character arc, and I'm not fearing Kang like I did other villains of the MCU. I hope over time, the decisions of this film play out, and maybe this movie will get better as it ages.

""Expected more from this film"""
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring. Flawed plot.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm genuinely amazed by how dim-witted the critics are for this film. No, I don't think it was amazing. It wasn't groundbreaking cinema. It was enjoyable though. Action, some decent acting, mostly from Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer, and Paul Rudd was great as always. Visually, I liked it. Marvel has received plenty of slack about their VFX work, but there honestly were no issues here. The wide shots were very pretty, and the Quantum Realm itself had lots of unique characters/beings that for sure required a ton of VFX work. The only noticeable ""VFX"" issue was when there were close ups of characters talking, you could tell there was a green screen behind them. But you can't expect Marvel to be shooting inside an actual quantum realm, right? Right??? Story-wise, it was bland, the group gets trapped in the Quantum Realm (as we see in the trailer), and they have to find their way out. They encounter Kang the Conquerer, and the movie follows along that path. I had three genuine issues with the movie as a whole. SPOILERS - 1: The way that King in this movie was finished off felt anti-climactic. 2: Kathryn Newton as Cassie just didn't do much for me. She felt stiff as a character and while I don't think her chemistry with Rudd was terrible, it just didn't feel intimate. I'm not saying the Endgame actress or the child actor who's grown up from the first two Ant-man movies would've been better, but Newton didn't do well in this one. Hopefully she's better in the future. 3: The cuts to different scenes felt so weird. They would plug in a different scene into what felt like one scene split into two randomly, and would cut at what I felt like were the wrong times. 
All in all, I liked it. It was enjoyable. Definitely more intense than the previous installments of Ant-Man films and didn't include as much humor. (Thankfully, because as much as I found the first and second Ant-Man films amusing because of the comedy, I was worried they would fuck it up like Taika did for Thor L&T). Not sure why Rotten Tomato critics rated it as the second to worst Marvel film, but it's definitely the middle of the pack -ish in the collection of Marvel Cinematic projects. Some critics stated it felt more like it was setting up future projects over making its own story, but I disagree. It did feel like its own story, but because the audience knows beforehand that there's more coming with Kang, it makes it feel more like a setup movie. For me, I didn't get that feeling until the end as well as the mid/post-credit scenes"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,The acting and script is corny. Jonathan majors acting was great but his character (kang) was very underwhelming.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I made a profile just to share how disappointed I was in this MCU movie outing. Don't get me wrong Michele Pfifer and Jonathan Majors put forward world class performances. However, I don't think I've ever been so apathetic to a MCU universe outing as much as this one. This movie missed the mark on so many levels. The hope that the big bad would succeed and burn it all down made waiting for the finale less fatiguing."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie - very entertaining and way better than any Phase 4 movie
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a fun escape for 2 hours.  Great cast!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and The Wasp is a great leap into starting off the Marvel multiverse. The movie was funny, heart warming, and really unexpected. Unexpected that Ant-Man& The Wasp could make a world that feel like being in space like in Guardian of the Galaxy. This is a weird movie that you will have fun watching."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best marvel movie since the last Spiderman. Lots of Star Wars vibes but it was still good.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good visuals and action scenes
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie awesome experience. The pace was good blended with action and comedic elements. The only thing didn‚Äôt like was the way they portrayed MODOK. But that can be overlooked for the other characters in this particular type of movie. Overall I still enjoyed and loved this movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It‚Äôs was very good movie!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,More wasted potential. Marvel does not know how to balance humor and seriousness.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was pretty good especially in 3D
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,People can't seem to enjoy anything these days. I thought the movie was going to be disappointing based on the countless bad reviews i've seen from people on social media but it was actually really good. It was accurate to the comics and the visuals were beautifully presented in the film. Don't listen to the reviews until you actually watch the film yourself. I love quantumania ! Definitely gonna have to rewatch it on shrooms or something. It's a trip.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"just average, marvel needs to do better. Writing not that great."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was an ok movie- not great. I guess I‚Äôm in the minority because I didn‚Äôt really find Jonathan Taylor as Kang that believable as a villian. It felt like it needed a better script and CGI, but it was an afternoon with some popcorn, a way to pass the time and a movie easily forgotten when it‚Äôs over. "
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Meh, nothing terrible but nothing special."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action. Amazing visuals
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining throughout the movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I knew Kang was gonna be a badass, but Jonathan Majors made the character so much more intimidating.  Was really nice to Corey Stoll to come back one last time. And that final battle, just WOW. Will definitely be seeing this at least two more times. Great popcorn flick!"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I LOVED IT!!!!! I don't know what people are talking about this was a great movie and Kang is AWESOME!!!!!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,not the best the mcu has to offer but it was fun entertaining and a good way to kill 2 hours. had a blast. definitely see it in 3D or 4DX or at an Alamo Draft Drafthouse if any of these options are near you üíØ
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I really thought it had the right amount of action and funny parts. I liked it as a good filler film. The timing was right on with the joke and The Kang actor is so good he really is great!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end did not get bored at all. Minor complaints were probably the end credit scenes.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,best ant-man movie yet
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,An awesome Marvel movie. Great set up and tie in for future movies. My whole family enjoyed it.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Decent but nothing special. Convoluted story. Great visuals. Typical new wave Marvel movie.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome!!!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it was an okay movie.. ridiculous premise, but it's a Marvel movie it's not like you're going there to see Shakespeare. lots of action.. expected more humor."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good. Very cool and colorful scenes. Love the marvel universe movies. Kind of far fetched but it is s comic book movie and I love Paul Rudd and Antman. Be sure to stay tuned for extra parts at the end.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too many attempts at comedy. I wanted to leave the theater within 30 minutes.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,A must see if you follow Disney + wait for both teasers
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel has lost its essence unfortunately....
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was very science fiction-y.  I like Ant-Mans sense of humor but it seemed more serious throughout the movie.  It was ok.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It wasn't good at all, there's no twists or anything just straight forward."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was bad. I would have given it a far worse score if it wasnt for Jonathan Majors. Not sure why the quality of these movies are ao bad. Its neen down hill since Doctor Strange 1.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall, Quantumania is a pretty good and worthy addition to the rapidly expanding MCU franchise. Like its predecessors, it's epic and funny, yet unique and unlike any other Marvel movie that's out there. Although this latest installment to the MCU may leave much to be desired, it proves that it's definitely not the worst in its collection - nor is it the best."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a little different from other Ant-Man movies, but it was a great mix of comedy and high- stakes action."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Passable, but ultimately forgettable. It's the worst Antman film yet, with the 2 titular characters being sidelined by the granny and the daughter characters. I'm not sure Wasp even has much of any speaking lines at all.

Also the others were right: this has a very Star Wars lite setting."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"good action, comedy . a little cheesey but fun overall."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Definitely the weakest of the three movies. Felt like the writers just watched Star Wars and Rick & Morty and then smashed together several elements/storylines. 
Cassie's character definitely didn't age well. She's rather whiny and exactly what you'd think the stereotypical teen from San Francisco would be like. 
One of the characters also explicitly plugged socialism. So Disney, of course, had to get that messaging in. Not especially worth paying to go see."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Go in open-minded! I did and I enjoyed it, you can't believe the online critics! Go watch and see for yourself, a mix of fun and Jonathan Majors was fantastic, KANG is not dead I believe he'll be back very very soon  ü§û hopefully!! The CGI was damn near perfect, but like I said it's a start of a new phase just enjoy it, it'll all connect soon."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"there have been two hour movies before but, I always noticed I was getting tired or thought the movie should have wrapped it up by 1/2 or 3/4 way. But this one there was no notice of the time, a lot of action, a little humor, some emotion, etc. Well done."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Me and my son enjoyed it
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel has jumped the shark!
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Way too much focus on special effects and lack of any real story.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"SPOILER REVIEW It was a solid movie, nothing special to put it above average though. Overall the story was pretty slow and conveluded but the action made up for the slowish story. Lots of unescesary new charecters were added and without a doubt it woudlve been better without the ""rebel"" group. Little sidenote, a lot of the plot reminded me of the star wars movie ""Rogue One"". Anyways, Kang was a standout, and jonathan majors nailed the role. My only complaint with Kang being he lost to ants. Paul rudd was charming and funny as usual, and antman/scott had some nice moments, but overall very little character development. Hope/the wasp was basically a background charecter. Same with Janet, and except for her narrative exposition about kangs background she had no purpose in this movie. Hank was fun and had some creativity and proved his genius again, but wasnt large factor in the movie."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Okay, so it ain't Wakanda Forever but it's WAY better than Love and Thunder. Just lower your expectations and turn your mind off at the door. This movie is 100% pure comic book. Weakly written? Sure. CGI overload? At times. Big, crazy superhero fun set in a brand new world with a compelling new villain? That about sums it up. Don't overthink it. Just enjoy."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"LOVED IT!! First of all, this film is a BIG, Sprawling Sy-Fi Movie. It really helps knowing this going into it. Secondly, it offers up lots of different worlds, so yeah, you do see a Star Wars slant in it. It threw some critics.

At its heart, it's still an Ant-Man movie but on an epic scale. I loved the Story, the Characters, it's Action and of course, the Humor. It's a FUN, EXCITING Time for ALL!!!!!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,I wish they would've showed us why and how other Kanes were Abel to catch him beat him and send him to the quantum realm we no his ship was sabotage witch kane lol and then they sent him to the quantum realm with a broken ship that could've been like a extra 45 minutes showing us that The movie was not long enough I wanted more. I wanted a backstory about kane
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it a lot because of the story telling the action and the set up going forward. Definitely a must see
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,The story line was all over the place. Michelle Pfeiffer was terrible.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film just felt like a jumbled mess.  Kathryn Newton had some of the worst dialogue in the entire MCU and M.O.D.O.K was absolutely laughable both as a character and his visual appearance.  Everything about this film is just bottom of the barrel MCU and is so disappointing.  I was soooo excited for Quantumania it was unreal.  I expected the first movie of Phase 5 to be at least better than Ant-Man and the Wasp, but little did I know that it would be in the bottom 5 MCU films.  While I don't necessarily agree with the people saying this is the absolute worst MCU movie, it's damn near close.  I think it's slightly better than Eternals and Captain Marvel, but that's about it.  Iron Man 2 was a movie that as a kid I thought was cool, but as I got older and the more I watched it I slowly started to realize that it wasn't a good movie.  To this day I'm an avid Iron Man 2 hater, yet I think it's still better than Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.  I genuinely can't believe how disappointed I am with this movie and my faith in the MCU is close to nothing."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved what we got from Johnathan Majors as Kang, and as soon as it was over I wanted more from him. While I understand people's opinions on modok, I enjoyed what they did and thought it was funny. Loved Paul Rudd as always..visual with the quantum realm were really well done. Overall I enjoyed it!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It hits the entertainment function and builds the world like any fantasy movie should in a way that ups anticipation for whats to come. Its stupid when it intends to be stupid, and you feel it when youre supposed to. Im happy to see this era of proper self awareness from marvel"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Marvel is falling off.but at least this was better than Thor Love and Thunder.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good Marvel movies üé•
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"When I first saw the rating for this movie I was shocked and thought it couldn't be true, but now I understand. It does truly hurt me to give this movie 3 stars, especially with the fact that this was my 4th most anticipated movie for 2023. There is so many things about this movie that are amazing but so many other things that are terrible. Let's start with the positives. Obviously Kang was a positive, Jonathan Majors giving one of the best performances that I have seen in the entire MCU. The character backstory and development were beautifully played out. Visuals, this was a big factor for this movie, and honestly I think they were pretty good, especially after conflict for Phase 4 and the conflict of VFX artist at Marvel, only 2 or 3 scenes that I was like, that doesn't look good and the first Act was had very questionable visuals but still overall pretty good. Costume design was excellent. Hank Pym, had excellent character moments, moments I've been waiting to see ever since the first Ant-Man (As well as many other characters). Post Credit Scenes were fantastic. M.O.D.O.K.'s design, I thought was cool, yes the face looks so creepy but that is the point of M.O.D.O.K. and that armor was awesome.

Now onto the negatives. M.O.D.O.K.'s character ark and personality was terrible, I felt like it was poorly dealt with, honestly I just couldn't stand it. The overall dialogue felt sloppy in many areas, jokes never landed well, lines were given poorly or timed badly. The overall editing and structure of the film felt off at times, particularly Act 1, too rushed and clunky. Honestly this film was too short, more time was needed, and more focus to the dialogue and structure. Bill Murray's character was only an excuse to get Marvel another big time famous actor in the MCU. Themes of this movie were very unbalanced and forgotten, there was no extreme emotional points, nothing so thrilling or heart stopping. This movie didn't feel like an Ant-Man movie at all, just a movie used to build up for Kang Dynasty. Overall, This film is very conflicting, great and terrible moments, only recommend if you are a superhero fan."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent visuals. End credit trailers are a must see
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It is amazing I love kong
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was funny and exciting. Kang was an amazing villain but needed to be exploited more and modok was very disappointing. Overall the movie was fun to watch and kang will be a great villain for the mcu.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was good. Nothing over the top but it did have a hint of Endgame to it...
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The pronoun game was annoying. Although the rest of the movie was hilarious. One of the funniest superhero movies.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought it was good. Not as good as the first Ant-Man. But definitely way better than the last MCU movie I saw (Thor: Love and Thunder.) I stayed awake during the whole thing. Did seem to drag a bit at times, but I think that it was necessary for Kang character development. Looking forward to seeing more of this villain. I liked M.O.D.O.K. Although think he should have been less of a throwaway character for MCU. I liked all the secondary characters introduced in the movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors shows how Kang will be larger than Thanos. The Lang family fractures and grows in this film which is all about showing how you can care for family and others.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing set up for Kang the Conqueror! I‚Äôm even more excited for this MCU phase with the inclusion of the multiverse!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action and plot.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this film!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The tone was different than the first two films, but it was a great introduction to Kang. As someone who isnt a fan of the silly humor, I liked this."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Took away the best things of the previous films and became a little formulaic.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This is definitely a different type of Ant-man movie not like the first two. But still a great film that it‚Äôs setting up the future of the MCU.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. Kang is going to be a PROBLEM
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is easily the best Ant-Man movie, while the effects aren't the amazing thing ever, people like Kang and Scott easily carry this movie. But people like M.O.D.A.K. and Cassie kind of ruin this movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun movie. Great characters, great humor, and great CGI. If you have high expectations and feel as though every movie needs to be the caliber of The Godfather, then this isn't the movie for you. Have some popcorn and enjoy."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great! Paul Rudd never disappoints! Funny, greatly animated, good start to the phase!  watch loki series to fully grasp what's going on! Awesome!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solu√ß√£o f√°cil, mas me diverti muito."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Majors did a superb job. Rudd delivered as usual. It was a little weird and started a little slow. Didn't quite hit the mark with it's cohesiveness.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie better than Wakanda forever
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was the worst movie ever. It's not even that the plot points are bad, serious moments are ruined with silly jokes. This could've been a good movie, it just wasn't. The main characters never got hurt or suffered serious consequences up until the end. Even when they did, they went home fine."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Finnaly an Amazing Marvel movie again
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a fun movie and Kang is ‚Ä¶.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Bravo Kevin F and MCU, a well done addition to the Ant Man and the Wasp saga.  Very unexpected that me and my 12 year old did a dozen claps and high fives during the film. Thanks and anyone reading the garbage established media reviews, if youre an MCU fan, this doesnt disappoint!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,NOT A GOOD STORYLINE.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely my second favorite MCU movie since endgame. My 4 store rating is not in the sense of where it lands against all movies but in respects to movies in the MCU. This movie falls in the top half of all marvel movie in the MCU for me. Probably at number 12. Kang was fantastic. The rest of the cast was solid. The comedy wasn't over the top and a landed every time.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than expected. Don't let the reviews distract you. Watch it first then judge. Kang is the next big villain.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Critics are wrong, but not by much."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Another movie where Mar been had lost its way. More plot and Kang was underwhelming
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Definitely worth seeing. The action is was all there. Comedy was down played a little but still had my family laughing. The Star Wars vibe is familiar. I will bring my kids again.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It‚Äôs good but has a few flaws. The push to have credits roll under 2 hours is hampering the story. Kang needs more explanation of his exile and the what, how and where of his powers (cuz there is none). Janet‚Äôs time in the quantum realm needed more fleshing out. There‚Äôs one major piece to the final battle that needed an explanation but it was glossed over for all of about 5 seconds and made 0 sense. Overall however extremely weird, fun and enjoyable. "
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal, exciting, action packed, great special affects blew my mind"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a fantastic movie start to finish. Had enough information with the right amount of action and good bit of funny like Antman is supposed to have. Well done marvel! Very excited for the future!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie. Kang the Conqueror was a nuanced and powerful villain. The father/teenager dynamic felt pretty believable.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Amazing! Best Ant Man film yet!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Don‚Äôt believe the critics this movie was amazing!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While not one of the best marvel films, it still is a lot of fun. It is definitely an Ant-Man film. Kang is also a great villain."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. just all the monaloging
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantum Star Wars! A rebellion, a dark lord, a small band of heroes, alien cantina, Greedo, TIE fighters, and multi-legged Ewoks!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great addition to MCU! Although it had cheesy dialogue at times it kept the light hearted humor the Ant Man movies are known for (especially with Paul Rudd) and added a more serious tone in terms in gravity of Kang and his heavy role in the on going multiverse story line of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Speaking of Kang, Johnathan Majors knocked it out of the park with performance as villain with weight, purpose and not coming off as flat. Will see it again!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant Movie! Kang is brilliant his character is menacing! There is a storm coming!

Honestly screw what the haters are saying! The storyline, the beautiful scenery and the character arcs I love them all this movie has so much amazing and pretty sights! Yeah MODOK was a bit wierd to look at, at first but even he makes sense he is just a big head, Cassie's the future of Marvel! John majors Kang is powerful and scary he will be taking out some players! So please enjoy this movie and be open minded!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Marvel studios does it again. Tight 2 hour movie that flies by. Well cast. Kang is one bad MF.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was really great. Was fast passing and the suspense leading up to Kang was great. VFX was amazing, way better than phase 4 could do. Cant wait for more antman!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm convinced more and more that movies are generally not the problem, the critics are. There's just no pleasing some people, and people who enjoy movies tend to not post reviews. That being said ant-man isn't an Oscar award winning movie but it's fun, the effects are good, it introduces Kang  beautifully, it balanced an otherwise silly tone (much better than love and thunder) with just the right amount of seriousness."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Overall, a lackluster attempt at creating new threats in the MCU. Jonathan Majors is a sleeping volcano and should serve as a formidable foe in the future. But, he was let down by a story that failed to outline his purpose and abilities. Hopefully, there is more background. Otherwise, the world building felt second rate. Many of the characters were Jar Jar level of ingratiating (‚ÄúHow many holes do you have‚Äù). Anyway, the set-up for a reconciliation between Scott and Kassie was admirable, but incomplete. Evangeline Lilly was wasted. The middle portion when Kang sends Scott on a mission was mesmerizing and I wish there was more MCU ‚Äúscience‚Äù involved. Not a total waste, but definitely a weak entry into the MCU."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was funny and had alot of action
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang played by johnathan majors was interesting. interesting villian. i look forward to seeing johnathan majors in creed 3. This movie was good but it was alot of green screen and I liked the cameo by bill murray. The special effects were good but the after credit scenes were not that good. I prefer the other 2 ant man films. This film tried to be too much like star wars. Good special effects though id give this a positive review. worth a trip to the theaters if your a marvel film or for the special effects.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think some people's expectations are too high, or they just don't like comic book movies. I was thoroughly entertained. This movie hits the important things: it develops the characters and they have all grown by the end of the movie, it is consistent with the MCU overall and makes the way for further new developments, the story is interesting and exciting, and it is fun! Michelle Pfeifer is brilliant as Janet Van Dyne, definitely bringing out a woman you can see to have been leader of the Avengers for several years (in the comics). The special effects are fantastic! I enjoyed this and look forward to seeing it again!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I had my concerns going in and I definitely like the first 2 movies more. But I really enjoyed it. It has good action and what I thought were real stakes. It still has that humor that you expect from Antman while still giving Kang a serious tone.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Critics  bashing 3rd Ant-man movie to ridiculous. Wasn‚Äôt as good as first 2 movies, but was good enough to recommend it. Actually felt like more about Hope‚Äôs mom story."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Marvel has definitely struggled with phase 4. This film wasn't terrible but phase 5 is off to a rocky start. After seeing this film I can imagine it being reworked into a good movie but I'm mostly confused as to how their latest films have everything they need to work but they keep missing the mark.

The story is simple yet they fill it with so much nonsense that about halfway through you just find yourself not very invested in what's going on. They tried to build up Kang but in doing so it felt like they introduced him far too late in the film. Over an hour into the movie it still felt like it was beginning.  They introduced a new world and new characters but we didn't get to know any of them.

Some of the humor worked but Marvel has to stop ruining emotional moments with jokes. It's just not working anymore. Humor is fine and necessary but this is not a Will Ferrell movie. They really gotta dial it back on the jokes.

In the end, they took what could've been a truly compelling story involving time travel, lost time with family and they filled the runtime with CGI creatures and jokes about goo and holes. There was also some really odd pacing in the first half. Pretty much everything before Kang is introduced felt chopped up and in the wrong order.  

Hopefully they get through this rough period because after seeing Thor: Love & Thunder and now this, things aren't looking great for the MCU."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan majors stole the show . Very entertaining but not perfect
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Why do they keep wasting great villains in bad films. My god is the MCU hit or miss these days. It baffles me how bad Marvel Studios CGI is sometimes. Please give the VFX teams more time to work on these movies ffs. I used to get mad when people said these movies are made for kids, but now I see their point. Guess we dont have to worry about Kang if THAT was the most dangerous one. Congratulations on making the supposed next Thanos the least scary villain of all."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a great film, funny & a conduit into phase 5 of the marvel universe & leaves us all wanting the next instalment!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't get the hate.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Middling Marvel movie.  Charming cast.  So many effects it was hard to ground yourself in the story.  It'll be interesting to see what they do with Kang in the future.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,a lot of action and mystery really enjoyed it looking forward to part 2 !!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not at all what I expected. More like a Star Wars plug in.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Poor writing, poor ADR, missed lines, incomplete lines (that dont make sense), bad CG. Whole movie to develop a bad guy and they fall flat. Lots of time in the middle not developing the people they will save. There's literally a part in the movie where Scotts Daughter gets blamed because her captors are mad that someone's coming for her.
They blame Scott for a whole bunch of stuff, not like he wasnt saving the world or reversing the snap."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very very bored, predictable and green screen"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,loved it 2nd time watching it
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the most fun Marvel movie I've seen in years. The humor worked and the pacing was quick. It feels like the MCU is building towards something big and exciting again. Kang is a great villain. Stay for the two end credit scenes. They are actually meaningful and not silly jokes.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, perfect film"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great start to Phase 5 of the MCU. Story, villain, characters all great."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"this was a fun movie, visually stunning, and overall i was pleasantly surprised after feeling a bit down about the last few Marvel flix"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast paced, but great visual scenes."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Special effects 5 stars. Movie 4
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything but modok
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie.  It had a great villain, and tremendous action sequences."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible all the way around.  The only thing I liked about it was when it was over.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie. Visuals, storyline all A+."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining!!  Marvel needs stop admitting critics who dont appreciate stories from mcu.  Phifer and Majors clearly made the movie. Whats to not love about Rudd.  New Cassie - I am a believer.  Feige clearly knew something about this actress.  Loki 2 cant come soon enough.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understanf the critic reviews at all. It""s a comic book movie, it feels like a comic book movie.   It's colorful, silly, action packed, and overall just fun.   Paul Rudd and crew were at their normal best and Jonathan Majors is absolute pleasure to watch as Kang. Im glad we'll be seeing plenty more of him in the future.  

Critics need to get their heads out of their ***es because they are out of touch.  This isn't an art piece, it's not some emotionally charged drama,  it's a SUPERHERO COMIC BOOK but in movie form and a fantastic one at that."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Very similar feel to Thor Ragnarok. Enjoyed it.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good and great action.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Main characters were incredibly annoying, found myself rooting for Kahn for the majority of the movie. The CGI was nice though."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not perfect, but it entertained me the entire way. Not sure why all the hate. It sets up an interesting phase 5."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathon Majors offers a completely different and unique perspective of his character in this movie compared to Loki. It's entertaining to see such brilliant acting. The story asks big questions about Scott's life and the strings being pulled behind it. The plot can get clunky throughout. Recommend watching on big screen for the beautiful CGI.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy entretenida y Para nada aburrido, esperaba un Poquito m√°s Sobre el final Pero en lo Particular Me gusto los personajes (a Excepci√≥n de MODOK)"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I always google who wrote the screen play first. I knew I was in trouble. Marvels writing is just terrible. The plot was all over the place.  Paul Rudd saying ""My his very real book"" was stupid pronoun crap. Not proper English. Michelle Pheiffer looked great and gave a great performance but you had great actors working with a script which did not make sense and had no flow.Things I liked. Kang's outfit  it was comic book accurate. Quantumania looked like Roger Deans artwork on Yes's albums so I liked the look. Cassie was very antifa type but it was cool she became Stature setting up young Avengers. I actually like the idea of Young Avengers and with Kang you can bring in Iron Lad as well. Didn't hate it but wish they would have said where Scott's friends went they just kinda disappeared. Not a good way to kick off for Phase 5."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a fun movie and the effects were great.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid start to phase 5!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a really fun romp, high-concept sci-fi adventure. On par with the other Ant-Man films, which were never very well received critically, but never fail to be enjoyable.

As with the other Ant-Man films, the comedy comes first, but they were able to balance it very well with serious moments in this film. Kang the Conquerer is very menacing, and up there with the most entertaining and scary villains the MCU has to offer.

On the negative, the editing is strange. It's very fast paced, which lends to the sometimes very manic feel of this film. This works pretty well in some sequences, but the pace is maintained in sequences that are meant to be slower and lower energy.

As well as this, the Act 2 climax felt slightly rushed, as well as the ""Deus Ex Ants"" in the 3rd Act that felt a bit low-effort . I would have appreciated more setup for that specific plot device. What the film could have benefitted from was a slightly longer runtime (which was modest for the MCU, only coming it at 2:05) that would have let the ideas presented in those sections flow slightly better and have more room to breathe.

The mid and post-credits scenes were a return to form for the MCU's claim to fame. They elegantly and succinctly set up Kang's next few appearances, as well as giving us a look at a few beloved characters in their next outing. Very much a traditional post-credits sequence, but very successful in what it set out to do.

The score was incredible. Christophe Beck never disappoints, especially in the new version of the main Ant-Man theme."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"while not the best Marvel movie, it had to set up the whole next phase of Marvel and that it did well.  the villian was top notch. the humor wad also very good."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"FYI, I‚Äôm not a fan of the Ant-Man movies, or Ant-Man himself, but I actually enjoyed the movie. It‚Äôs pacing is pretty good, and most of the jokes are funny. Love MODOK, so disgusting, but really funny, and kind of sad. Unlike the other 2 movies, I will watch this again."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Marvel is slipping a bit lately. This wasn't bad but wasn't great either like several other instalments since Endgame. They're becoming just a jumble of hard to follow action & CGI with very little in regards to a story.  This story could have been told in under 15 mins.  We need the Avengers together again.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!!  MODOK stole the show!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A pretty good kickoff to Phase 5. Introduces a ne world with it's mind blowing wonders and weird twists. Sets up this phase wonderfully with many new paths to go. The end credits scenes gave this film another star.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie wastes almost no time getting into the Quantum Realm which is ok I suppose, it has a lot of stories about the people who are affected by Kang who will potentially return in future titles.
Jonathan Majors is superb in his role as Kang, sure we could've had more time with Kang scenes however every scene he was in he stole the spotlight always!
The future of the MCU is definitely more interesting after watching this movie as it was with Doctor Strange 2.
Never trust a Marvel critic!
This movie is not bad!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok.  Ant man is just not as exciting as the other marvel characters.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible movie stupid doest‚Äôt worth it.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was fine, the jokes were at least half decent, and the acting was good. Kang definatly carries this movie, but I like the dynamic between Scot and Cassie as well, however I wish we'd seen more of their relationship and see it grow more by the end of the movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and theater! I highly recommend and also sign up for their rewards program!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Delivers on everything the previous installment, miss the mark with. While simultaneously building on an already seemingly infinite world by going not up or out, but in, by literally delving into a new world of the quantum realm. The cavalcade of characters we‚Äôve come to know and love who is truncated, momentarily it‚Äôs of jarring, because you‚Äôre afraid that the dynamic between the core cast is going to change. But that concern is it‚Äôs quickly abated by cavalcade of the new interesting characters and conflict that is clearly a steppingstone to the next chapter of the MCU. And Ant-man and the wasp: quantamania is a important, fresh and welcomed addition to the ever-growing catalog of the marvel universe. obviously, you cannot jump in to this chapter of the ant man saga without seeing the two previous installments so it‚Äôs rather helpful to see the first two films (at least) first."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,love it great movie with a great villain.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Just as corny as expected lol
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's amazing. I enjoyed so much.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a fun watch from beginning to end.  It's important to embrace weirdness on this movie.   Remember, this is based on comic books and there's a certain level of fantasy to it, and without keeping that in mind it's easy focus on what ""couldn't really happen"", and if you do that, you'll miss out on a very fun, entertaining, and exciting movie that will have you cheering out loud throughout most of the movie.

BTW, stay for the post credits scenes, they're important."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was amazing and I would 100% recommend watching it!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful cgi,  terrible script. 
Antman is a sideshow in his own movie"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie, I felt some gaps in the script but the movie achieves its goal Kang is a complicated character due to all his variants and although he still doesn't seem like a real threat his next variants should turn the UCM around."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful dialogue and repetitive jokes.
Janet and Cassie are extremely obnoxious."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you watched the Loki series, you fall right into place. Kang makes the movieüëåüèæ"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it and can‚Äôt wait to see the next installment of the MCU
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Reminded me of Fantastic Voyage. Paul Rudd was great. Johnathan Majors is a cool villain. Kathryn Newton is another gem in the MCU. üëç
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best ant man so far!!! Loved it!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of action. You learn more about Kang and how badass he is and the 2 after credit scenes are worth staying for. This was a good introduction to Phase V. There wasnt as much humor as the first 2 movies, so dont go in expecting the same silliness that was in the second movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movies proves something I think we've all known for a very long time: professional movie reviewers are the single least intelligent demographic in America. The movie is fun and action packed, Jonathan Majors' Kang was iconic, and MODOK's arc was such a perfect encapsulation of Darren Cross' character in the MCU. Yes, it finished with a bug CGI brouhaha - it's a marvel movie, but the substance attached to that was fantastic. Also, brilliant choice to have Michael Douglas lean all the way into the ants memes."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this movie and don't understand the low critic ratings. I hope people go and watch it to decide for themselves and not let the critics reviews deter them. Funny movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, especially if you understand how it connects with the shows and previous movies. If you don't, then it may be a little confusing. 

3 stars if you're not a fan, and 4 if you are. 

The father/daughter relationship that this movie sits around can hit home sometimes, but feel forced in other moments. 

Altogether, it introduces Kang very well to the cinematic audience. The next MCU phase should be fun to watch!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a good movie.. really enjoyed the production visuals just felt like it was missing something. Overall a good movie just not at the top of my list for marvel movies.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a at times funny and cool movie to experience. THE GOOD
This movie is packed full of jokes that will make you laugh. The action in this movie is no doubt good. The third act is by far the best part of the movie, it is a good ending and leaves you thinking. M.O.D.O.K is a cool but unnecessary addition, his reveal is sweet.
THE MIXED
The first act of this movie is flown by and it's hard to keep up and even though this is easy to understand they make it so unnecessarily complicated and convoluted that you end up asking yourself what just happened? 
THE BAD
The pace of this movie is all over the place, for 30 minutes it could be slow then the next 10 minutes it's so fast you have no idea what's going on. The plot of this movie is not good, the whole way they get into the quantum realm is by slamming her hand on a machine that she made in 20 minutes with no context? Wow. Kang is built up the whole movie as some big powerful indestructible figure than they just throw some ants on him.  Modok is very weak."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I drank the ooze. An all right start, a messy second act, and a fairly strong finish. Was it the best Marvel movie? No. But I was entertained and still very excited to see the future of the Kang Dynasty."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved Ant-Man Quantumania A LOT more then I thought I would!Best of the trilogy!

 It is a crazy ride of a movie, but boy does it have huge amounts of emotion between the cast that just makes it so fun to watch. Also the set pieces were the best they've done since the guardians movies. A must see movie if you've missed a little bit of that marvel fun from recent projects."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too much travel into the quantum, lots of space stuff"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the humour, the new characters and the way the story evolved‚Ä¶ as a Marvel fan as with all the MCU movies, I went in without expectation and came out enjoying what I saw and this was no exception."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel are back on form with this one! Non stop action from the get go, Paul Rudd brings the humor and the makes this character really likeable, I loved hat they did with modok but Jonathan Majors as Kang stole the show for me, the MCU is in good hands with Majors as the next marvel big bad. Thoroughly enjoyed this and hopefully it is a sign of things to come for phase 5"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Totally wild and awesome.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"La cinta de queda muy corta en el desarrollo, con textos muy cortos. Literal, la cinta fue gritos y chistes todo el tiempo, Kang es lo mejor!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, lots of action !"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it! Fun, funny, just a great time!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie , the kids loved it!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This was certainly one of the movies of all time üëçüèª
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Story was bland.  Not very exciting or universe building.  Visuals were great but too much came and went without much explanation.  Kang is a good bad guy but I remember Thanos first movie and you got the sense not all of the Avengers were going to make it.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved it! Critics are just desperate to look edgy by hating it. Came out the cinema grinning from ear to ear. Can't wait to go and see it again.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked but it need more of the 3D affect
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely the best Antman and the Wasp movie I've seen so far, and I wasn't the biggest fan of the previous two. Great balance of legit laugh out loud humour and fist to fist action sequences. The final showdown in particular was both an adrenaline fueling and an anxiety inducing ride, I'm not even kidding. Nice to see a much more mature post-Endgame Scott Lang and the complexities of witnessing his daughter become an adult are heart warming. It's message on family is at the front of centre and I was totally in. Kang is an ominous figure played so compellingly by the great Jonathan Majors. Thanos eat your heart out. I had a great time in the quantum realm and would happily revisit."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the hate. The movie did get off to a sort of slow start, but the plot, characters, cgi and villian were all amazing. Not the best MCU film, but not even close to the worst."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. The critics are typical. Go see it and enjoy if you have an inkling of an enjoyment of Marvel movies.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was something a little different.  Kinda like Avatar in a way
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie.  good story.  great start for Kang.  ignore any negative eeviews
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyable film, comedy hit well and times right, the action and cgi were also great

The modok change was hilariously good!

Jonathan Majors was absolutely incredible and I genuinely can't wait to see more of him/kang in the future 

It wasn't perfect but it was a fun watch and a really good set up for moving forward in the MCU!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what the critics are smoking. This is a solid, fun and entertaining movie. No dull moments, enough action and the right amount of comedy."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Movie. Awesome portrayal of all the characters. It‚Äôs a must see. I would recommend this to anyone. The effects were incredible, I was amazed. I would highly recommend this movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It‚Äôs a fun popcorn movie. Paul Rudd is always a win.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, Great cast, Great action, Great fun!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the story and how it ties in with the multiverse.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is great! Visuals are awesome and the action is up to par.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good not great, could have done a better job introducing us to Kang"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the bad reviews, yes MCU has spun out some rubbish and there is more on the way (Agatha coven of chaos) but I thought this was a great start to phase 5. People need to remember that marvel films are based on comics and need to be filled with action and excitement but also be light hearted and funny, this film captured that perfectly (unlike Thor Love and Thunder which almost felt like a spoof movie)."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good minus some iffy visuals.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie,lots of fun humor and Paul Rudd did an amazing job!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Similar style to Thor Ragnarok. Seems to drag on.  Very Sci fi ish
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Paul Rudd and Michelle Pfeiffer killed it! Loved the bare knuckle fight scene at the end with Kang and the two post-credit scenes.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Special effects were awesome ,story line was expected"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was the best üêú movie yet!! I took all five of my kids to go see it!! The ants in this movie was dope!! It did give me Tron Legacy vibes and thats fine trust me. Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors, Evangeline Lilly, William Jackson Harper, Corey Stoll and Kathryn Newton was sensational. This movie üé• needs to atleast be in the high 80% I don't know what these Critics are talking about but Paul Rudd thank you for being Ant-Man and from Kansas City Kansas like me!!! Go Chiefs üòÖ"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kept hearing negative things about it but to my surprise it was a good movie and had good laughs, you cant always listen to other people's opinions and just see for yourself, yes theres a lot going on and weird things, but if you just put yourself in the face its a pocket universe where anything could be possible, overall not a bad movie that its being said to be I enjoyed it"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"the movie is enjoyable, the action and the build up of tension before showing the villain was good too! i was invested in the story they were telling, and the comedy wasn‚Äôt taking away from the overall scenes so i was happy that they took more care in how they were delivering comedy along with more emotional scenes. i think the only problem i had with the movie was the over use of the cgi and the costuming of certain villains. the cgi at this point takes away from the realism of the movie, i feel it doesn‚Äôt mesh that well with certain scenes. something feels missing or off about backgrounds/sets. the design choices for the two villains were also not my favorite. but otherwise, the story is interesting and i‚Äôm curious to know where they‚Äôre going to take our new villain next. i loved the characters and their relationships, and i loved the tidbits they shared about kang."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was decent. Kang is a physically imposing villain but he lacks a background story that makes you feel for him like Thanos did. Couple that with the tried and true Marvel movie experience and you have a movie that could've been better.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The humor from the first two ant man movies are completely removed, the story is slow. It has a few good moments but overall one of marvel‚Äôs worst such a disappointment"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel peaked with Infinity War & died with Tony and End game, everything since ( Spider-Man aside) has been dreadful.
This is just another terrible Marvel movie"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is fun, funny and witty. With all the charm of the last 2 but you can see how Ant-man has developed as a character in the wider MCU and this is a good fun movie which leaps off the Quantum-verse. Outstanding performances from Jonathan Majors as the entrance of a new villain for this phase. The only thing I did miss was the heist chat from Louis. But all in all, critics being hyper critical. It's a fun marvel movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,loved the movie. Can't wait to see where they go with Kang.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie! Great 3D effects could have had more during the fight scenes.. bad part was being in a theatre with giggly running kids that were too young for this movie!! Annoying!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,So awesome!! Can‚Äôt wait to see it again.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great! Though the quantum realm was oddly similar to Disney‚Äôs Strange World, the realm, creatures and characters along with the cinematography was unreal! If everyone could get over there send Gmae expectations for every Marvel movie, this is 4/5 stars all day! The next send Game is coming! Gotta build up to it and this proved Loki was the uprising! Great movie!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Johnathan Majors killed this role and made this movie!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a good addition to the Ant Man trilogy, Modok felt like and after thought and The Wasp was a bit of an extra but Ant Man, Kang and some of the support characters were fun, overall I enjoyed it more than Wakanda Forever - don't come for me!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jodidamente aburrida üò¥
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun and a little cheesy at times but overall enjoyable
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved this movie. I'm a huge Marvel fan to begin with. I thought it was very funny at the right times, serious when it needed to be serious. I loved Jonathan Majors as Kang and his variants. MODOK was great, though I wish they would have kept him around. It wasn't perfect but they really captured the essence of who MODOK is in the comics."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was just‚Ä¶ok. There was something missing from it but I can‚Äôt put my finger on it. It was less than what I was expecting but it wasn‚Äôt a failure either. Hoping the next Marvel installments will be more captivating.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don't actually understand why the critics have picked this film to hate on. Is it the best Marvel movie? No. Is it a bad Marvel movie. No. Did I enjoy it? Yes. It is fun, a bit Star Warsy but I was thoroughly entertained. Both Thor Love and Thunder and Wakanda forever had big issues (the first too stupid, the second too boring) but whilst Ant man has some questionable decisions and you can certainly pick holes in the plot, its basic story is fine. Theres a bad guy, someone needs rescuing, the heroes do their job in a entertaining manner. And, Kang is a good bad guy, which Marvel has only had a few of. I think Kang will be a good successor to Thanos. J. Majors certainly has the presence and I look forward to his return. Anyway, this movie is a solid 7, maybe even an 8. I would certainly rewatch this again. Yeah, I'll give it an 8 for that reason alone. Go watch it"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"More like a 5/10, closer to a 4 than a 6. The fun factor is like riding a roller coaster that goes up, down then straight until the final 30 seconds where it gets fun.
The movie has lots of cool characters and scenery in the background very much like a Star Wars film but barely does anything with it. The movie has plenty of set up for an anti-climatic ending."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Un enga√±o!! La peor manera de iniciar esta nueva fase.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Most fun I've had a movie in a long time...watch for ""How many holes do you have?"" I almost died laughing..."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The special effects were fantastic, Overall great movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a blast.  One of the best Marvel movies for along time.  This was a much different Ant Man - more action, effects, heart, humor.  The stakes feel much bigger, with Kang being powerful and ruthless.  Having Ant Man's daughter grow up and becoming a hero in her own right felt right.  Whereas many of the other ""teen heroes"" feel forced and out of place, this felt so much more natural and organic."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great! Incredible special effects, witty dialogue, A list actors of all ages, lots of fun!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It dragged, to many silly moments from Paul Ruggs character (Ant-Man) and where was Luis?"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The dazzling and wacky CGI set pieces can't distract the viewer from a half baked plot, meaningless action and drama, and a cheap win for the ""good guys"". Jonathan Majors as Kang carries the film, and will probably need to carry most of the MCU from now on."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang is good. Final Battle is insane. The humour is ok. Characters are ok and Cassie with Scott steal the scene. It's a good beginning for the Multiverse Saga.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Nonsensical story.  It amazes me the actors could do their job with so much of it not even real. Digital everything that was instantly forgettable.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,This was a good movie but I'd rather have seen a story about Scott & Hope ( Antman & the Wasp) instead of a film that relies on special effects almost exclusively
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It¬¥s a Ok movie. I am nothing expecting anything good from Marvel anyway. But, it is reasonable compare with other Marvels movie recently launched."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great performances and lots of action. This movie sets up the next few years of Marvel movie greatness. A must see for Marvel fans.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Visually stunning and lots of fun. Exactly what I was expecting with lots of gorgeous visual references to the comic book material it draws from. Fun set-up for the next big Marvel villain. Everyone I was with enjoyed it immensely.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The first half of the film is weak and the jokes don't often land, but once Jonathan Majors as Kang appears, it's far more engrossing. Wish it was better overall, but worth watching for the second half."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang is the next thanos! Honestly all I could think about after watching it and walking out of the theater was how are the avengers going to defeat this guy in Kang Dynasty
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,This is a fun movie highly recommend it
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved this movie due to the comedy and heart even in the action scenes
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't understand the hate I thought it was amazing i watched it in 4DX that only added to the experience the critics are so wrong about this film
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining movie, typical Antman movie"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Crazy and entertaining movie! I was expecting it to be zany and crazy, and I really enjoyed it. It was in a realm where almost anything goes. Great adventure, great acting, and great special effects!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,i really liked the part when the ants came to win over the fight towards the end.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathon Major's Kang (and others to follow) is agile and nefarious, a compliment to the MCU, in a devastating way. His introduction was Childs play for the directors, the rest of the movie is filler for phase 5, the 'ums' and 'ers' of conversation."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie! that acting by all characters was fantastic Janet stole the show Cassie was great!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too much special effects, not enough story between the real people."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics went too hard on this one.  it was entertaining and absolutely enjoyable.  The 3rd act had some hiccups in dialogue, but overall it played out well enough."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didnt like Janet being so elusive with information and how that subject was dragged on and on.  Boring.  Jonathan Majors was awesome!  Rudd and crew were funny as usual!  Great all round movie, excited for the next Kang movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There are elements of this movie that are fun and interesting-just not enough.   Marvel's deep dive into the Multiverse has become common place and confusing and lacking in the essential elements that made these movies so much fun.  This one involves a problem not coming from the exterior, but created within, and that makes it not as interesting or easy to care about.  The characters are good.  Paul Rudd is fun as the lead- he managed to strike the right balance always as a marginal superhero.   Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, and Michelle Pfeiifer are very good.  Jonathan Majors is terrific as the villain.   Bill Murray has a quirky and fun role.   The problem is that it is all not enough to save this one.  I would wait till it hits Disney Plus and manage my expectations.   Better than The Eternals, but worse than most."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was awesome a love my movie critics from Double Toasted, Heavy Spoilers, 3C Films, and Beyond the Trailer (sometimes not so much). You guys seem to have lost prospective on what entertains us the general audience. Sometimes it seems you can't  see the forest for the trees. Great movie overall phase 5 off to a great start!!!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great Movie. I suggest all Marvel fans watch it. Not as big for the entire MCU Kang Dynasty as it could have been but still a good movie, and still provides some MCU Kang's Dynasty info needed."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst movie I have ever seen...no storie!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This move was excellent with marvelous open caption.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than I anticipated since multiverse of madness didn't do so well. Kang is the best villain seen in the MCU yet
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I guess to small children, the return of a character from the first movie would be funny, but to most Marvel fans, the appearance and continuous appearance in the movie is the reason the reviews aren't better than they could have been. But I'm looking forward to more appearances by Jonathan Majors."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it, it was 100% an Antman movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun ride.  Visually it was very impressive and much to take in.  Marvel is definitely world building with this movie and you will walk away anticipating what comes next.  I was concerned when I saw the critics reviews but walked away wondering what movie they saw to score so badly.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It‚Äôs a must see. Long story short, Kang is that guy and this was one of the better MCU films of all time in my opinion"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"God these Marvel movies are getting SOULLESS. Super derivative, plagiarizing not only Star Wars but its own property Thor Ragnarok! It's all unimpressive CGI, no real plot, and actors clearing phoning it in, except for Michelle Pfeiffer and MAJOR exception for Jonathan Majors as Kang. Man's up on that screen acting like he's in Shakespeare. Definitely looking forward to the conquering Kang is gonna do."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a really good movie. 
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"""What if George Lucas made an Antman movie?"" Now we know! Great flick."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"So there is lots to like about this film and while there was a character that didn't make sense to me due to their lack of transparency (that felt a little forced).  Apart from that, I found the movie to be exciting, funny, with really interesting characters.  Definitely worth the full screen 3-d experience."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie with a good heart. The visuals are great! The father-daughter relationship between Scott (Paul Rudd) & Cassie (Kathryn Newton) is terrific. Jonathan Majors plays Kang to perfection. Michelle Pfeiffer carries a lot of the early part of the movie. The ants have a more minor role but come up big. Whether our heroes are victorious, in the end, is an open question."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"NO just no marvel, what is this, kang is the only reason im giving this a star."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. People are giving it bad reviews for what reason?  I mean it tells a story and keeps you entertained. I was not upset I saw it. I would watch it again.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don‚Äôt get it, I had a blast with Pym/Lang family. It‚Äôs non-stop adventure and action, I enjoyed the entire cast and John Majors is a force, can‚Äôt wait to see his dynasty. If you want fun and a good escape go see this one."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is wizard of oz, John Carter of earth and Rick and Morty all smashed together. It's awesome."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good action, and acting. Time in the quantum realm was too long. More time on 'earth' would have been better."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great introduction of Kang the Conqueror. Movie took a more serious tone, but still had plenty of laughs. Can‚Äôt wait to see more of the overarching villain and his variants in the coming MCU projects."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Michelle Pfeiffer shines as the original Wasp and Jonathan Majors is a fearful villain in this family heartwarming latest adventure of Marvel's Ant-Man. Loved the family dynamic in this movie, lots of action sprinkled with heartwarming moments throughout and good humor. Paul Rudd continues delivering a compelling hero and his father dynamic with newcomer Kathryn Newton is charming and convincing as is the chemistry between veterans Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas as the classic comic characters Janet & Hank Pym!   The best of the Ant-Man franchise!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know WHAT movie the critics were watching, this movie was AMAZING from start to finish. Think Thor Ragnarok but with slightly more action."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was like the pre endgame movies. concentrating on the Ant Man family and not other established characters. I like when assorted characters from the MCU interact but it doesn't have to be every time we see one we get multiple avengers....
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched this movie on it's premiere, I find it unbelievable it's getting bad ratings. This movie was fun not great but enjoyable. This movie was worth my time and money."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't get why the critics hate this movie so much. The performances of Paul Rudd and Johnathan Majors were amazing. I do wish we got more destruction from Kang but it was overall a good movie and had the charm from the other Ant-man Movies
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Marvel never disappoints
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Creo que es un s√≥lido 6 de 10, no es mala pero tampoco es algo del otro mundo."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was entertaining,  was it great, no but (and I expect some heat), it was better than Black Panther Wakanda Forever"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a fun experience. I could sit here and talk about how the visuals have unfinished renders or how there are plot conveniences, but ultimately none of that mattered with how entertained I was. Jonathan Majors as Kang is phenomenal. He easily steals the show, and will continue to do so as far as I can tell. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang has little to do comparatively, but I was invested in his father-daughter dynamic with Cassie. Bill Murray, Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas give performances that are memorable and just enough for this delightful film. Hope's story is severally lacking considering she's a title character, but I liked her design and role in the movie most of the time. Modok worked for me, but will not for many. I think he brought a dynamic to this film that fit the tone of Ant-Man series thus far. These movies have been goofy, silly, and even absurd, so I see M.O.D.O.K as no different. I missed the presence of Michael Pena's Luis, but I can understand how he could be cut for time. Overall, yes this movie has flaws, just as any movie will inevitably. I do think, however, this film is a great start for the fifth phase of the MCU, but can also be viewed as a solid standalone Ant-Man movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Marvel kinda made a Star Wars film‚Ä¶and I enjoyed it a lot. 
There was an excellent cameo in the middle act. 
Amazing aliens and a Star Wars style cantina scene. 
The scope and scale of this movie was quite a thing to see. 
MODOK was great imo. The criticism of that character is peak internet since it's comic accurate. There's really no way to get around that MODOK is just a goofy character. 
I could see why the professional critics hate it, but the fans love it. 
This movie is and will be appreciated by true Marvel fans. 
It was a fun ride!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a fan of the MCU already you will truly enjoy this. It has the extra silliness that makes Ant Man special. A different take on MODOK but I enjoyed him much more than I thought I would. If you were not entertained, then you are probably not a fan in the first place."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you can manage your expectations, this movie is a very fun and hilarious ride. But if you are expecting anything else -like real consequences- you will be disappointed."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good movie with stunning visuals. Not great but super interesting and a great setup for future marvel films. The end credits were spectacular.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action with epic effects
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually creative, the plot and jokes are a bit thin but the world they create is interesting and Jonathan majors performance is worth the price of admission"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good but predictable. Cant wait to see Mobius and Loki again!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoy it some of the jokes are funny and others are not funny but holy shit Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror is really the best MCU villain since Loki and Thanos.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Hade a great time ...It was fun !
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great start for phase 5. Johnathan Majors was perfect and shines beyond what I was expecting, especially with the end credits. Loved seeing the world of the quantum realm. Only part I didn't loke was Cassie as a whole. I didnt think the actress felt authentic"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,important movie for the next marvel phase.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed everything! About it
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Its actually a good movie despite some flaws!!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I loved the addition of Cassie, as well as some of the new characters."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,it was a very entertaining movie  üé¨. My wife was able to follow the movie fine and enjoyed it. That is my barometer. I really loved it and think the Press who gave it bad reviews have an agenda.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great move.  With lots of action.    And a good  storyline.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, it plays like a spiritual descendant of Star Wars, Dune, and Ready PlaYer One.  While the actress recast as Cassie Lang does a fine job, I'm generally irritated by senseless recastings like this.  Fortunately, Marvels track record of version 2 actors (i.e. Don Cheadle as Rhodey aka War Machine) has been solid and QuantumMania isn't an exception.  

I thought this was an interesting adventure with a lot of focus on Michelle Pfeoffers Wasp which, given her decades long stint of being missing deserved to get some light shed on her going ons.  Jonathan Majors is a very solid villain, which pleased me greatly.  

I don't know how well this all plaYs if you aren't familiar with Ant Man or the events of the Disney+ series Loki or if you've not followed both Dr Strange and the Multiverse of Madness along with SpiderMan: No Way Home.  I think the comic book audience is perfectly fine with this entry.  I think the General audience could get confused, and I think it's difficult to get a sense of the stakes, but I'd say the rating of below 50% is overstated on the tomatometer.   Instead trust the audience score.  Presuming it's still in the 80% range, It's more accurate.

I think I'll watch it again with a different group of friends, so to me that's a good sign."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,F the haters. all the bad reviews are from people who want the movie and marvel to fail. the movie was perfectly fine. script and plot were fine. action was fine. Kang was great. good overall movie
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a mess. Weak story, dreary Cinematography, laughable visual effects. Phase 5 starts with a whimper and not a bang. What the hell has happened with the quality of the MCU since phase 3?"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked this movie because there is a lot of humor and action.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant Man Quantamania is a wonderful introduction to Kang as Phase 5 begins, however, the movie lacks the atmosphere that made the previous 2 movies what was fun about Ant man. Marvel once again struggles with tone as they can't seem to let things be serious. I'll say Kang is amazing, the father daughter relationshipnis done well and the look of the quantum realm is beautifully asthetic, the movie is brought down but weird plot line choices and the horrible execution of MODOK. Enjoyed the film overall but it has serious issues that can't be ignored. 6.5/10"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't let the reviews tell you otherwise this movie was super good and it was a fun and fantastic adventure with some of the familiar characters and new characters into one movie. 10/10
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"QUANTUMANIA is arguably as most visually creative and narratively safe film in the MCU to date.  While it pushes a lot of the overarching MCU forward (sacrificing the Little Guy energy Ant-man has always been best known for in the process) its story beats do little to surprise the audience and feel somewhat status quo.  Even in its predictability, it‚Äôs a fun and unique take on a universe many fans have become familiar with.  Johnathan Majors is the scene stealer who caps out a trilogy of films with very few weak points."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good job introducing Kang, but they did M.O.D.O.K. wrong. All in all, an enjoyable two-hours."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is the best in the ant man trilogy, Had me on the edge of my seat. Broccoli man,Daren, baskin robins ant man, and the holes dude solo all verses. The scene with Daren were he dramatically and epically speeds toward kangs shield yelling ""i am Daren, not a dick. HELLO"" should be on everyone top ten scenes of all time. If I could rate higher i would."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was better than I expected. I was worried there would be too much humor but it was better balanced than I originally anticipated. Although I enjoyed the movie it's not something I will watch again. It feels more of a fill in for something better, hence Kang Dynasty or Loki Season 2. All in all I recommend A&W:Q to follow up with the MCU continuity."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought it was a bad Star Wars prequel rip off. I really didn't like the tone. It never really got me to buy it. I think they have lost their fastball a little bit.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a mess. Tired tropes, CGI overload, humor that misses, nothing feels of any consequence. One star for the one bright spot of Jonathan Majors."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was action pack. I mean not a dull moment. don't drink a lot because if you go to the bathroom you gonna miss a lot. I love how at the end there is more and if you let all the credits roll there is even more.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel is sadly going downhill, 
This is a prime example."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,An interesting sci-fi ride. Kang the Conquorer delivers.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed the movie. But very tired if the 40-50 year old fratboy humor of Ant-Man, Thor Love and Thunder, Guardians of the Galaxy and Ruffalo's version of Bruce Banner."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Entertaining, with a hint of forcing new castings down your throat."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I can see why the Critics has a rotten rating. It definitely has flaws and things that it could of done better, but as an overall experience, it kept me entertained throughout."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it!!! As always Antman is another good movie to the list of Marvel movies and Kang is great in this movie
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Decent film, fun visuals and plot line. Humor was a bit off at times, and the effects on modok without the mask were atrocious."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is okay. It feels a bit rushed at the start but it takes its time building up to the introduction of Kang in a very lazy way, not to mention the fact that he didn't feel as threatening as Thanos did. The thing that made Thanos so threatening was missing in Kang. Other than that, it didn't feel like an Ant-Man movie. It just doesn't give you the feeling that the first two Ant-Man movies did, like it was just made to introduce Kang The Conqueror as the next big Thanos level villain which it even failed to do."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Terrific family fun, great comedy and adventure. Heroes are outstanding and Kang is a great villian. Truly loved this movie. Not understanding the negatives reviews, entire family loved this film."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I actually created an account specifically to review this because I don't think that critic score is fair at all. I'm pretty confused about some of the feedback too. This has been my favorite marvel movie since Doctor Strange: MoM. I wasn't bored at any point and that's saying something because the last few have been snoozy at certain parts. It was fun, family focused without being cheesy and as fpr the star wars commentary, there was really only one scene that felt like star wars to me and it was a fairly short scene. Definitely go watch this."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Antman movie was a great introducing a new type of fearful antagonist to the marvel universe, kang the conqueror and the dynasty at the end that will unfold into the phase 4 of marvel"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great villain in Kang. Good special effects. Not as much humor as the first two ant man movies but still funny in places. Definitely a much watch for any Marvel fan.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's not as bad as critics say but it's not as good as fans say either.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worse movie I‚Äôve seen in several years. It‚Äôs all CGI mess. The backstory didn‚Äôt move me or make me root for any of them. Jonathan Major‚Äôs acting elevated this movie a tiny bit but could not keep it afloat. 
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie I loved it
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the way it progresses the storyline for antman
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was awesome, critics can kiss my ass"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Agora eu sei que n√£o tem como confiar nos cr√≠ticos.
O filme n√£o √© perfeito, mas √© muito bom sim, muito melhor que She Hulk."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie!!! I loved it!!! It has action the whole time! Funny! 5 stars !!! Perfect for Marvel fans!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best ant man movies
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Whilst Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania is not perfect but not bad due to its issues with parts of the pacing and script, Jonathan Majors certainly shines within his role as Kang the Conquerer which be a main threat going onward whilst Paul Rudd's performance still shows charisma."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Cool visuals with a great performance from Johnston majors.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly I went into this movie with some low expectations and the entire time I was watching the movie I could not figure out what everybody was complaining about. Not every movie has to have someone die or have some tragic event. Not every movie has to be super serious. I'd rather enjoyed the quantum mechanics references in the movie being a science nerd myself. M.O.D.O.K. has always been a throw away henchman type villain and I appreciate the creativity they had with the character's new origin. There were a few things I wasn't as happy about but not very many. Honestly I don't know what kind of movie everybody thought it was going to be. It's exactly what I pictured. I loved it though.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute banger if you like marvel movies. Jonathan Majors is spectacular
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics - ""ALL SCOTT TALKS ABOUT IS CASSIE"" Umm, it's literally core to his origin story. ""ITS ALL CGI!"" yeah, guess they didn't have the budget to film in the real Quantum Realm... I suppose if you walk into this movie with zero knowledge of the MCU, you won't get this movie. However, if you're invested in the store at all, it's highly enjoyable. The ""critics"" are way off base here."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I think the MCU is now officially past its prime. There were only 2 phase four movies that I really liked, Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home. Thor 4 was ok but all the rest was boring garbage. The Ant Man movies always had a disadvantage because hack director Peyton Reed was attached to them but on top of that, Quantumania's script is pretty bad too. They seem to have officially run our of ideas for fun setpieces with the Ant Man powers. The plot is so incredibly bland, it's amazing I still enjoyed this movie more than most of the crap from phase four. The Quantum realm looked boring as hell. It couldn't be more obvious that the actors are just in front of a green screen all the time with a stock sci-fi background they found on Google images inserted in post. Compare this crap to the Avatar movies, those are basically all CGI and look super realistic. None of the main characters learn, grow (not like that) or have a character arc. Michelle Pfeiffer's character is stupid and annoying but at least the other main characters are still likeable. It's amazing that a movie with a shlock title set in the quantum realm, starring Paul Rudd, can be this bland."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Maannnnn this movie was Fire, these critics and youtbers had me thinking this was about to be straight up doodoo water and It definitely was not. Was it the next coming of film making??HELL NO. Was it entertaining and fun to watch?? HELL YES. The CGI is a little weird in some spots but besides that this was fun to go see.

 Johnathan majors was a smooth criminal just how Kang is in the Comics and he really didn't care about anything except that his plans are achieved. That's a cold blooded Ngga right there lol. I went with some friends on Premiere night and we all enjoyed it , legit , IDK what all the negative fuss is about besides some things you could Nit-pick to death. I'm actually going to go watch it again myself tonight that will be the 3rd time I have seen this."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow....just wow.....
Not as bad a Thor 4 mind you but christ this was rough to get through"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know why it got bad reviews from the critics. It is a  good story, lots of action and some of the normal antman humor thrown in.   Classic Marvel movie"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not as much ""fun"" as previous installments, but no less enjoyable. I have a few minor ""complaints,"" but nothing particularly egregious. Very solid start to Phase 5."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm not sure why there is so much hate for this movie. I have seen all Marvel movies and I think the Ant-Man movies are second best only to the Iron-man trilogy. Visually beautiful and a good story. I think some people who have it actually watched all of marvel probably just won't get it but each movie they come out with is kind of like an episode to a show that you have to wait till the next one comes out to understand it completely. Either way two thumbs up I absolutely love this movie
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""I've got Holes!""
""My name is Darren, and I am not a Dick!""
Someone was seriously payed to write that‚Ä¶

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is by far the weirdest MCU Movie yet, it feels like Rick and Morty & Star Wars mixed together which was kinda cool to see in a Marvel Movie! Jonathan Majors is the by far the best part of this Movie showing how big of a threat Kang the Conqueror is even though he sort of gets beaten by ants for some reason, also Modok is one of the things that makes this Movie horrible because he is way to goofy and his CGI is just awful. Also Cassie throughout the whole movie is just annoying and constantly insulting her father because apparently she thinks she is more of a hero than him which isn't even close to true. The Movie has a lot of flaws that are a enormous deal, and the movie takes barely nothing seriously, if the MCU wants to have a great future then they have to up their game because this is just not it. For me this is officially the worst thing from the MCU so far‚Ä¶"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Dont know why the critics are so harsh, Kant was Awesome!!!!!!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a great movie. I personally loved it kept me and the ones i was with questioning what might happen or who might show up next. Dont let any of the critics keep you from watching it if you want to go watch it go.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good, fun movie overall with some great visuals and a decent story. Some minor gripes: 

-Some story points and character choices could have been handled a little bit better. For example, characters avoiding saying Kang's name for the first half of the movie was a little odd and unnecessary. Also, not including certain supporting cast members from the last two movies was a disappointment. The story was fairly solid, but there are some areas where it could have used some tweaks to make it better. 

-The stakes should have been a little bit higher towards the end. Without spoiling, it just felt like we needed a darker ending than we got in terms of who did or didn't survive and who did or didn't escape the Quantum Realm. Would have made Kang much more intimidating as a future threat and solidify some of what he said earlier in the movie. 

-MODOK was fairly entertaining and funny, but I feel like it would have suited the movie a bit better and helped curb some of the complaints of poor CGI had they went with a more grotesque approach to his appearance, similar to the comics. 

Certainly worth watching, and it's pretty on par with other mid-level MCU films. It doesn't make it to the top of the list, but it's far from the worst MCU outing."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure what movie the critics are watching, but they are dead wrong. I have watched all three Ant Man movies and this is by far the best one yet! Stay for the post movie credits- they will tie everything together"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was worth the $4.50 or so I paid to see it. I got tons o' eye candy, and Jonathan Majors was truly good. But Peyton Reed and the studio cluster went the easy, lazy route on this one. They really want even the holy rollers and their kids to come see this one. ""It was just so wholesome, ya know?"" I don't expect that much from Reed, but he seems to know how to work with good writing. So I'll put most of the blame here on writer Jeff Loveness. The 1st two Ant Man movies were written by Rudd and a group of writers with shared ideas and takes that made for better stories, hence, better movies. 
They went big on the schmaltz and melodrama, mixed with poor attempts at humor by bad writing with too many obvious 'jokes'. That aside, there were some legit funny bits. But why not more Bill Murray? That's one of the best scenes. But what's that saying, really?yeah, Majors is strong here as a worthy villian in Kang. Newton is almost a caricature. So many cheeseball lines.
Not going much further into this one. Very formulaic and saccharine. ""Welcome Back""? And I am happy for Darren. 
2.8 stars

2.8 stars"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So many plot holes.
Like much of phase 4 it was entertaining and everyone did their jobs well, but it just had too much that didn't work."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A return to classic Disney family adventure that has themes featuring the little guy winning against impossible odds. I laughed, I cried, I did it all. I don't know why reviewers are hating on this film. It was great the whole time. Maybe the reviewers don't want Americans to see what standing up for what they believe in and fight for rights."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Don‚Äôt believe the anti-hype. It‚Äôs a fun movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was okay. Not great but something to do.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie.. blablabla Marvel bad movies .. blablabla DC bad movies... Dont b a Child and enjoy ...
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Quantumania? More like clich√®mania.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,YYYEESSSSS!!! SOOOOOO GOOOOODDD!!!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is an extremely fun time at the movies.

Sit down. Relax and get ready for a giant adventure"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed it. Was made even better seeing it before the theatre release on a Disney Cruise at night while cruising the Caribbean. Memorable experience. Fun movie. 
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A solid outing! Granted I wanted more Kang Vs Antman! The council of Kang will be a force in the MCU! A must see!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Already looking forward to the next one.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the movie was highly creative and entertaining. It had some great comedic scenes that I thoroughly enjoyed. Seeing it in IMAX 3D was amazing, worth the time and the money."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie. I was on the edge of my seat for a lot of it. The humour was definitely the Ant-Man kind of humor that we've come to expect. The ending was really satisfying and there were a lot of deep chuckle moments. Kang as A villain gave me chills multiple times throughout the movie. A really fun and solid start to phase 5
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,very fun.  it may not be Oscar worthy but it is far better than critics are giving it credit for.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not good not great but just ok.

Kang doesn't hold a candle to Thanos."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,couldve shown Kings power better because i feel like they didnt show his true potential
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fun and greatly enjoyed Paul Rydd and Jonathan Major's performances. However, the movie can be rather messy and predictable. It picks up in the final act though. Preferred the first two Ant-Man movies, but it is not my least favorite MCU movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in knowing it was an Ant-Man sequel and not Endgame. Michelle Pfeiffer shined as Janet van Dyne and the whole cast,  including Paul Rudd, was spot on in their roles as well. Kang's setup was terrifying, and solidified him as a true villain to be feared. This movie has a great mix of humor and tension, and I will be going back to see it again."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was hard to sit through. My partner fell asleep during and I left feeling like there was no point to what I just watched. I understand setting up phase 5 but this was a filler at best. Marvel is trying to out Marvel themselves, and it's ending in duds.  Pfeiffer's character is frustrating, the acting was lackluster, Bill Murray was useless and not needed, and the comedy felt forced. Majors was interesting but overall Kang doesn't feel like a threat. The MCU is officially boring, and has been heading that way for a while. The theater was dead after the movie ended, no claps, no oohs and aahs. Skip."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie so much!  Paul Rudd is hilarious and I was constantly laughing.  I would highly recommend it and look forward to watching it again.  I enjoyed the new and old characters throughout the film.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang steals the show as should be but I appreciated the performances from most actors. It can be corny and light when it shouldn't be but it's for all audiences. MODOK made me laugh more than he should have lol. A fun night out that sets up the next phase.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It definitely still had the fun charm the other Antman movies have. What I didn't like was everything felt taken from Star Wars.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly I really loved it, i love everything about it. Especially Cassie's character."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the story line and the graphics was next level.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite critic reviews this was quite an enjoyable film. Not perfect, it has some flaws but that doesn't dominate the overall film. Worth a watch"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was Marvel last chance to save the MCU and they fumbled the bag. Only 25 minutes of the film is tolerable. Terrible movie.#DC Rises.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I really loved kang he was and amazing villain and Paul Rudd was funny as always I thought the the way the went into te realm was a bit forced but i   thought it had a okay story. I also thought it wasted MODOK
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Intresting movie kang really made the movie brtyer and it was very funny i would really recimend this movie to people who like funny,adventure and action movies!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very good movie, incredible scenarios, good story, but the highlight was the villain Kang, although the final fight left a little to be desired, given the strength previously shown by the villain and how he was eventually defeated."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Very fun movie and great effects and visuals. Kang is a great villain so far.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a unexpected surprise! I only watched the first official trailer for this movie and this made it worth while . Between people guessing the plot and getting there hopes up about what is in the movie , seeing the movie for what it is was great . This movie sets the next stage for marvel perfectly, keeping a balance between comedy and suspense while ant man travels down to the quantum realm ."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I like kang too easy to understand good job
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A weak start to the MCU's phase 5. The tone is all over the place, the writing is mid tier at best, the visuals are lack luster as well. Kang the Conqueror was more interesting to me before seeing the movie. Having him introduced in an Ant-Man movie with goofy quips and low stakes really did a disservice to what could have been a great character portrayed by a competent actor. The relationship between Cassie and Scott was the foundation for a lot of the plot but I didn't feel genuine at all. I think I'll wait to see future MCU phase 5 projects until they come to Disney plus."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It sets up Phase 5 perfectly in my opinion and it was a strong, good and funny start for phase 5. Ant-Man is my favourite hero and its my favourite franchise and i think this was the best out of the 3"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantumania feels like it has the scope of a Star Wars film and displays creativity that goes even beyond the Guardians movies. Very entertaining and incredibly imaginative. Definitely the best Ant-Man outing!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"After the mostly lacklustre and disjointed phase 4, I was seriously hoping that phase 5 would kick off with a bang. Sadly my hopes were dashed, when 1 hour into this movie I found myself starting to yawn!

The main cast are great as always, and John Majors as Kang is a perfect choice. But it almost felt like Kangs scenes were filmed in isolation without the other actors being around and then, someone spliced the performances together... This could explain why there doesn't seem to be much chemistry going on. The storyline is also very weak and there is hardly any character development of note.

This makes me sad, I have been a die hard fan  of the MCU since Iron Man 1, and a comic fan for more than 30 years before that. But the movies and TV series seem to be going the way of the comics now, lots of long drawn out storylines that are hard to engage with because there is no one character to root for, as the main focus keeps changing. I miss the old days of comic story telling, where you had a clear beginning, middle and end, and a character or characters going through a crisis that you could root for. I can't read current comics because I don't recognise half of what has gone on before.. And nothing seems to be explained. Just big comic events happen, everything is shaken up, then immediately retconned, so nothing really matters in the life of my favourite heroes.

For me the MCU is going through a similar phase. Disjointed plots, little or no characterisation and no real sense of purpose.
Some of the recent negative comments by big film directors seem to be playing out now. Though at the time I was still hanging on to my love of phases 1 to 3, to want to argue with them about their comments, I'm now starting to sympathise with their views.

The MCU needs to pick up its game, or they are going to lose the loyal fan base of long time Marvelites like myself. I like others will stop watching marvel movies at the cinema, and stop buying blu rays for my collection and will simply watch the stuff online, so as not to waste my time and money.

Dear Kevin Fiege, please bring some quality control back to the MCU. You made some real cinema magic for many years, we're counting on you to restore that magic again!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I am a big MCU fan, and I understand that some movies exist to set up the universe and future movies, but that does not excuse the obligation for this movie to be good as a standalone piece of art. The visuals were beautiful, but the story really fell flat for me. The characters don‚Äôt really learn anything new that wasn‚Äôt covered in the first Ant-Man. The entire movie takes place in the quantum realm, it felt like the beginning of the movie was in such a rush to arrive there. The family dynamic didn‚Äôt feel very believable, at some parts it felt like they had never met before. There are pointless side characters (what a waste of Bill Murray). The action was fun as usual, and it‚Äôs not like Marvel movies are known for being high art (except arguably GOTG 1&2 and maybe the last two avengers movies), but something did just feel off about the characters and the plot. Die hard Marvel fans will certainly enjoy it, but the only impression it left on me was of a generic superhero movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I've found the critical response unfair. Certainly wasn't bored and found the Quantum realm visually interesting. Yes, it drags during the battle scenes, but it's a comic book movie and this needed to evoke scale. No where near as annoying and self satisfied as the last Thor film. However, I do feel that if the Marvel brand is to continue, then after phase 6, the films must become self contained and given free reign not to be beholden to interconnectedness and similar tones."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,I purchased 3D tickets and the showing was actually regular
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really loved it! was it perfect? no, but it was a fun movie!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think my sibling put it best, ""The more you know about the characters the more you will enjoy it."" As probably the biggest Ant-Man fan in the cinema, I can say for certain this is my favourite MCU film by far (I can say for certain after having watched it twice now lol.)

I always thought the other two films lacked in action for Hank and Janet, and them being right in it shows their absolute best qualities. Douglas and Pfieffer seriously killed it. I went from not caring about the MCU's Hank in the first two to absolutely adoring him in this, the ant scene near the end had me grinning from ear to ear!

I haven't read much of Kang before seeing this, but I'm genuinely inspired to pick up a few key issues just to see more! I can say for certain though it was definitely enhanced by Majors' performance.

Scott and Hope were entertaining as usual, yet Cassie was a welcome new hero. Supes excited to see more of her going forward! Fresh as all heck B)"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just the perfect blend of camp, action, humor, very clever script and actually really great acting, Thrilled to see how much screen time Michelle Pfeiffer got, and she owned the scene when she was in frame. Jonathan Majors was awesome beyond what words can express."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"wasnt awful if youre able to suspend your belief enough. the comedy felt subpar and somewhat disappointing. however, the film oscillates frequently between comedy jokes that dont land and captivating dramatic dialogues about the villain.

Jonathan Majors (Kang) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Janet Van Dyne) both are the saving graces to this movie and the only captivating reason to watch. but only enough to make the movie alright."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Much better than the critics have rated it, but I am an MCU fanboy, so WTH do I know?"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,It‚Äôs not as bad as Dr strange or The new Thor..
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great CGI and characters. The introduction of Kang the conqueror was the best. We've seen him without mercy and we got a little back story about him. Learning about the Quantum Realm and what Janet did there was explained perfectly. Paul Rudd( Ant-Man) did a great job in this movie as a protective father who would do anything to save his daughter and the people in need. 
 In my opinion I think this movie deserves 5 stars among all the critics that it gets."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"this movie was poorly scripted, the plot was all over the place, it was very predictable and    it didnt provide the excitement or happiness you acquire when watching a marvel movie or even the previous antmans, i also believed that they jumped right into the quantum universe too soon."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A galera t√° tacando o rate porque o filme tem momentos mais tranquilos, sem muita pancadaria. Assim como foi com Eternos. Ficam achando que todo filme tem que ser um Ultimato. A apresenta√ß√£o do Reino Qu√¢ntico de forma mais detalhada do que o filme anterior e a contextualiza√ß√£o da variante do Kang eram necess√°rios."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is all that I expected in a Marvel Movie!!! It's funny, tons of action, and still keeps the main story together. Critics don't always get it right all the time. This is a fun movie to watch again  & again."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As an overall Marvel universe film, it's very plot heavy due to introducing Kang and providing exposition on past events and what they mean for the future. Action was enjoyable and it was good to see some grit to the combat scenes, very much like Thanos v Hulk in Infinity War.

CG was varied but overall wasn't distracting from the film. Felt that a lot of the background story could have been removed to focus it more on the Lang/Pym family chemistry.

Major's Kang has definitely grounded himself as the next big bad for the next phases of the MCU and I look forward to seeing many more stories (and variants) in the future.

Biggest issue with MODOK was his personality not his CGI. Felt like it was extremely watered down from what we could have had from the character and honestly I feel Darren Cross in AM1 was more of a threat than MODOK in AM3.

As a start to the Multiverse story and Kang, it was fun but it wasn't extremely catching. General movie goers will likely dislike the film, whilst the more die hard MCU fan base will enjoy it much more.

Post credits scenes are some of the best in a long time, and I'm excited to see the story further."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a lot of fun.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the. Storyline - seemed like Star Wars meets Lost World meets TMNT in a Marvel Film. Overall good movie stick around for the ending scenes
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a fun movie. I liked what they did with Kang and looking forward to how this will impact Avengers 5.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is packed with charm, wit, and heart that the predecessors all possessed. Paul Rudd gives us his best performance as Scott Lang thus far, Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer deliver with their respective roles, and Jonathan Majors as KANG? TERRIFYING. Wholly recommend everyone go and see this film, you're sure to have a good time. #KangTrain"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the second best Marvel movie to come out since Endgame
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Come on Marvel! It's just all useless nonsense these days although it is the best one since Endgame. Clearly shot in the volume. Every outdoor scene looked like it was indoors. Every time they were running from danger they were running in a curve because they are on such a small set. Super low budget. The sets were awful. How are all the young women in the mcu super smart geniuses now? How did Cassie get so old? If the blip was five years long then this movie should take place maybe six years after the blip so Cassie should be like 12.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ignore the critic reviews, this is way better than the last antman movie and deserves a better score"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I felt like I was watching a star wars movie
My date said the dialogue was cringe
It seemed like a bit of a hot mess
Marvel hasnt made a good movie since No Way Home"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Good Marvel Movie. Enjoyed the comedy. But the IMAX version is not as good as I expected like Avatar or something but a good Family adventure film.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the bad reviews are really undeserving. Very entertaining, outstanding art direction, the plot help up, great setup for marvel phase 5; really don't understand the hate. I'd give it a solid ‚ÄòB-‚Äò. Far far better that Multiverse of Madness, ETERNALS, or Love & Thunder (though not as funny)."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Seen better movies on the hub 
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Do not listen to the critics. They slammed this movie, because they're looking for something new, or have film criteria then average marvel fan is not looking for.
   Saw it with a group of diverse friends, and all of us agreed it was another fun, well made Marvel film. Admittingly it's no Infinity War or Endgame, but it's not meant to be that. Very creative in its way of portraying the quantum realm, certainly influenced by Star Wars without completely ripping it off. Part to believe this is film 31, and they're still going strong!
   Jonathan Major's is the perfect fit for Kang. The way they introduced him in a more friendly personable manner was awesome, allowing us to get a chance to see his other side rather than being just a villainous conqueror at all times.
  I also loved how they introduced MODOK, and made fun of him him at times, and even having him making fun of himself, seemed like the right approach for such a far out character."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fully enjoyed the movie, I not sure why it's receiving so much hate. I feel people's expectations at this stage are misplaced, it's a new phase, slowly starting the build to the big bad. The film was solid! Ok the storyline could have played out better at the start, but it levelled out. Trust your own eyes, don't go off others opinions."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A ton of fun with a standout villain and a lovely emotional through line.  Every actor is phenomenal, but special praise and mention go to Jonathan Majors, who I can't be more excited to see more of."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I really enjoyed this movie! It works great as both an Ant Man movie and the next chapter of the MCU. Kang was great every time he was onscreen and the interactions between the rest of the Ant-Man team was great to see. The newer side characters were ok but overall the action was great and the visuals were trippy and consistent. I didn't love how much they treated MODOK as a joke but that's a really tough character to make work in live action especially if he isn't given the focus as the main villain.

Would definitely recommend!!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Antman and the Wasp Quantumania is a great film that sets up Phase 5 of the MCU. Fans have been craving for more comic accuracy and this movie delivers on that. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best MCU movie since No Way Home. Compelling, thrilling, quite a nice surprise. Not sure why critics are so negative. SFX are stunning. Go see it!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies of Marvel, don't have a good beginning but the final movie introduce a villain be will the best after Thanos.
Don't better than ""ultimate"" but no one expected this."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie isn't perfect but honestly, it didn't keep me from having a blast watching it. I loved Jonathan Majors as Kang, his acting is amazing. The film was entertaining, it was fun to watch and it made me excited for what's to come in this next phase! +"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Majors gave this movie the shot in the arm that it needed. He is an awesome villain! The writing wasn't Marvel's best but, I'd definitely see it again."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Overall, it feels like humor was ‚ÄòSpliced' into what should have been a dramatic (serious) adventure. The ‚Äòhumor' take seemed out of place, given the setup of Kang as an even bigger threat than Thanos. This should have been a nail biting, dramatic lead out to the next movies. Cliffhanger? Not present. The post-credit scene also failed to impart any sense of ‚Äòimpending doom' . That should have been done in a cliff-hanger scary-ending."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Total must see!  Marvel doesn't disappoint!!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible mix of spy kids and Star Wars, maybe a total of 2 scenes were shot without cgi"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was well paced, has a good story, good interpersonal interactions between the characters, humor without being stupid or juvenile, and a fantastic villain played by a talented actor."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The action , the young father wanting to be with his daughter"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good fun, entertaining and enjoyable!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"An average movie, and a good time at the theater."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great marvel film! Really enjoyed the storyline, CGI of the quantum realm. The best of the Antman trilogy‚Äî bringing together grandparents, parents, and teen daughter into an action/adventure movie"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie with several jaw-dropping moments
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is a lot to take in. I felt the story was rather lazy and predictable. For such a major event in the MCU, I felt it deserved more. However, this film is all about Kang and Johnathan Majors absolutely smashes this. One of the best performances from within the MCU in my opinion. Can't wait to see more of him. I felt the script let Cassie down, very cliche and cheesy moments when the film was trying to deliver serious points. I felt the humour in general was there however, which kept the tone from the previous Ant Man films. 
Unsurprisingly, there is a lot of CGI. This was expected, as near enough the entire film is set within the Quantum Realm. I think you have to embrace the wackiness, not critisize it. Overall, I feel it's a film or strong performances but a weak story - it's Johnathan Majors film."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel meets Star Wars meets Rick and Morty. 
An average plus movie, the plot is a bit messy but it sets up the phase's theme pretty well"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was an amazing experience in the cimena, I really enjoyed it!!! Plot was pretty damn good as well as credit and post credit scenes, but ending could be much better imo."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The best MCU movie since Guardians of the Galaxy
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I totally enjoyed this movie. So did my family . IMO it's been one of the better movies of the MCU in the last couple of years. A visual treat if you consider the hugeness of the microscopic quantum realm they traversed and it had a story arc that opens up so many possibilities for the MCU with all the versions of Kang the Conqueror as the next Thanos.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great trippy fun superhero film
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not good, not bad, just meh"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good entry into the MCU and a nice launch for Phase 5.  Kang is a great villain, sets up the next saga nicely.  Grimmer than the first two Ant-Man movies, not as much humor as they had.  Definitely recommend it."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a fun, pulpy adventure through the quantum realm. Don't listen to the critics. I guess they were expecting an art film. That is definitely not what this is. This film is more like the classic Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon comics, featuring amazing, fantastical places and weird and diverse creatures and people.

This is a very creative, imaginative, entertaining, and funny film, and, at just over two hours, it doesn't overstay its welcome. It also introduces the next big bad in the MCU, so, even if you're not into Ant-Man, you'll want to watch this film, if you're into Marvel at all."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"the movie was really good. best marvel movie in years, alot of M-She-U but it was still very good"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know why people have rated it as low as they have. It had everything! Awaiting to see it again on OTT!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's definitely a good lead in to phase 6.  Brings in certain characters to keep the mulitverse going.  explains a lot and leaves things open for other elements of Marvel and allows a vast number of possibilities.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Masterpiece! Excited to what‚Äôs coming. #KANG
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it. Something different but Kang was awesome!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Critics might be overcorrecting and reviewing it based on fatigue  and other previous easy grading. its Not the best. Not the worst MCU. But it was fun(ish)...It needed to trim a verse and spend a little more time on others to really land the plane.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's so good that I want to see it again.  Puts marvel films back on track. üëè
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,um filme bom mas n√£o mostrou toda essa impon√™ncia do kang
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was a bit too fast-paced and was bland for what was supposed to be an ""avengers-level movie"", MODOK was also kind of a wasted character used for gags"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked how it had a good mix of comedy and action!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie as a whole and was entertained.  As much as I wanted to see more of the Quantum Realm and the new characters that inhabited it, I'm glad the runtime was just over two hours as it felt right for the pace of the story.  They balanced the humor, tone, and lightheartedness that the Scott Lang character brings to the MCU vs the serious/danger aspects of Kang very well and did a great job ratcheting up the tension/threat level of Kang as the next big bad. As with most Marvel movies, there are 2 stinger scenes in the credits, both of which capped off the movie well and tied to upcoming MCU releases, whetting your appetite for what's next.  While I understand that the Scott/Cassie storyline was an important part of this story, I would have enjoyed seeing just a little bit more of the Scott/Hope chemistry that was established in the previous films as this would have helped add more impact to scenes toward the end of the film.  I saw the film in IMAX 3D (stunning!) and will probably see it again in regular 2D to compare."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"While not amazing, the story was decent and the visuals were awesome. I would see it again for fun in theaters. Critics really confused me here."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don‚Äôt believe rotten tomatoes, this movie was great, with awesome effects!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Kang is dope af! Can't wait to see where the MCU is headed.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, the pacing was a bit off at the start but picked up towards the end."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania is the opening hand for Phase 5 and is truly a visionary wonder to behold. This third installment in the Ant-Man franchise is loaded with a bunch of things viewers might like in regard to action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in recent Marvel productions. It really has done a great job of setting up and entertaining to the point that there is a lot still uncover. Some good character use, a hint of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters are good foundations. Majors is a welcome addition, especially with what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. The movie still has balance issues, mainly in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not trying to do too much. There is still plenty that they accomplished, but I think more time or less content would have helped with character usage and action."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The urge for every Marvel to be equal to Endgame and NWH is stupid. This definitely is not a 47% RT movie,i liked it and can say deserves more than 70% score. Good Start to Phase 5 and waiting for more Kang Variantsüî•üî•"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Coming from a person who loved 1 and 2, this movie misses the mark on multiple levels."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was better then everything in phase 4 except for spiderman and shang Chi. I left  the movies with more faith in marvel. That was a big surprise after the terrible thor movie
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have low expectations for Marvel movies. That's a fact. As a 50 yr old comic book fan, who can't stand most or the recent hogwash Disney has been putting out. This was fun and entertaining. Visuals were awesome enough for me to want to see it again in 3d. A good comic book movie, terrible if you have a woke check box sheet you use to rate films."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had a fun time. Ignore the critics, if you are a Marvel fan you are going to love Kang and the teases offered at the end."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Story Line! Outstanding Special Effects! A Great Ride!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was great, had great cgi , It set up Kang really well , the whole quantum realm was really cool, I liked the story , I don't see what those critics are seeing, I think it's become like a fad popular thing to poo on the marvel movies and shows at the moment, I personally only didn't like she hulk and eternals and black panther 2 had some silly moments but wasn't a bad film.

I think this was better than black panther 2 and definitely eternals. 
I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jonathan Majors was great. Wasn't fully connected with the crisis in the quantum realm but was very interesting and a positive set up for the next chapter. Needed Luis!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Faltou enterro, estrega do est√∫dio para fazer um bom filme, novamente as senas p√≥s cr√©ditos salvaram o filme..."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable, but had some significant issues. The entire movie could have been avoided simply by characters talking instead of making vague statements for the first 40 minutes. Marvel once again relies on the massive revolution battle scene to try and install some excitement into the climax. Kang was great, other villain was a literally joke. The final battle was a complete mess sending your mind into what the ramifications of the story will be, only to solve that issue a moment later multiple times.
I had fun, but it wasn't a great movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great, but it could be perfect if the movie was centered on scott and hope and not just kang. The movie could be better for me if the first 15 minutes we could see luis or a scene more intense with the relationship with the characters, such as Scott, hope and their daughter"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Com muito esfor√ßo o filme √© um nota 5,5 de 10. Nada mais"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Overall it was decent. The effects were great and it was an interesting snippet into the world and the actors were good in their respective roles however it felt like the movie only scratched the surface in terms of what it explored in both the world and character dynamics (especially Hope Van Dyne).
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great film , wants to be a gateway to to many films and focuses that at some points more than just being a good film on its own .At some points the film can be a little lacklustre but all in all a solid superhero flick"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie has a lot of inconsistencies
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than Thor: Love and Thunder, better than Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness. Ant-man stayed true to being the comic that is himself and best introduced the next phase of Marvel."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! Love that it was in 3D. New stars made the movie plot great. Exciting to watch and enjoyed the plot line. Highly recommend.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Kept my interest for the 2 hours.  Basic good against evil theme. Enjoyed it
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great   . Marvel delivers yet again!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Typical Marvel movie, it sets up the next phase of films well and overall is an enjoyable watch. It isn't going to exercise the grey matter much, but is an enjoyable bit of no brainer popcorn fun."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great way to end off the antman trilogy and to introduce Kang. Top 5 villains in the MCU. Even better the second time watching
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gotta laugh at the critics reviews of this marvelously entertaining movie. Marvel keeps surprising me, every time I figure they've run through all the success they can have they come out with something wonderful."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In Avengers 5 just call an army of bees to win, you don't even need the Avengers. The MCU's Kang is weak..."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Most enjoyable superhero movie. On par with Thor Love and Thunder. Solid villain. This third Ant Man film is better than the second. 

Now if you are some kind of Incell Biscuithead , then nothing in life will make you set aside your loathing of  the strong female heroine characters found in this movie. This film is not for you.

Everyone else who actually like superhero movies. Youll like this one."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I was a little worried going in due to critics reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. I had a great time. Is it Winter Soldier good?  Not really but it's fun and entertaining. Jonathon Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer being standouts. Do recommend.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Always love Ant man, it was good but not as good as I expected"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's not as bad as the critics say. It's just.. meh. Jonathan majors is a standout.  Modok I thought actually looked Decent.  I just wished disney did something different instead of the same exact formula.  Guardians will probably be the last marvel movie I goto the cinema for. Everything they bring out is just terrible.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie well though out. great plot.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the twists and turns of the plot
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally getting Phase 5 going. So much fun
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's not a bad movie 
And it's not the worst movie ever 
I'd recommend it"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Over all a great introduction to kang even if he was only using 15% of his power due to the quantum realm
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining.  Not the best marvel movie. But still better then
 Black Panther"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Do not listen to the critics, see it for yourself! Kang is the real deal."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a MCU diehard from 2008 and can honestly say that I believe we are witnessing its decline. Kang is literally the only reason to see this movie. The jokes are stale and for such high stakes there shouldn't be 5 mins dedicated to üï≥Ô∏è holes! The first hr literally was putting me to sleep. Johnathan Majors did what he could do but the script is juvenile, the effects were mediocre compared to Avatar and the MCU formula is becoming bland. I'm sorry but I'll wait for GOTG3 and The Marvels to stream on Disney Plus. 



Ps I'm also a Disney Stock Holder!

Correct this sinking ship Iger!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Really fun movie. Majors performance was really good
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Really felt like a Marvel and Star wars movie collided. The film felt like it never actually got going. Very messy and weak. The inner dialogue scenes were awful. The multiple family members and soppy plot is a let down. No actually focus on a main character. Kang is cast amazing. The last end credit scene was better than the whole movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it was a great introduction for Kang but i hope it gets alot better
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The film is beautiful in every way. True fans will appreciate it. The old critics who whine that this is a bad movie are wrong. I watched 2 times. I'll go one more time. Thanks Marvel.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie, hay vcl hay"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A segunda apari√ß√£o de Jonathan Majors no MCU como Kang: O Conquistador √© repleta de aventura e a√ß√£o na medida certa, a com√©dia de MODOK em sua maioria √© destoante do restante do filme, mas sem nunca deixar o ritmo dele cair. N√£o √© o melhor cap√≠tulo da Marvel mas est√° longe de ser o que a cr√≠tica fomentada por clickbait anda alargando"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was funny, well organized. Makes me miss the original cast. I wish all the original  marvel cast member can make these movies forever!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Meh. Not terrible, but not as good as I hoped it would be. Didn't like Casey, MODOK, the lack of humour, how poor the sparse bits of humour actually were, and Hope's hair - WTF was she thinking? The setting was also just too ""otherworldy"" to be taken seriously.
Did like Rudd, Kang, the end credit scene, and it was great to see Hank get his moment of glory."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Ant-Man movie so far
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sigh...I hope I'm not getting tired of these things.  it was good, but I really don't see it coming together like the first set of phases leading up to Avengers Endgame."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a good movie to watch I like how marvel is making a New big  bad villain for this franchise and how they are making Kang the conqueror little bit more difficult to beat
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! I think people have come to expect every Marcel product to be equal to End Game. End   Game was built on 10 years of content. 

Enjoy the movie for the story telling and don't expect every movie to contain everything you want. Years and years of content can't be put into a 3 hour movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent. Exactly what fans need. Great adventure, solid connections with MCU. Not too much jokes. Beautiful photography."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it! I went into it with the right mindset/expectations, and I thought it was really good. Paul Rudd plays his character so well. Jonathan Majors was great. He makes the character terrifying. The movie does a great job setting him up and telling the story and laying the foundation for what's to come in the MCU!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Really boring and terrible story,all the humor   and excitement is gone. It feels more like a DC movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Antman movie.  Solid must watch Marvel movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I feel like people have forgotten that Marvel movies were never god teir cinema. They were always in that, ""Good, not great"" space. From my perspective, I went in expecting another fun, sci/fi, action movie, with a cute family subplot, and thats exactly what I got. So based on your expectations for this film, your mileage may vary. From where I'm standing, this movie is about on par with Thor: Ragnarok and The First Avenger. I enjoyed the quirky comedy that has been present throughout all the Ant-Man films. Yes, this is bigger in scale than the other two that preceded it, but as the conclusion to the trilogy, our introduction to Phase five and the continuation of the Kang storyline, it makes sense. The world and creature designs are inventive and well-realized. Yes, the same overly busy production desing, and overuse of CGI is present here, just like every other Marvel movie since Age of Ultron. There are a couple tired Marvel tropes in there, not all the comedy lands, and the tone is a bit messy. But, none of that breaks the movie. Its good. Most people who go to see this movie will enjoy it, as indicated by the audience score, and the Cinemascore. I enjoyed it a lot and I'm basically sold on Kang as a villain in the upcoming Avengers movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Comedy and action packed fun. In line with the other ant man movies in tone. Amazing visuals and some great heart felt moments. My favorite of the trilogy. The villain was amazing!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The quantum realm was shown with a lot of detail.  Shown was a lot different types of life that are friendly and some terrifying. 
Lots of action sequences and of course lots of plots complication.  Could have had more laughs, but this is seriously weird world, that would freak out most .  Two sneak peeks, one after main ending titles and one at the very end."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was the movie perfect? No. Were there things I would have done different. Yes? However, is it as bad as the critics are saying it is? Absolutely not. Jonathan majors is a force as Kong and a perfect choice to the MCU as the next big bad."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its a popcorn flick. Sure it has its problems but hey everyone in the theater when i watched was laughing and cheering, what more can I say?

All The Kang variants are menacing!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The hate its getting is illogical fight scenes to cgi are great go for it
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The graphics were so amazing. Overall would recommend to all. Also, if you don‚Äôt stay for the post credits, then you‚Äôre not a real fan."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just wasn't impressed, whole movie could have been avoided had the family had one 20 minute conversation about the quantum realm."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Some people do not like setup movies.  I can see where they are trying to take this for the next phase and am excited for the rest of the movies.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely LOVED this movie. Critics are so self-important and think they can do better than executive producers (despite critics never ever making a movie themselves). Don't listen to critics! I'm going to see it a second time today. Johnathan Majors was excellent in this. He was the best actor in the entire film. The CGI looks good and the character designs were VERY imaginative. Very inspirational future technology was there. They didn't have a lot of AI references but actual advanced hardware like neuro-kinetic control of devices, etc. This was a fascinating exploration in speculative design and future oriented engineer. Which is something I loved as a full time engineer and part time inventor.

The largest issue is understandable. They tried to make a PG 13 family movie and introduce the next major story arch. So understandably the movie is extremely safe and the tone is  a little mis-matched. Largely MODOK, Cassie's speaking lines, and Paul Rudd's lines were much like previous Ant man movies (childlike humor) but Johnathan Major's lines more of Phase 5 Arch-villain. They made a business choice and I understand that. I'm assuming Ant man's movies bring in a lot of kids. Again, I understand Marvel is a business."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man And The Wasp Quantumania is a good, although very flawed movie. Kang the Conqueror is an amazing addition to the film and Jonathon Majors gives and amazing performance to back it up. 

Paul Rudd is as charming as ever and this movie continues to show why he's a personal favourite Avenger. 

However where this movie loses a lot of what could've made it great is the introduction of MODOK. While funny at times, MODOK ruins the sense of urgency that Kang brings, which you would think Marvel would not want to do since this is his big introduction.

The visuals are also all over the place and can range from top notch MCU to the very worst CGI the MCU has to offer. 

Overall I'd go positive on this film and if you're a fan of Ant-Man or the MCU I'd recommend you'd check it out."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, critics must all have sticks up their butts."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the best marvel movie since endgame. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE HATERS?!?!?!

Ite fun, epic, emotional, suspenseful, goofy, well acted. The Ant man family of cassie, hank, the wasp and everyone is an absolute blast. 

10/10 film. Do not hesitate to book your tickets"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't understand the bad reviews. It's a new Phase with new stakes/ concepts and a new big bad. There's gonna be some world building. Marvel movies are basically episodes in a theater series.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was ok, Defintely not the legendary beginning to phase 5 everyone wanted but its what we got. Still not as bad as love and thunder though. Its worth seeing it at the movies."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great don't listen to the critics!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"To find out more about kang was cool however if this is the movie to kick off phase 5, it's pretty weak."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,this movie was terrible marvel has lost its magic no wonder why Kevin feige is leaving marvel.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was good.  A little cheesy.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and action packed!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie was not disappointed
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,A weak script cloaked in Avatar wannabe FX. Relies on pandering to a fan base that gleefully embraces the tired tropes. Continues the descending trajectory of Marvel output. 
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Standard plot. Underwhelming villain, or should I say underdeveloped villain motivation. Unfortunate lack of depth"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Antman movie and great introduction/transition to the next phase. Leaves some questions to be answered still, which is good imo."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The beginning was somewhat boring because the movie acts like the audience doesn't know that Kang is the bad guy. Apart from Janet, I found all the characters to be enjoyable. Cassie Lang comes into her own and MODOK is a fun surprise. This is weaker as MCU entries go, but it is still enjoyable for what it is."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this movie was great. Of course it's not going to be Infinity War or Endgame level but it was definitely not bad. I don't understand why people are hating on it so much. I really enjoyed it!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie and a leap into the Quantum you won't regret. Ant-man never let's the audience down.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Bom filme apesar das cr√≠ticas pesadas
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics have lost their damn mind. This movie was excellent. Definitely one of the better releases from Marvel lately.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie. I love Paul Rudd and his gentle humor. However, the stand out was Jonathan Majors as the villain. In general the movie was fun to watch and provided a needed break."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Flat with little character development. Kang is defeated by ants and a big dude. Pfft.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a pretty solid movie. Kant is a great villain and comedy was good.  They kept all of the wokeness away.  10x better than Wakanda Forever.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Another Marvel movie full of action, little story telling. Am I awake yet?  Longing for the days of real movies like from Clint Eastwood, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I felt like we had the old Marvel magic back!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was okay. I wouldnt see it again, though."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"See it in 3D. Jonathan Majors is amazing. 

Be prepared - MODOK is a WEIRD character, and if you're familiar with Rick and Morty know this - All of the weird stuff about Rick is a direct ripoff of Kang from Marvel. I laughed a lot, but I laugh at Rick and Morty. Still - These characters are drawn straight from the Marvel comics of generations bygone, even paying homage to the predecessor of Marvel comics. MODOK is extremely powerful in the comics, and I think that one bit of insider Marvel fan knowledge was helpful for my enjoyment.

Michelle Pfeiffer and whoever did ladies stunts were great. The animated characters were top notch. Scott Lang's last monologue is a great moment for Paul Rudd, and about right with how the human brain operates. Sign me up for the reign of #KangDynasty."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"No se en que se basan los ""criticos"" pero la pelicula es buena, tiene una historia bien contada, buenas actuaci√≥n y el desarrollo de kang es genial, el le da el plus que la pelicula necesitaba."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Majors was over acting, like a play actor and not for cinema; he was not a Thanos at all, and we have more movies with him ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü´É. There were lines where ant man's daughter sounded like The Falcon and Winter Soldier Captain America's season finale ending monologue, telling Modoc ‚ÄòYou're a dick."" The third act was no End Game because Marvel failed to sprinkle Easter Eggs during phase 4 that would tie this movie to phase 4. Easter eggs would have made this act more emotional, exciting, and suspenseful. Also, if someone dies, do you even care about their death if this is the first time you meet them? This movie reminds me of that third act in Star Wars episode 7, or was it episode 8, the big battle. I don't remember which Star Wars it was and I don't care to go back to find out. Oh, and Murdock, what a travesty. Murdoc was awesome in the cartoons, so I'm disappointed with Marvel for what they did here - making Murdoc a punchline. Marvel needs a new show runner like Nerdrotic. #MarvelHireNerdrotic #AntManAndTheWasp¬†¬†¬† #AntMan3 @Nerdrotics follow me on Twitter @aroadtoabillion"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was awesome. I just wouldve liked to see Scotts crew involved a little more. Maybe trying to find them or sending signals to try to find them. Etc. other than that, must see."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dragged on until it was time to close the story but then felt jammed last minute. Kang was done dirty by plot writers too.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Acting was superb in this thrilling throwback to classic science fiction epics! And even for a MCU movie, the post credits scenes have me excited for the future!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's a good cliche' family movie in the realm of ""Journey to the Center of the earth"" meets ""Honey, I shrunk the kids""."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. It's a self contained chapter to the bigger story that Phase 4 began to set up.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is a solid MCU movie.  Ignore the critics' score.  If you liked any of the Antman movies you will like this movie a lot.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of the most funny and best Movies ever from marvel. Recommend it!!
KANG WAS AWSOME!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,its was good i was better than antman and the wasp not as good as the first on on my opinion. ots family friendly and bill Murray makes a cameo but if your not in to the new marvel formula dont bother watching it i do have to say im glad it wasn't pushing identity politics tho there's a part where they were pushing socialism as a good thing... i dont believe that line was needed in a fantasy movie
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,M.O.D.O.K. was awful but otherwise it was a fun movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie, it moves fast and the comedy is on point. I understand the critics point of view, but as a third episode of a franchise, this movie is for the fans. Is true you will be a little lost if you haven't seen any MCU movie before this one, but why would you start with this one?"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Its a great movie to watch I'd recommended it to you all!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie for a fun time
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's a fun mess, but nonetheless a squished ant of a mess. It suffers from the same problems ""Thor: Love & Thunder"" had: 1. Too short. 2. Tonal shifts. 3. Underdeveloped characters. 4. Too much focus on world-building and getting to the next set of movies and TV shows. 5. A compelling villain undone by strange choices. 6. A very dumb, poorly-executed and written decision (more on that later). 

And carries over the plot-conveniences ""Wakanda Forever"" had. 

Maybe I'm expecting more out of this movies and TV shows from Marvel Studios, but this is certainly a step back versus a giant Ant-Man-sized leap forward."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was great. Good acting, lots of fun. Shocking moments. Marvel is always breaking new ground."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It wasn't very exciting.  95% of the movie is in the ""Quantum Realm"" - computer generated.  My son and I left unimpressed and we really like the Marvel movies."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely terrible, it feels like it was written by a group of middle schoolers. Nothing in this movie makes the slightest bit of sense. The third act was ... I don't even have the words to describe how ridiculous the third act was. I know ""ridiculous"" is part of the whole Ant-Man movie theme, but this was reaching beyond and into dumb. The change in pacing and tone throughout were jarring. Cassie's character's whole vibe was 100% annoying. This movie is, sadly, so bad that I wish I could unsee it. It is in my bottom five MCU films. I cannot stress enough how bad this movie is. Why was Bill Murray in this movie? He added nothing to the plot or story. His character didn't even provide exposition to advance the plot or story. Kang's powers were inconsistent. One minute he's seemingly unstoppable and the next he's struggling to deal with threats that should've been easy to dismiss. I sighed through the entire final fight and was, by that time, just ready for the whole thing to end."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Im glad I went in with no expectations. This movie is really terrible. Paul Rudd is always great and he saved the movie. Jonathan Majors is awesome but not in the movie enough. I probably checked my watch at least 4 times. Thats a bad sign. The saving grace is that it is only 2 hours long.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Sicuramente non √® il film Marvel migliore, ma offre l'intrattenimento giusto per un film di azione. 
Dopo aver passato numerosi film con CGI veramente scadente, finalmente Marvel ci da un film con grande spettacolo da quel punto di vista: gli effetti visivi sono sicuramente il punto forte del film.
Altro punto sicuramente a favore √® la prova attoriale di Rudd che, nonostante non sia supportato dalla sceneggiatura degli scorsi due film, da il meglio con il suo ottimo umorismo. Si nota in modo molto evidente che la sceneggiatura non √® stata scritta anche dall'attore protagonista. 
Al contrario la trama √® troppo veloce e sorvola sopra troppi dettagli: la confusione intorno alle origini di Kang non √® poca e per capirla √® necessario sforzarsi e collegare i puntini da soli. 
Altrettanto deludente √® il personaggio di Cassie che non riesce a essere il cuore del film come dovrebbe essere secondo le intenzioni della trama. 
Comunque √® un film vedibile e che introduce Kang, interpretato da un ottimo Jonathan Majors, per le prossime due fasi del MCU."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"By far the best Ant-Man movie, this was a fantastic way to start Phase 5"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it was great more of the older Marvel movies formula without going into the comedic mess of Thor Love and Thunder. Kang was awesomeness! Felt a little Star Wars but in a good way. Loved it.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It wasnt as good as i was expecting but it wasnt that bad either, the cast is great together and the story wasnt too bad, ill have to watch again to see if i missed anything. still going in the collection"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed Quantamania. Loved Kang, enjoyed the Quantam Realm and its characters, story was fine, mid and post credits were great! A good Marvel movie! I had a really good time and the whole theater seemed to really enjoy the movie. 

9/10"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics couldn't be more wrong with their shade on this movie. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. The creatures, tech and all aspects of the quantum realm were imaginative and visually captivating. The story made sense for the most part (all movies have a few holes). The actors are great ‚Ä¶again. Lots of laughs and fun. Expectations have gotten way out of wack. Dear Marvel, please bring the Bill Murray and Jeff Goldblum characters together somehow."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a fun movie with some big implications for the Mcu honesty best movie since no way home
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't know what to say about this movie.. it was all right according to marvels recent traumatizing failures (Thor: Love and Thunder, She- Hulk, Morbius etc.) Although for the most part it just felt as though ""Spy Kids 3D"" and ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" had a baby with down syndrome. 

It felt as though every actor except Johnathan Majors were reading their lines off of a wall. They're performances were so bland. But in my honest opinion. Johnathan Majors portrayed his villain beautifully. Kang will go down as a really good MCU villain. 

This film is also directed by Peyton Reed, so obviously, the camera work is lame, bland shot reverse shot style, and unappealing to the fucking eye. Disgusting.

The only thing which kept me going was the amount of times I laughed in this movie (it can be counted on one hand) Only the scene where faintly in the background a possibility of Scott asks the ice cream guy ""Can I get some ice cream"" was the funniest thing and surprisingly my cinema didn't react to it. I don't know how the messed up the CGI so bad. I'm not even going to point out how bad M.O.D.O.K looked... Laughably bad.

Anyways the overall plot was decent but this movie kinda ruined a trend in marvel movies. In the third movie the main character usually loses something. Iron Man lost his suits. Cap lost his shield. Thor lost his hammer. Spider-Man lost his fucking identity. And in Infinity War they lost half the universe. Would've been better if they killed off Janet and made Scott and Hope have a tear in their relationship. 

But a really unique thing I noticed which I have never ever seen in my time in films is the drink which gives them the ability to understand the aliens. By the way, this was just paving the way for so many of these aliens to make a cameo in some Guardians movie. Ant fight scene was really well done in my opinion.

Marvel semi-blundered this time."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the first Ant Man I saw in theaters and I really enjoyed the movie. Enjoyed all the Kang scenes and love the set up for future Kang appearances
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,I recommend the movie it‚Äôs very entertaining. It‚Äôs a good movie for setting up future movies and shows like Loki season 2 and potentially avengers 5 the kang dinasty
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The family and I really enjoyed this movie.  It‚Äôs a sci fi adventure with a Star Wars vibe to it.  And everything in the Quantum Realm was great, and I am definitely looking forward to what‚Äôs next in phase 5."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very meh, Messy plot & character shifts with ""just because"" explanation. Modok CGI was uncomfortable to look at. Some funny moments. Rudd, Majors, and Pheiffer were highlights but the script focused more on showcasing the cgi & the quantum realm and not their characters. Won't rewatch this one. It was fine but a let down from previous films"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'll be the 1st to acknowledge the last couple Marvel films have been less than hoped for. That ended with this movie. I had little to no expectations going into it, but as I sat there with my daughters, seeing their laughter, watching them become engaged. It reminded me how much fun watching these movies can be. This movie is on the shorter side for a Marvel movie, but it appears that's what they are doing lately. But it doesn't waste time getting you involved at all. It felt like a full movie, filled with new characters, incredible effects ( calm your chee chees James Cameron ), solid emotion, and above all a new big bad who nails his role perfectly. Screw critics! And there over confident opinions. This movie was great from start to finish."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I was disappointed that once again an MCU film stands alone. I find the best part of the MCU is the unique way everything fits together, and that has not seemed possible in the last few years. How can several series and a few movies mention the fact that there are still millions of homeless due to the blip and have the others not mention it all? And is the new Captain America doing ANYTHING at all in this world? Why didn't Cassie mention him changing international law to help?"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are capping on this one,  this movie is absolutely solid, was funny while not overdoing the jokes, and had a great story and characters. This movie was better than all of phase 4 outside of Spiderman."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It‚Äôs crazy, to me, how 31 films in everyone is so hyper critical of these movies now. I love how Scott‚Äôs arc played out with Cassie. Jonathan Majors portrayal as Kang was award worthy. I love that Hank and Hope helped to rescue Scott and save the day."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ich habe den Film gestern in einem IMAX Kino gesehen. In dem Kino empfand ich die Animation OK. Die Story hat ein paar L√ºcken und wirft manchmal Fragen auf. Vieles im Film war aber sehr √ºberraschend und cool zu sehen, wie Marvel das umgesetzt hat. Nach dem Film f√ºhlt es sich endlich so an, zu wissen wo die Reise hin gehen soll."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"As usual people either take films too seriously or get mad because you enjoy something they don't. It's a great film, very funny, the visuals are spectacular and Kang is regal, insane, powerful and frightening simultaneously. I'm excited to see what else is to come and I'm looking forward to my favorite villain finally on the big screen as opposed to the comics."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid movie and possibly the best of the Ant-Man series.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Paul Rudd is charming and it's nice seeing a Marvel movie with a main character without a sad back story. Overall it's a silly movie with lots of quirky jokes and pretty goofy and overmatched villains. It's fun seeing a quantum world that's pretty goofy, but it does feel very small and familiar. Almost like it's all just one big city and flat backdrop without much purpose other than to provide the setting for the heroes. Jonathan Majors is strong as Kang and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer) has enjoyable scenes.  The real foil is a formulaic plot structure of a very familiar hero's journey and standard marvel set-up of bad guys doing bad things, good guys fighting back, bad guys grabbing a random temporary upper hand, then good guys immediately regaining the upper hand through ex machina. It's not inherently bad, but repetitive in MCU. In the end it's sort of a Spaceballs meets Marvel. It passes the time but there aren't any memorable scenes you'll likely want to revisit and it likely won't leave you feeling much other than acknowledgment that you've kept up with Marvel's most recent homework assignment. Overall a fine kids movie that probably isn't meant to deliver much substance to adults."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too much CGI, lack of humor, and a totally unrelatable story. Definitely the worst Marvel movie to date."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"My 12 year-old daughter and I absolutely loved this movie! The quantum realm was outrageously fun and imaginative, and Kang brought a level of villain that has only been matched in the MCU by Thanos in Infinity War.

I'm not sure why the critics are so hard on this movie, unless they're upset that your enjoyment of the film may depend on how familiar you are with MCU material (Loki!!). As a comic reader as a kid and an MCU fan since the beginning, I loved absolutely everything about Quantamania!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film does just what you want in an Ant-Man film, only bigger. 3D is usually a crapshoot for me, but the Quantum Realm was made for it. Maybe it doesn't have the emotional weight of an Endgame, but the Ant-Man films are made of lighter stuff, and that suits me fine. Also, Michelle Pfeiffer unexpectedly steals the show as a sort of John Carter of Mars for the QR. John Majors is terrific, giving us a wide-ranging, charismatic performance of a bad guy who you could see yourself getting seduced by. Very excited to see where Kang goes next in the MCU."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This was probably the best ant man movie that we have gotten so far in my opinion 
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Don't pay attention to the critic reviews on this one. It was great fun. It wasn't perfect and there are things I would have like to seen done differently. Kang was great and I look forward to seeing more of him.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Yeah Loveness can‚Äôt write.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The graphics are definitely the only thing positive at all about this flick.
Perhaps if I had watched the previous versions of "" the Quantum "" , that knowledge might have made this 2023 version more understandable."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was darker than other ant-man movies, but was imaginative and had a cohesive story. It also sets the spark the future for marvel TV and movies. I found myself wondering as I watched whether critics had seen the same movie. This was clearly a superior movie to Thor Dark World, for example."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very enjoyable film. I definitely have my issues with the way that certain characters were flushed out, however it is still a fine edition to the grand MCU."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this chapter of Ant-Man.Paul Rudd took this character to another level. When he appeared in Captain America's ""Civil War"" I did not care for his role or costume. But after watching the 2 previous movies, it made sense to the comical approach he did in those films. They were really good movies. The love for his daughter means everything to him. It pays off. 
 Kang Bi-Polar antic makes me wonder about the Multiverse and if he really has power to conquer it.  The variants of him killed 2 times . Enjoy this movies make sure you connect with Disney plus to watch how the Kang Dynasty  starts on Loki the series."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its a good Marvel movie with good characters and one of the best and threatening villians in the mcu all time. Sometimes the CGI looks bad but its definitely not a bad movie, Thor Love and Thunder is a bad movie"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Huge lifetime Marvel fan not very impressed 
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,One of my favorite marvel films to date! Great way to start phase 5 with Kang.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Painfully average film
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film is passable to a certain point that the performance of the actors I felt was very random but the performance that I did carry out very well was the one played by Kan the conqueror that I really liked and it was that I carried the weight of the movie, but The effects of the film are very bad, and it is also very taken to a green screen that is very poorly implemented in the direction and above all that its director does not care what goes well or badly his film is something aberrational of him as an adult that he think like that, and it disgusts me to see it anyway, it's my mere opinion, thanks"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Plenty of action, adventure & laughs. Family friendly besides a few ‚Äúsh*t‚Äù‚Äôs. Overall solid movie and would like to see again"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lamentav√©l, como est√° sendo essa nova fase da Marvel. Embora esteja dando lucro, n√£o ser√° uma obra que o publico ver√° mais de uma vez.

"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant man and The Wasp Quantumania delivers in terms of action, fun, and story. While very different from his previous adventures, this movie works. The story is focused on Janet and Kang while Scott is the one that pushes the plot. This movie is a perfect bridge for what's to come in the future of the MCU."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just don't know what the critics are on. Amazing 
Movie"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie took the MCU in some interesting directions. Some of the Quantum Realm was a little over the top, but I enjoyed the story and family interaction. Go see this movie if you just want to have a good time in the theater."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was good,  Jonathan Majors was legendary"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, an adventure movie with stunning visuals and great pacing, I dont know who paid the critics to dislike it so much. I will be going back to see it again with a couple edibles in my system. All and all this is a comic book movie and it plays as such I Would reccomend you see this movie for yourself and dont let people poke holes in it, just enjoy the ride."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed it. Excellent special effects, great storyline, brilliant introduction of Kang the Conqueror to the MCU plus enough humour to keep the chuckles going without being too cheesy."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The start of the movie went by fast. The build up of the quatemrealm felt like it was just another spot they have been to.. The main Villain was a true Villain that is something I will say this movie did a great job at. Everything else seems like there was no consequence or just joked off. Modok was a right hand joke instead of a right hand man. Not the best way to start off phase 5.

One thing I'll say is I never got bored of the movie personally. That is why I don't think this is bad or a great movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was overall good. It had little moments that would make one get bored and get distracted. But the whole movie had everything: reasoning, great battles, and amazing acting. Thus,  I gave Antman and the Wasp Quantimanium a 4/5"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a very dignified phase 5 opening even though there are a few issues with the story.  The story itself, although there are some good points, but the story is not as wow as it should be. The most wow story is the story of a parallel universe, just that. Others are not quite wow.  The action scenes are also very well done. It's very fun as the Ant-Man sector where the action scenes are extremely fun.  The villain in the movie is considered brutal and very scary. It is one of our favorite villains.  Drama scenes or comedy scenes are still considered to be a good standard.  Another part that I admire is the visual work in the movie, which is very beautiful.  And the last thing to mention is the end credits scene that says it all."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall great movie, there are a few convinient plotholes here and there, but if you just want a nice movie experience watch this.
Rated at 4 but everyone says its bad so im gonna give 5"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania serves as an introduction to Marvel Phase 5, providing an entertaining and fun-filled experience for fans. While it's not the best of the Marvel films, the addition of Kang and returning characters make it worth watching"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are wrong.  It's a fun movie and a good movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was exactly what I expected and more. Majors as Kang was incredible, his introduction into the MCU was exciting and left me waiting for more of Kang! Ant man was funny and lighthearted, yet serious when it comes to his family."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was good 1 time watch unfortunately I but could not build the connection there was no excitement after watching this movie as marvel traditional Marvel movie use to get chills and you stand out of the seat
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it!! Huge Marvel fan, but wasn't expecting to love it as much as we did! Great movie to escape to and Jonathan Majors as Kang stole every scene he was in!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Been one of the better Marvel movies of late.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sometimes when you see a movie and it doesn't live up to your expectations, it still feels like a movie and you get to enjoy the experience. However, Quantumania didn't even have that. It was devoid of life and I felt compelled to just walk out of the theater. I'm just so disappointed with Kevin Feige."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was unique in comparison to other Marvel movies. In recent movies, marvel has tried to make jokes/cultural references to be funny, but they have turned out cringe. Thankfully, this movie didn't have lots of those. The plot had twists which were nice."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I know someone queer was involved in the making of this movie because it was far too weird and colorful and I loved every minute of it, and it goes to show you that of course critics disliked it to a considerably higher degree, and audiences loved it, when most critics feed on the mucus and algae that grows on the rocks and feet of culture, hoping to influence it enough to imitate being the next Ebert. The film loses points for me for maintaining certain family friendly tropes, not being political enough, and copying other storylines such as the the Ooze which is almost exactly like a Hitchiker's Babel Fish or John Carter's The Voice of Barsoom which ""..is a drink described as a ""strong foul smelling brew"" that the Tharks use to teach their children to speak, the infants are force-fed the drink. The effect seems to be almost immediate, the drinker being able to fully understand the barsoomian language.""

Michelle Pfeiffer is an icon, and she shines everytime her glorious alabaster wig is seen on screen, providing subtle facial movements that convey devastation and foreboding, and a dash of traumatized that anyone w/ a father can recognize. I wanna be her when I grow up.

Michael Douglas was the cool cat, the partner the average Cottage Core/commune queer may aspire to meet or become. Suavity and charm *queue Anthony Hopkins extinguishing the candles' flames w/ a whip while smoking a cigar.*

Even the villain commented on how right Evangeline's hair was. 

I wish Disney did more when criticizing the corrupt powers of police officers, but of course they never would, not when they as an animation studio were founded by a man who was a Hitler apologist. Therefore, they will insert just enough comments to make themselves look relatable w/ Gen-Z rather than address anything w/ environmentalism or BLM, who are the targets of police officers. If you're going to reference how cops are corruptly teargassing homeless people, talk about all the times they teargas peaceful protestors and homeless people, Disney. Don't just throw it in there just to make Kathryn look relatable. In today's age where we are having a resurfacing of Adolf's American Friends 1933-1937 and are approaching a recreation of a kind of the 1933 looting and burning Magnus Hirschfeld's Institute of of the Science of Sexuality who burned it down because it was the largest source of queer knowledge and gender studies in the world in 1930s Berlin, started since 1897. That is what we are dealing w/ right now, please address it, but yay, I guess, you shrunk a cop car.

Jonathan Majors. I fear you. And it's probably because you're a domestic abuser."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Story was good.  Still hate the metaverse stuff with Marvel.  Need to move on to something else, please!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a huge Marvel fan, this is definitely the best of the recent Marvel films. Jonathan Majors as Kang is absolutely Bad Ass and gives a thrilling performance. This is an exciting peek into the Kang phase of the MCU while still keeping the Comical, fun narrative of Ant-Man"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-Man!!! Wasp!!! The (Kang) Dynasty is upon us!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best beginning to set up phase 5 and Kang storyline
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good, mildly entertaining movie.  The problem is this:  All Marvel movies are ""the same.""  Very little variance in plot.  And sadly, most Marvel movies are now dependent on some version of ""multiverses.""  Sigh.  It's getting a bit old.  Not much creativity.  Still, I went knowing more or less that it would be like this (it was), and I still found it to be a generally entertaining movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie in the Ant-Man trilogy!! Don't believe what the critics here are saying! Go for it!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great fun! Good Dad Humor. Sets up Phase 5 well.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall a great movie, I would give it a A rating."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyable, fast pace and exciting. There were a few things that were a little over the top, but overall I enjoyed it. I think this was a decent start to the next phase."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was an amazing movie! The critics are almost always wrong about literally every single movie ever. Is anybody really surprised that the audience score vs the critics score reflects that here as well?
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A really nice movie better than phase 4 movies
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ant-Man's likeable quirkiness from earlier films is barely visible against the forgettable CGI jumble of videogame-like landscapes that look awfully reminiscent of 2022 Marvel entries Doctor Strange 2 and Morpheus. This movie unfortunately felt like ho-hum homework to bridge the gap with hopefully better Marvel entries to come.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was brilliant. Very flawed characters in way over their heads. Two hours of seeing things you never saw before.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Saw it last night and walked out of the cinema very happy. A very strong start to season 5 of the MCU. Spectacular MCU. Finally popular heroes again.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I couldn't believe how bad this was, zero redeeming qualities.  oh wait the ads for their other movies (mid and end credit scenes) teased movies that might not be as bad as Quantumnia"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked some parts, but there was too much going on in this one. I feel like they dragged this one out more, next Ant-man movie, will be waiting and watching at home."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Guys this is the great movie. U guys will enjoy watching this movie. Don't judge the movie only by tomatometre score. Watch the movie u will enjoy it, the story, and kang was mind blowing. And look at the audience score its great."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Continuous action-packed film, more serious ant-man movie, but still filled with heartwarming moments."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are worthless‚Ä¶.this was a fine addition to the Ant Man story. It provided a ton of text to backstories that needed finishing, questions answered for characters and a build up for a new era baddy that will do very well in entangling the next couple Marvel Phases. It was GO, from the start and didn‚Äôt let up, it was fun and had a great message of family. "
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie! It was great to finally have an entertaining and fun Marvel film to watch. The special effects were amazing and Kang was a great villain! Will watch again!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, great setup for whats to come."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun two hours, what else do you want from Scott Lang??
Look, my humble comics library includes almost 350 volumes and collections. Do you think they're all ""wow""? No, there are some which are just right, light reading, perhaps a set up for what's to come.. or an introduction to new characters, some of them bonkers (I'm looking at you, MODOK). And that's exactly what this movie was. I enjoyed it and, if I was one of those pretentious critics, I'd listen to Cassie Lang. Now, that's wisdom! LOL"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visually stunning, The 3D version was not worth seeing. Not a movie that I would want to see again. Was definitely lacking some Marvel magic."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang was such a good villian in this movie. The visuals looked amazing, and both end credits were 1000/10. Overall the movie is an 8.5/10 don't listen to all the people saying this movie is trash because this is definitely better than MoM, TLAT, and maybe  Black Panther 2."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Arriesgada y buena, se nota un mundo lleno de vida y logra divertir y gozar el viaje cu√°ntico e introduciendo al villano de los Vengadores"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing!! One of my favorites! Every character gives an outstanding performance. My favorite part was the humor, it was hilarious and action-packed! Ant Man movies are the best!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand critics. They want the movie to be a picture perfect depiction of their vision. They forget that audience cares about the entertainment value. If we had an inclination towards subject we will watch a documentary.  

Is this perfect, no, but it does its job of entertaining. Acting is good. Storyline is ok. CGI is ok. All in all an entertaining movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a great depiction of the gravity of Kang. Jonathon Majors is a perfect choice. He did more acting with just his eyes than any dialogue written for him. I look forward to seeing him as Kang being the Big Bad in future Marvel movies.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Es buena, no para morirse de la emoci√≥n, pero vale la pena"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's not the best MCU movie but its not the worst. Definitely some funny parts. Without spoilers I'll give no context: holes, broccoli, baskin robins, don't be a dick, Kang is badass."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was so bad that at the end the entire theater started yelling about how bad the movie was. Kang was the only redeeming thing in this movie the characters are boring and stale most of the jokes aren't funny and the ending was bad.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this was a solid outing and the best MCU release in a while.  Action humor and humanity were well balanced.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie. Best ant man film
Finale is ok 
Post credit üî•
I don't want them to waste more characters like modok"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the movie. Its starts very comical and then sucks you into the quantum  loop.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film feels like a filler for phase 4, marvel studios clearly didn't know what to do with antman 3 but obviously forced it out. The idea wasn't bad, but needed fixing to make more sense. The drama between cassie and her dad is not relevant or even important, it's just there for the shake of being there and feels unbelievable. The trailer ruined the ending and the ending itself didn't make much sense, more ridiculous if anything. The plot hole for janet van dym is confusing and ridiculous when she obviously had a way to get out of the quantum realm. Jonathan majors was good as kang, how ever it did feel like the studio and director were not comfortable with how they wanted this version of kang to be. The 3rd instalment has clearly lost the charm the other two ant man films have had, making this film somewhat bearable if you can check your phone every now and again while you watch it."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think it was very exciting and Jonathan Majors did a amazing job as Kang the conqueror. Also, there was lots of humor."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Like the other Ant Man films, it was a nice way to pass the time and get a few laughs and action beats. I feel like the scope and scale of this one took away from the small-time charm Ant Man has come to embody. It felt too busy and underdeveloped at the same time. But overall, an enjoyable watch."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely fantastic,  way better than I had expected, the best antman movie yet. So excited for the movie saga that this is the beginning of"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to these critics, they know NOTHING about comics or what appeals to Marvel & DC fans, they just want a sound bite so people click on their crappy review. This was a fun movie. Period. It's nAot an Oscar winner, because it's not supposed to be! Lol It's a great start to Phase 5, and sets up a bunch of the storylines to come in movies and tv shows coming out this year and next. The visuals were awesome, see it in IMAX 3D if you can."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While the introduction of Kang was exciting and has potential of being an incredible villain moving forward, Ant Man and the Wasp Quantummania was an ultimate disappointment. With the sheer power of Kang, it is corny and lame to have his first major battle defeat come from ants, followed by a simple fist fight with Scott and Hope. I'd hoped the story line, while continuing to keep the light hearted humor we all love from Paul Rudd/Ant Man, would be much darker, introducing a new era of the MCU. With each movie in Phase 4 being a sub-par effort from writers and creators, I imagined Phase 5 to launch into a darker, more mature version of the MCU. Johnathan Majors does deliver an amazing performance of Kang, and I hope his performance continues to mature and elevate as his character becomes more prominent in the universe as the next major villain. I wish the writing and plot gave him more room to truly showcase his skills, but I am still excited to see what he does moving forward. Overall, the movie was disappointing, but I guess that might just be the new trend with the MCU."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just incredible. I'm not even going to consider the critic ratings for movies on here any more because they seem to have an agenda, this movie had everything the MCU offers in abundance. It was funny, heartfelt, action packed, visually stunning and overall a very well rounded film. It wasn't overly predictable, however there were moments you could feel coming. 

Best MCU offering since Endgame. The future of the franchise seems safe if they can continue like this."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a fun movie, kids love it.  Good start for the new phase on MC Universe with and actors played it will.  Paul Rudd, still has that comical act on him. We were not bored."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very good film, with a good balance of humour and drama. The introduction of an important character for the rest of the films in the universe is very well done. This film is enjoyable to watch, it is a very good ant-man."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining and excellent special effects.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the new addition of Jonathan Majors!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Could‚Äôve done without seeing just being honest
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jonathan Majors is pretty much the only redeemable thing about this film. Terrible heists antman movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Definitely had me on the edge of my seat.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, not great! Definitely could have been better and I wouldn't have been so focused on the world building and cinematic multiverse expansion into Phase 5 and 6 but I am hyped for what is coming next. Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars are going to be EPIC! 

Jonathan Majors brought his A Game as Kang just like in Loki as He Who Remains. I wish there had been more interaction and dialogue before.. but definitely more to come! M.O.D.O.K was well established in the Quantum Realm and fit the narrative of the Ant-Man trilogy despite the major comic differences in origin. Kathryn Newton did a good job reintroducing the audience to Cassie Lang. Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas had great performances once again as Hank and Janet but I'd have preferred more screen time with them as they're OG Avengers in comics. Evangeline Lilly did a good job but once again, not enough screen time for Wasp. Paul Rudd brought his A Game as Scott Lang/ GiAnt-Man once again. I enjoyed the family theme throughout the trilogy and loved the darker tones and themes that were set in Quantumania. Great post credit scenes! Not the best movie ever but a solid sequel. I was entertained and felt the closure of a trilogy while an expansion towards a sequel and future crossover projects are inevitable.  Highly recommended to Marvel fans."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Compared to the other antman movies, this one is more serious. I also love the CGI and the design of the Quantum Realm. They introduced Kang very well. I don't get the hate from most critics but the movie was good and enjoyable to watch."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Inane. Felt like I was watching Sharkboy and Lavagirl or Monsters vs. Aliens.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,The best thing about this movie was the villain. Everything else was typical Hollywood formulaic canon. Lovable and goofy lead?  Check. Stale plot that has been used so many times that it is transparent?  Check. Oh so plucky youth that shows the older people the errors of their traditional ways?  Check. Convenient resolution after the main characters sacrifice themselves so all go back to normal?  Check. Completely ridiculous salvation vehicle with a nod to a proven failed social dynamic?  You bet.  Save your money and wait a month until this pap is aired on a network and then still don‚Äôt watch. It is that bad.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"CGI was really bad, movie seem rushed."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is good for what it is and is one of my favorite MCU movies. Yes M.o.d.o.k was handled as a goofy sidekick but at the end of the day it is a guy with a big head and small limbs. Ant-Man felt like Ant-Man and did not break character from motivation once. It is upsetting that Hope and Hank took a backseat during this one. Cassey could've been handled better and at times was more annoying than her 8-year old self. The acting from everyone was absolutely fantastic, especially the chemistry between Ant-Man and Kang. Kang was handled perfectly for 3/4s of the movie. Towards the ending they depowered him, but at the beginning where all you could do is hide it felt like he was an actual threat and especially in the scene with Scott and Cassey. Upsetting to see that some of my favorite characters from the Ant-Man movies were excluded but they wouldn't fit with the movie. Even though they could've been used in the beginning or end. This Movie is definitely better then Ant-Man and the Wasp in many ways where I liked this one more but Ant-Man and the Wasp does have the aforementioned characters. The visuals are amazing for what they could do because at the end of the day they had to make a cgi Quantum Realm so they had constant cgi that was draining the budget. This got me even more pumped for Loki S2, F4, Kang Dynasty, and Secret Wars. Also the idea of multiple Kang Variants is great but in this movie they looked goofy and did not feel like a real threat to the Avengers, especially since we saw Kang get taken down with Ants. This should have been the Rouge One of Marvel where the heroes are trying to win but in order to win they had to lose because that would have made this movie feel much more grand. It should have ended with Kang escaping and Scott and a few others stuck in the Quantum Realm where they tried using signals using Kang's technology, this could have led into the mysterious post-credit scene in Shang-Chi. All in all this movie was a great watch for theaters and if I were to go to a theaters again in the next month, this would the movie to watch."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,great film best in the ant man series
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie. After Thor love and thunder, I‚Äôve lowered my expectations for marvel so we were pleasantly surprised. It was funny and entertaining."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome time really enjoyed this movie and will see again
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie had good and bad things about it. I enjoyed the story and the humor and the characters were great. That was all fine. But the major issue I had with this movie (and a lot of people as well) is that this movie went against everything past movies put in place regarding the Quantum Realm. Examples include the 5 min:5 year ratio, requirement to wear a suit, etc. Based off of what past movies said, when the whole gang entered the Quantum Realm, they should've been dead, matter of fact probably blown up. There were some stupid lines like ""where are we?"" that really pissed me off for obvious reasons. My favorite character was MODOK, he was hilarious. And all the others were great. Overall, good and bad. The characters, humor and plot was all good, but the explanations and setting were all confusing and messed up. 6.9/10 for me."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"DO NOT PAY ANY MIND TO CRITIC RATINGS. Go see Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania - not one review is valid - Amazing and beautiful to look at, actors all in and committed, great villain, solid secondary characters, deepening of relationships, and fun!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. Was far better than Dr strange 2 Thor 4 and Black panther 2. Great action scenes and amazing world building. Had just the right amount of humor.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was long and drawn out. There is too much going on with the storyline.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania¬†was good and I was entertained for 2 hours but if I‚Äôm going to be honest, it could‚Äôve been way better."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Felt like I was watching a bad Star Wars movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"3 star only because of Kang. Otherwise, the movie is not that good. The script was absolutely stupid. There are Quantum people in the quantum world... and the dialogues of AntMan about life and sense reminded me of HitchHiker's Guide to the Galaxy (I liked that writing in the book but didn't go with this movie). The biggest disappointment was MODOK, they have ruined him. It was not funny and not enjoyable if you know the MODOK from Comics. 
This was the last time. That's it. Never going to waste my money on MCU. Better to wait and watch on TV."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"had a fun time overall, Kang is awesome!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was not the greatest movie by any stretch. HOWEVER it is NOWHERE near as bad as the critics and some others make it seem. Jonathan Majors is great as Kang. Michelle Phifer also really stands out. Like I said before, there are definitely different choices that could have been made to improve the movie. Script wise as well as the stakes, but see it for yourself with an open mind and don't pay the reviews any attention."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring experience. Kang tries to save the movie, but isn't enough"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The smaller plot was a great start and of the huge Kang Dyanasty arch about to come. Cannot wait for the end credit scene to reveal itself in the next big movie and mid credit scene in Loki season2! Best end credit scenes we've had in a while in my personal opinion along with story line. To the haters on this movie and the new material, they just always expect something Avenger sized and expect crazy storylines all the time. Amd had some great easter eggs. But overall this movie hit right where it needed to and was very good at character development of the ant fam and Kang. Not sure that will be the last time we see that variant of Kang."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,its a good family movie but dont belive the critics review...
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun movie. Dunno what all the critics are complaining about.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this one ! 
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,There was a couple slow scenes that could almost put you to sleep.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"More than I expected, loaded with a good mix of humor and action"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Guys don't believe the negative reviews you will definitely enjoy the movie
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just tired of jokes where they don't belong ruining immersion and any sense of stakes.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Why is it that MCU always gives their ""petty cash"" to Ant-man to make a movie? It's like they have a penny jar in the back of the studio and when it fills up someone says oh time to make an Ant-man movie ! The movie just doesn't have the gravitas of so many other MCU, characters and genres. Even the background animation is lackluster in comparison to the worst Thor movie. Even Guardians of the Galaxy  gets more top drawer treatment as compared to Ant-man and the Wasp. I really enjoyed Jonathan Major, and his role as the Conqueror but even at times he became a little too melodramatic. Maybe that's from his drama training at NYU and he thought he was in some Shakespearean play with a blue screen in the back.  And those horrible ""Dick"" jokes toward the end was idiotic and let audience ""sigh"".. from the vapid and unstable plot lines. This movie was a giant failure for MCU fans. Wait for it to come out on Disney and save your money."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The plot was good, action scenes were cool to watch, but the ending wasn't what I thought it would be. Overall, the movie was pretty solid."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,really good marvel film and excellent way to start phase 5.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,it was a lot of fun.  very formulaic but so what?!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A classic sci fi story that leans loyally on the Marvel characters, Ant Man 3 delivers with the expected good humor throughout."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Complete fun!  Jonathan Majors was fantastic. Paul Rudd was Paul Rudd so no complaints. Great chemistry with all involved. Michael Douglas gives an understated performance with his love and annoyance with Scott Lang. Go see this movie  I feel the negative reviews are just desperate attempts to bring about the Marvel fatigue they have been predicting for years. The the critics I say ""It's never too late to not be a dick."""
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a very good add to the Ant-man series and the bridge to the MCU phase, especially with the post and post -post credit scenes which everybody who knows MCU should just anticipate and expect now! Overall really good movie!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"None of MCU, in my opinion deserves a 90%+ RT agg ratings. This was not that different than what we have been getting from MCU. So this current rating on RT comes off as critics trying prove they are not shills for Disney. Better than Wakanda Forever! This is a solid ""B"" movie"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"There are 2 end credits. Movie was great with good CGI! However, I would advise everyone to watch Disney plus Loki series before entering the theater! They are closely link to TIME! ‚è≤Ô∏è"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Majoritatea filmului a fost interesant, √ÆnsƒÉ au amestecat unele lucruri, »ôi cred ca nu era necesar"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly don't understand the hate from critics. The cast was fantastic, and my daughter and I both really enjoyed the action and humor through out the movie. My thoughts are that this is a fun movie made for the fans and not the snobby critics."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it was pretty good. I don‚Äôt think it deserves too much hate like why critics gave. Something‚Äôs were meh but overall was pretty good. I enjoyed watching. 
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall, the movie was pretty good. Kang was a frightening villain and we really got to see Cassie's personality shine. Though at times it feels a bit rushed and sometimes sloppy, it did not ruin the movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great time! Kang is excellent, looking forward to see where they take the story from here"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie overall!  A couple of minor things, though, bothered me.  Is Kang a savior of the multiverse or a conqueror?   Did he die or not?  What superhero is Cassie going to be?  A lot of unanswered questions but maybe that was on purpose?"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought it was ridiculously corny with an implausible plot and characters that just weren't likeable. My kids and husband enjoyed it. My husband has read the original origin stories so he had a different perspective than someone who wants a fun couple of hours escaping to the movies
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"When you set a movie in a sub-atomic universe that has zero impact on the lives of the viewers, you never create a connection that matters. What were the stakes of this film? Kang might get out and do something, somewhere  on another timeline? Who cares? Scott may get trapped in the Quantum Realm? Good riddance - he's annoying. This should have been an episode of Loki Season 2 with a brief cameo by the Ant Man cast.

If not for Jonathan Major, this film wouldn't rate half a star. His performance is the only enjoyable part of the movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was it one of the best MCU movies? No, of course not. Was it an action-packed Sci-Fi movie, with a fun cast of known MCU characters, starring the new Big Bad of the new cycle, Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror, some new characters to mix it up, with some off-beat family humor like we expect from Ant-Man movies, with some touching moments? Yes, it absolutely was. Was it sometimes corny as hell? Sure, but what's wrong with that when it's part of the Ant-Man schtick? Were there some plot holes and obvious plot armor? Duh.  Were there changes to comic story lines and characters, that were sure to piss off some purist fans, as well as some ""woke"" lines (don't get me wrong - I'm ""woke"" as hell and agree with those lines) that will piss off conservatives? Damn straight and hell yeah.

Did my daughter and I enjoy it? Absolutely! Don't plan on seeing it in-theater again like we did for BP2 Wakanda Forever or Dr. Strange MOM, but it was good MCU fun.

Only real bit that rubbed me wrong was MODOK's arc. Too easy a flip for someone who's been a dick from the beginning. Waste of a good villain, but he was pretty weird, so maybe not one they cared about keeping."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It is very clear with this new installment from Marvel that they peaked with the Infinity Saga. Marvel continues to put out movies and spin off shows that are just filler, characters that nobody really cares about on their own and just flat out disappointing. Sure, Paul Rudd's Antman was entertaining the first go around but now it is just forcefed to us to pass 2 hrs instead of giving everyone what they really want which is a real Marvel movie with epic action and characters. Majors' Kang was MEH at best and he is definitely not what he was made out to be. I found him boring and easily forgotten. Best part about this movie was M.O.D.O.K."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best rant-Man movie yet! Opens up the MCU to unlimited possibilities. Funny/awkward moments that worked in this film where wouldn‚Äôt in others
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good. A bit predictable at times but had a darker tone with good comedic timing. Solid start to phase 5.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie with good acting. Never board and kept my attention. Not the best marvel story line but holds its own. Felt abit like a star wars movie
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, great story and a hint of comedy"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Beat Ant-man yet! Entertaining movie over all and an awesome intro for Kang. 
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!! The Best Ant-Man Movie Yet! Coming from a Marvel super fan! 8 out of 10!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,All u need to say is KANG HAS ARRIVED!!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Nonstop action‚Ä¶just the right amount of comedy‚Ä¶really enjoyable!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A tad too long, a bit too much CGI.  Follows th ant man formula - action, charm, humor.  The villian is excellent.  A middle of the pack Marvel villian."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good MCU movie, excellent villain character with compelling plot. A few details get lost along the way but all in all, a good movie and worth the price of admission."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily the best of the Ant Man movies and now in my top five favorite Marvel movies, along with the first Doctor Strange and the first Black Panther movies. It is a quick watch, the story moves rapidly and it is chock full of action. I especially liked that all of the characters get screen time to show off their powers (Cassie, Hope, Hank and Janet). And Kang is a great villian. 

Well worth watching in the theater. I watched it in IMAX 3D and again in just IMAX, and I preferred the plain IMAX screening. The 3D version did not add much to the experience, unlike it did for Avatar."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a surprisingly good movie, despite what the ""critics"" would tell you, and it's the first MCU film since Endgame which I can say was actually good and worth watching (aside from Spider-Man: No Way Home, which was made by Sony). First off, the characters are mostly good, with Ant-Man of course being a stand-out, and I liked Hank and Janet in this movie a lot. However, the stand-out easily goes to Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror, who is easily the best part of the movie and makes it in my opinion. Every scene Kang is in is automatically awesome, he's smart, strong, menacing and played by a great actor. They've done a good job setting Kang up as the primary antagonist of the Multiverse Saga, and I want to see more Kangs like this in the future. The CGI is also good, and the storyline is simple but effective, however, there are a few issues here and there. Another thing I liked in this movie is that it doesn't feel like a marvel movie, it feels more like a Star Wars movie in its tone and setting, which is something that I, being a massive Star Wars fan, greatly appreciated. However, the movie is not perfect, and there's a few things that bothered me, such as how MODOK does not need to be in the movie, he adds nothing of value, and there is a certain thing that happens near the end with Kang which annoyed me. Also, Cassie Lang is just an okay character, not good, not bad, just okay, and I wouldn't be too happy if they replaced Scott and Hope for Cassie. Overall, Quantumania is a pretty good movie, setting up Kang and the Multiverse Saga pretty well, however, it in no way makes me any more excited for Phase 5 or Avengers: The Kang Dynasty or Secret Wars. But we'll just have to wait and see if marvel can indeed rekindle the magic the franchise has so lost since Endgame."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Better than critics reviews.  It's different than previous  AntMan movies but different  is good. If you're not invested  in the Disney + marvel universe you may not understand the meaning of everything so a casual  fan may miss out on the storyline. I'm glad they balanced the tone and humor. I enjoyed it!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Another fun Marvel movie with a great cast!  Enjoyed it from beginning to end.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just couldn't get into this installment.  Honestly most of the Ant-Man movies have been ok, this one tried too hard to be something it's not.  I understand the need to introduce the next big villain, but if the strongest variant of Kang gets stopped by Ant-Man and his crew.....oof.  comedy spots were good though.  Mordok was....rough.  he looked ridiculous but I'm sure it was tough to get that rendered any better than it was.  All in all it's a C+ to B- movie.  Marvel is starting to become a little watered down.  There's no connection to the current characters, so it's tough to care much about what happens to them and this movie is just another example of that."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it on Friday. The cast were great as always, and you got to see a lot more of the family. Funny and gripping. The visuals were amazing so shout out to the artists involved."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sure there was a Star Wars feel to the movie, and there were some hokey characters, but overall, I really liked this movie. The core 5 were well written and portrayed for the most part. Kang was fantastic. I loved it!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wanted to love it, but couldn't .. an ok watch. 
Neither as bad as the critics say but Kang performance  is being way too overhyped when he is hardly there. 
At the end of the movie, you will feel exactly like what the end quote of the movie is... "" Meh, it's alright"" 
The best cheer comes for the post credit scene, mid credit scence is for the comic book nerds like me."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A total fever dream of a movie
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was gorgeous and a fun time all around! Most of the jokes landed and the runtime was perfect. I thought it kept the tone of the previous two Ant-Man movies, while being a bridge to this phase of the MCU."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a great ride. This is genius character development of kang. We met his variant in loki, we heard his back story, the love of his comics went rogue from the tva to find kang.I think some of these critics have missed the supporting shows and movies. If you don't like or understand the source material, just stay home and stay off the internet. Everybody review has an obvious tone of either mcu prejudice or ignorance. 
Literally saw reviews of poor character development of kang , lmao. You ousted yourself there bro! You just missed it all and review where the money is while riding the hate train"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"thought this movie was good. on par with the other ant man movies. went in with low expectations due to the ratings,  but this was way better than thor love and thunder, and maybe the best ant man movie"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Gostei das atua√ß√µes, principalmente do Jonathan Majors, por√©m n√£o foi o suficiente pra fazer o filme ser bom, pra mim √© mediano o filme em si, tudo se resolve muito f√°cil e o vil√£o do filme √†s vezes parecia se esquecer dos seus poderes e perde de maneira f√°cil, diminuindo a amea√ßa que o Kang deveria ser"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Bagus kok cerita baik dibanding thor love and thunder dan black panther 2. Cukup baik untuk lead ke event avengers the kang dynasty
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great introduction to Kang and a very good start for phase 5. Had a lot of fun watching the movie as you would expect from an ant-man movie although this one is a little more serious.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Johnathon Majors was great.. it's a shame the writing, acting, stakes and tone of the movie everywhere else were so poor."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great not sure why it is receiving so much hate. If you are a marvel fan you will really enjoy the movie!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The script missed the mark, hard, on any character development. Arcs were set up and then just abandoned. Two hours in a cg environment was too long for a live action film. Everything started to feel fake. Too many characters popping in and out. So many missed opportunities with character exploration. Just a bad story."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang helped that movie better than other weird characters
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A movie that puts superhero movies back on the topshelf after the massive letdown of Black Adam. Ant-Man 3 is captivating from start to finish. Special effects, attractive talented cast and creative storyline give this movie a truley 5 star rating. Very well written, directed and produced."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a great movie .....
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie love the way marvel set up kang ! 10/10
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Extremely fun film, this is the marvel formula at one of its strongest."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie and the CGI was just crazyyyyy
It could be the comeback for Marvel's CGI.
I really don't know what products the people at Rotten Tomatoes are consuming that they rater the movie 48%."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was fantastic start to finish. It is strong throughout. It introduces the Quantum realm in a way we have not seen it before. 

New ally's are formed. I would expect at some Avengers End Game-esq moment of need the citizens and heroes of the quantum realm will appear. 

The stakes are high, Kang variants will be around throughout phase 5 & 6. This is an impressive first showing for Kang in the movies. 

The film is light and happy, with a moment of clarity towards the end that lays way for what is to come. A year or two from know we will all look back as see this movie as the pivot point for the wider story, but it contains a wonderful story of the evaluation of the Antman & Wasp story."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Desnecess√°rio citar socialismo uma empresa que √© puro capitalismo...desnecess√°rio colocar falas de trai√ß√£o uma palha√ßada. O filme como Star Wars t√° de boa...M.O.D.O.K. se revolta contra o Kang para n√£o ser considerado um ot√°rio. 
O Kang √© um Z√© ruela fracote perde pra formigas."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,RT critic are dumb and don't have social. Don't believe them.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Ignore the critics! This movie is a fun ride and sets up Kang as the new MCU Big Bad quite nicely. Well worth a trip to the theater.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kang the conqueror was overpowered by ants. Modok was a pathetic sidekick. Just another Disney channel movie special like Thor Love and Thunder, stole this review because it's short, simple and right on the money."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Spectacular work of escapism. Couple of surprise cameos & - as always - you need to wait until the last credit has rolled as there's a teaser for what's to come.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was funny and entertaining. Loved it in 3D
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Definitely one of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe movies of recent times!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"‚ÄúGive it to me, Janet.‚Äù"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie it was fun entertaining filled with action this a must go see movie the critics on rotten tomatoes wouldn't know a good movie if fell in there lap 5 stars
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Very interested movie everyone enjoyed
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania kickstarts Phase 5 as a prelude to Kang Dynasty/Secret Wars.

Unlike Phase 4 which feels directionless at times, Phase 5 introduces a threat in the form of Kang, who is also going to be the big bad of the Multiverse Saga. The storyline was more focused on Kang's introduction and motives. The real MVP of the show is Jonathan Majors who plays Kang The Conqueror, its like he was born to play the role.

You don't have to rely on those mixed critics reviews, watch it & make your own judgement, cause apart from few drawbacks, I fell the overall movie was great. 

Don't miss those 2 end credit scenes!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This should not be called Ant Man and the Wasp as both get no character development and little action. The special effects are poor, the plot and character development are cookie cutter and the title should have been 'we want to sell you socialism'. The badly CGI Modok seems to have more gravitas and range than Jonathan Majors Kang, even if you accept some of the contrived plot points. If this is the Iconic Villain for Phase 5, then marvel are screwed! Pfeiffer and Douglas are largely phoning it in but you cant blame them with a plot and script this bad.
Why they decided to replace Cassie Langs actress from the last movie with a disney princess is beyond comprehension. Oh and the Credit scenes arent worth hanging around for. Dont waste your time or your money on this movie!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this movie, I watched it in imax 3d and it really made the movie pop."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"good movie, don't be swayed by the critics, it's a good movie"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Going in to this had me worried, the Critics review was abysmal and everyone was starting to doubt on how the quality would turn out. However I am happy to say that Quantumania is hands down the best thing marvel has produced since no way home. Impressive world building, great development of established characters as well as newly introduced characters and finally gives us a great villain that could be placed alongside the likes of Thanos or ultron. This is a film that should be on everyone's radar and something that everyone should form their own opinions of instead of listening to what others say as film is subjective."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie has to be about 95% CGI and it feels like it was written by a team of executives without a filmmaker in sight
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Molto coinvolgente, e Kang √® un cattivo sopraffino."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ich bin echt zufrieden mit dem Film. Ich hab das Gef√ºhl der Film h√§tte bei Mavel in der Phase 3 spielen k√∂nnen und ich hab echt Spa√ü. Ich mag die Action, die Komidie hat mir gefallen und Gang ist Phantastisch. Nat√ºrlich hat der Film ein paar Probleme aber um ehrlich zu sein bin ich seit langem echr zufrieden aus einem Mavel Film gegangen. Ich gebe dem Film eine 8/10 Punken. Auf jeden Fall eine Kino empfehlung wert."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, 3rd best Multiverse Saga movie so far (after Spiderman & Shang Chi). As a skeptic, Im not sure what's all the hate towards this movie is about, I think hating Marvel is just becoming a trend. Looking foward to more Kang"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"amazing movie, it is the best ant man movie. MARVEL has done a brilliant work. It is an amazing start to phase 5"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, this movie is so ground breaking. This was my favorite Marvel movie. You could literally watch it twice in a row - once watching the characters and once just watching everything in the background - it's that beautiful. 

It was funny and very very well done. I have no idea how anyone could give this a bad rating."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A bit different to other Movies in the series,
But really grows the characters and develops the story in new ways,
Jumps right into the action.

Kang is hands down someone im excited to see more of!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was a complete mess. It feels like things just happen in the movie because ""That's what you're supposed to do at this part of the movie"". The villains are weird and shallow. The heroes don't really develop. It felt like a pointless movie made just to set up the next movie in the MCU. This is the problem with modern movie and superhero movies in particular, they just exist to make money and to justify the next movie. It's not art, it's a money printing machine."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not nearly as fun as the previous two instalments. This one is claustrophobic, mostly green screen filmed and once again the multiverse, albeit this time in micro quantum space is tiring."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just awful in every aspect. This has absolutely nothing to do with cinema or good film making.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Film ini sangat bagus dunia yang disajikan sangat berbeda dari seri ant man sebelum nya, banyak hal baru yang terungkap."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie sucked. Everything in the movie is generic and predictable. Typical marvel cookie cutter material. Hardly any laughs , weak action scenes, boring characters/monologues, and last of all weak story. They had a baskin robins guy in full uniform smashed into one of the third act climactic scenes lmao. How many good movies has the daughter tell a bad guy in a sincere not sarcastic tone ""it's never to late to stop being a dck"" lol boring movie save your money"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a pure MCU flick with a simple story that could have gone deeper but this is a movie about building the next big bad and Kang is terrifying he steals the show and makes you scared for anyone facing him in the future, if was fun lighthearted at times and the effects were good plus it's quite short too, whole not perfect it's far from bad it's entertaining even if it's nothing memorable but I'm sure this film will be very important going forward and those post credits scenes stay around for them :)"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst Marvel to date. I really don't understand Marvel thinks this is a worthy successor to the earlier Ant-man movies. Those we're at best okay but this one... 2 hours of my life I will never get back...
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't understand the hate, realy liked Kang, MODOK was a big ass joke though...."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have like or loved most of the marvel films as a comic and movie fan and this is the third mcu film that disappointed. Ant Man Quantumania is movie that starts with the promise of adventure and fails to deliver the thrills. 
Dull terribly lit scenes and with action scenes that feel uninspired and rushed with a few exceptions and jokes that fall flat the only thing holding this movie together ends up being Jonathan majors in the role of Kang the conqueror."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked it! 
Sure it's more comedy than we are used to from the past marvels. But I think it's something we can get used to and look at the new movies with an open mind. I love the comedy to break the action scenes ! 
And I love the family story behind it"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang the conqueror was overpowered by ants. Modok was a pathetic sidekick. Just another Disney channel movie special like Thor Love and Thunder
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw the movie! I will surely miss the grounded heist genre feel of Antman. But, introducing Kang and the expanded world of the quantum realm made this movie very interesting and enjoyable. 2 very big post credit scenes made me excited for a certain disney plus series as well."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie loved everything in it
Specifically kang
Scary villain"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally a marvel movie that ¬´feels¬ª like a superhero movie without being utterly silly or extremely serious and dramatic. This has a great balance of comedic relief and manages to set the seriousness of the threat that Kang is. Btw, Jonathan Majors is really a frightening villain and he did a wonderful job"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Well a good start to the phase 5 . Enjoyable and fun movie ends with a bang . And don't miss the mid and the post credit scenes
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Captivating throughout. A perfect introduction of Kang. Critics argue that it isn't similar enough in style to other movies in the franchise,  but we didn't pay to see a re-run. Great hero movie from start to finish."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A good watch, doesn't deserve the hate it gets from critics"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Movie was decent, nothing special. Hank spends his whole life researching quantum realm. Scott's daughter easily makes a machine to access quantum realm within the span of a limited number of years, with no true explanation. Kang was nerfed, Cassie character was very cringe, but there's no avoiding that she will be replacing ant man soon due to Marvel replacing Male characters in the MCU."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the hate for this film. It's the classic enjoyable marvel formula. It's not going to be the best film you see and it's not the worst.

Funny, well paced and enjoyable. Yeah there are a few weak points with the plot but where isn't there"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the escape from reality my kids and I needed from the past 6 months. Kang is here and Kang will Conquer!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story. Incredible special effects ! And top notch acting from all the actors !!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are weird man this movie was amazing
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang was the only good part of the film and even he was nerfed.another failure of a marvel film i miss the good mcu
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The 3rd Ant Man movie doesn't fail to impress to show the in-depth magnitude and scale of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. We are introduced to so many next exciting characters and creatures, not to mention our understanding of the quantum realm has been completely transformed in the process!
The returning cast knock it out of the park with their humor, emotional and heroic moments, but if this film has done one thing for me and EVERYONE watching it..........it's the realisation that Jonathan Majors Kang is the most terrifying new threat the MCU will have to face!!!
Kang is so scary and powerful, but this performance was made 100 times more impact full thanks to Majors acting and Reeds direction.

In short I have absolutely no idea why the critics slamed this movie, my large group of a dozen regular movie going friends (where some hate marvel and others love it) they all enjoyed Ant Man 3's movie experience and we all thought this movie started off not just the year but Phase 5 with a bang, or should I say a KANG!!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a thorough fun and enjoyable movie on its own. Kang was menacing.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How much CGI one can watch!
Another boring movie with a weak storyline."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, nice addition to MCU. Can't wait for Kang's return!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I know that the motive of the film is too straightforward about cassie and scott and going home. But, overall I still think that the film itself is a big improvement through the phase 4 of MCU, the character are amazing, and it's still connecting the whole scape now. Love the film. It can still be better but through every mistake in the latest product of the studio."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, if a little formulaic. Marvel has always been good at surprises. They need to remember that. All in all a good movie with good storytelling and introduction of Kang. Scott's charchters does need more depth though. In an entire movie about him, it's surprising that there wasn't much learned about his charachter that wasn't known before"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't care what the critics said, I had a blast with this movie!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another day, another mediocre Marvel film. Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors give really good performances. Bill Murray also has a funny cameo. Everyone else however is average at best, with the worst being Cassie's actress Kathryn Newton who had no emotion in her acting and her character came off more annoying than anything. I guess I should blame the writers more for her character as they're the ones who made her the way she is; a teenage girl who has fallen into the Quantum realm and doesn't display any emotions of fear or sadness, despite death and explosions going on all around her, and nearly every line she says has her screaming ""Dad!"". The CGI is good but not great and M.O.D.O.K is as bad as he looks in the memes going around. Overall the film is just more of the same we've gotten from Marvel over the last few years."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyed it don't think it deserved all the hate from the critics but suppose  That all why all film viewers are subjective, entertaining all the way , Paul Rudd was great as always, but Johnathan majors as Kang was the standout in this film , and he's going to be a great adversary for the rest of the MCU going forward."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing! A fresh new look at the quantum realm!
Also insanely funny!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"All in all I thought it was a great movie and the perfect introduction to phase 5. However I do have to say I was little disappointed by the last minute rescue by Cassie, I think Scott and Hope should have stayed in the Quantum realm."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"THE AUDIENCE SCORE PROVES THE LOVE OF TRUE FANS OF ANTMAN, NOT OF THE WHOLE MARVEL FANBASE. THIS WAS A PERFECT TRILOGY FOR SCOTT, HOPE, CASEY, HANK AND JANET AND THE BEAUTIFUL THEATRICAL INTRODUCTION FOR JONATHAN MAJORS KANG THE CONQUEROR. THE MOVIE WASN'T PERFECT AND WAS DEFINITELY CLICHE FOLLOWING  MARVELS USUAL MOVIE FORMULA BUT I REALLY ENJOYED IT. KANG STEALS THE SHOW! MAKE SURE TO STAY FOR THE POST CREDIT SCENE AND AFTER CREDIT SCENE."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie feels lacking in all departments and overly goofy. Big name villains are defeated fairly easily and just felt like the writing wasn't strong
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I think the critics of today probably do not understand why people actually go to see movies.  This was a great Marvel movie. It was beautifully made and the acting was great.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Read the reviews before hand, so I was prepared for disappointment. But I really enjoyed it!  It answered a lot of questions.  Lots of action. As others have said, the third act was best, but the beginning was needed to explain the rest.  The mid-credit and end-credit  Easter eggs are must-sees!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Top-8 in my UCM ranking so far.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A great start for Phase 5. It's not really really great but its pretty goof
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Personally, I loved this movie. I was far from home and had to watch it alone, still I enjoyed each and everything about the movie. Paul Rudd is love. I'd definitley watch it again just to see him on big screen. Jonathan Major's Kang was omg.. the best thing in the movie.
Story was predictable, yes. But it's a lovely movie to watch."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't think critics should keep their jobs . When over 2000 people give it an 84 how's it fair that 200 can give it a 48. This movie was action packed from beginning to end. The world itself was amazing.  Bill Murray could've had more screen time but the fact that he called the young girl that plays Scott's daughter Cassie to see if he could be in the movie let's you know how many people love the marvel universe.  I've seen every show on every channel and loved all of them . Hell I even like Thor the dark world.  I mean it at the bottom of his 4 movies but his latest movie is great. I'd love to see all of them again but the directors cuts. I bet the critics would give higher score.  DCs best shows are canceled Titans and Doom Patrol is why I kept hbo. Now the best thing they got going for them is Harley Quinn and peacemaker. The Snyder version was way better then the Weeden bomb.  I love James Gun but you kept the movie who's star smacks women.  Grant Gustin should be the flash in the movies.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,it might be the best Ant-Man movie. I would recommend it.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was cool the special effects was out of this world Antman proven himself as an Avenger facing off with a multiverse destructor Kang the Conqueror  his entrance was chillin when he first meets scott and one liners had powerful meaning on why he's the one that know it all how it ends.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely the very worst Marvel sort of ""let's just keep doing what we do"", but worse""
They are never going to uphold the legacy of the originals. Avengers, Iron Man, Captain America. This movie in particular, was horribly acted, very stiff on Michelle P and Michael D, I really tried to stay till the end but at about 90% I had to go,
Not recommended. It will reflect in box office sales and end shortly with a whimper,"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Only a great villain make hero great this four stars for kang
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great concept. Need little knowledge of quantum physics to enjoy the plot, fullest."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp : Quantumania takes the fun and humour of the ant-man movies, and applies it to very drastic and dangerous threats to the overall MCU. It successfully introduces familiar characters, new friends and of course, our very first look at the new high level threat to the MCU, Kang the Conquerer. 

The pacing was great, and it felt like it jumped into the main story very quickly, without feeling rushed. 

The stakes were high, and the action was intense! Highly recommend this film if you saw Love and Thunder and want to see MCU comedy done right."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyable with negligible flaws.
Lovely watch."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,It didnt looked good
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,movie was awesome yall critics trippin'
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In my opinion, it was just an ok movie, they could have done so much more with what they had set up and they failed to make something good. Not only was this version of Kang a disappointment but just underwhelming, this Kang was supposed to be the strong one and could destroy timelines but can beat a group of ants? Yeah I was disappointed and I just hope marvel can get good writers again"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics got it very wrong. You don't go to a Marvel movie to see Schindlers List. This was a fun beautiful movie very much in the same vein as recent Star Wars movies.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,veb carried the movie
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,loved this movie Marvel are back in a big way. its setting up phase 5 in a big way and is far better than the last three movies from Marvel. the best Antman movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The fans in Facebook groups are asking us to give a good rate to this film to defeat the critic's opinion but it was so mediocre another comedy filler full of fart jokes. I can't do it, Marvel is dying slowly in front of our eyes and is hard to deny it."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,disappointed in the overall plot as if nothing terrible and irreversible happen. everything went back to normal by the end of the movie.. no shock value there and certainly no emotional value as well unlike endgame final scene.Utter waste of opportunity. Truly disappointed.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly don't know why people dislike this movie so much. Kang lived up to his hype in every scene he was in and modak was super good in my opinion but wasted. And antman and the family were just good like they are in the rest of the movies but in my opinion this movie was a 8.5/10 and would watch again.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Was the movie I've ever seen.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"DEFINITELY WORTH IT, PERFECT SET UP FOR THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PHASE FOR THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok. I enjoyed Kang but the other characters were just muh the main plot wasn't too interesting but it did pass the time
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Action from beginning to end.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad jokes, terrible script, obvious character arks, nothing original, Paul Rudd was terrible and doesn't suit this role. I am so gutted as I love Kang in the comics and I was hoping they would start this new phase well but it has no personality and is full of bland moments and obvious twists. I really hope they turn it around in the next phase because I doubt I will watch more of this"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Its not perfect by any meany, but it was great in many parts. Jonathan majors was qmazing, along with the rest of the ant family."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the Daddy & daughter aspect in Quantumania. Good sci-fi movie that the family can enjoy together‚Ä¶.communication is the key
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"the production, and the special effects were amazing, i feel like the villain should show a little more power, and cassie has a little more training but i really loved her, i can't wait for the next movies in order i hope a production that surpasses the expectations of his fans"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's weird that people are downing this movie for uncanny CGI and not being grounded for a character who can literally shrink down so small that they can enter a whole other universe. At the same time we're literally talking about a comic book character who's been revived (daughter too) multiple times throughout multiple serious and yet critics view this COMIC BOOK movie as mid. Imo this was a great introduction to Phase 5 and a very compelling look into what the different possibilities of Kang can look like. Ignore critic reviewers and go into this movie with an excitement of Marvel Comics storylines and I think you'll really enjoy it.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was amazing from start to finish. Can't wait for the next avenger movie
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics need to lighten up a bit. I felt as entertained as any other movie in high scores.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Strongest Ant-Man movie, it had a lot of heart. Kang is perfectly menacing."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,SO Exciting YAY YAy AYY
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is decent very much better than recent shitty marvel movies and shows like love and thunder and she hulk . They worked really hard on writing of kang though didn't clearly explained his powers , but the way they connect his past with Janet was wonderful. The film could have been best if they focus more on screenplay ."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, entertaining! Majors killed it, am so excited for more Kang!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent setup of phase 5. Movie is fast paced and satisfying. It seems the armchair critics decided on hating on Marvel this year because they can, not based on actual quality. This movie is a must see for anybody watching the MCU, more then any phase 4 movie was"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Nothing really new, just another standard MCU movie. A little bit worse than last Doctor Strange. Classic colorful movie for kids, with simple humour. MCU needs a reboot, almost the whole 4th phase is solid nonsense."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great marvel film since thor love and thunder
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Na minha humilde opini√£o, √© o melhor filme do Homem Formiga e, talvez, um dos melhores da Marvel."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Wish they resurrect MODOK (not Darren Cross) in the future movies.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty entertaining.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,The end of Kang the conqueror felt rushed and a last minute change. Could have neen a lot better.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Didn‚Äôt at all understand all the negative reviews. Movie was wild, funny, high stakes, and grand. A ton of fun. If you compare this film to the greatest movies of all time as a movie it doesn‚Äôt come close. But fun and entertainment is the name of the game and they killed it"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a great way to start of phase 6! I‚Äôve collected comics for over 30 years and each time they find a new way to bring the characters and some of the popular stories to life, makes me fall in love all over again with comics! This story had it all‚Ä¶if I could critique anything it would be some Star Wars similarities. Great movie though!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Meh.
It's just ok 
Not good, not bad just ok that's it.
Only thing that stands out is jonathan majors as kang ."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Good one all the way around
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was a good and entertaining film in the series but like a filler episode in your favorite show. this is more ground laying and set up for the new big baddie and more on the Multiverse. It's not a bad movie at all, though. Paul Rudd and Cast do very well"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It had the content of both drama and comedy. And the whole plot that teases TheKangDynasty gets me excited  more than ever. Great movie
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE YET KANG AND MODOK STOLD THE WHOLE FLIM I JUS REALLY CANT WAIT TO SEE WHAT MARVEL HAS IN STORE FOR KANG BECAUSE LIKE THEY SAID MORE SURPRISES ARE ON THE WAY
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I had such high hopes for this film, Scott Lang has long been considered as one of my top five Marvel Characters - which makes this film all the more disappointing. I physically had to force myself to sit through the whole movie: it felt like a never-ending chore. The humour was clunky and didn't fit in with the tone of the film and the acting was lacklustre. If this is the direction that they're heading with Phase 5 then I shudder to think of once again being sat in the cinema in order to watch a Marvel film."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I came into this movie without high hopes and I was left feeling about the same. 
Not the best, but not the worst of Marvel. Some parts were pretty cool, but others felt weaker, especially in the script writing and acting. 
Quantumania left me feeling ""meh"" with all of it. For some reason, Marvel movies have recently been feeling rushed with pacing of the film, and not taking the necessary time in building up the plot. It's almost like a roller coaster, a lot happening all at once that leaves you feeling dazed. 
Is it worth the $12? Possibly, but you might enjoy it more if you're high or drunk...or maybe even both."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The 3D effects are quite good. U can see that this is a big budget movie and is better than average (200 milion$) . Kang (the conqueror) dinasty started with Loky tv series and now is being brought to a wider audience. Overall, not great, not terrible. 3.6 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Seriously so bad. Who was on acid when they made this? Marvel is in the pits
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't think I saw the same movie as a lot of the critics. 
Quantumabia was a fun, entertaining and self-contained story. Sure - as it's introducing the new 'big bad' it also does it's fair share of set-up, but not to the detriment of the story.
Definitely had a bit of a Star Wars flavour, but that tastes good.
This gets me excited for the rest of Phase 5."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fantastic heart felt science fiction/fantasy story with loads of great acting. 
This is a must see, stay through the credits. 

Phase: 5 is on the right track."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The concept and the special effects of the movie were amazing and had so much potential. Unfortunately, the plot felt jumpy and they used several cop-outs to get the characters out of the bad situations they were in. They also spent too much time on some characters and not enough on others."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Loved it. Boggles my mind the negative reviews critics are leaving. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre being critical or something. Go figure. And go watch this movie, Rudd and Majors rock! "
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid MCU cinema trip worthy entry.  Majors Kang is excellent and Paul Rudd is on point.  A fun  blockbuster with a unique look and feel.  I would t mind going back to the quantum realm again
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its a fun ride with an amazing villain, one of the better films that marvel have done in recent times"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was actually very fun and it was good to have decent looking CGI for once
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A step in the right direction. Loved Jonathan as the villain. The movie was serious when it needed to be. I don't understand how Thor, and Eternals recieved higher critic scores. Thor was really bad compared to this. This was fun, enjoyable and a good time! At this point I have no faith in critic scores. I feel like this is just review bombing."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"In a nutshell‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre a fan of Marvel, you‚Äôll enjoy this starting point to Phase 5. If you‚Äôre a casual watcher with no real investment in the MCU, enjoy the special effects and don‚Äôt set your expectations high. Jonathan Majors is going to be a great big bad in the MCU for sure."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Meh just like most of the recent MCU films that have released lately. 
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was funny and had a good story
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,So much fun! I enjoyed every second.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's most definitely not the best film in the mcu or even the ant man franchise for that matter but it's entertaining. Plus the best part about this film is the next big bad himself Kang the Conqueror played by the brilliant and talent Johnathan Majors. Played the character perfectly and came off super menacing. Can't wait for the future holds for this character
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Enjoyed it very much
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was great. Not conventional, did what guardians 2 could not pull off. Great performances. Majors is commanding, and Pfeiffer got to flex her muscles and show why she is a legend. Cassie is a great introduction that could have easily been annoying. Scott got to grow as a character, and wasn't just a joke like before.  Modok effects were the only single critique, but the creative characters in the background more than made up for it."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just another boring marvel movie. Lots of special effects, week ending. Forgettable"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. And it had no out Landish Gay scenes as usual. Great graphics.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it was better than thor love and thunder, and most marvel anything lately. some of the cgi was horrible like daren and half the time i never could tell what was wrong with the characters because they never really looked like they fit in, like you could tell they were blue screened in. but everything around them was beautiful. the jokes weren't horrible, but some were boring. the daughters acting wasn't good at all, it was like porn acting in the best way possible. my main complaint was the action, it's like they got micheal bay to direct the action scenes. it broke immersion by how quickly it would go to another shot. wasn't horrible wasn't amazing. i still enjoyed most of it.
good to watch on like a movie night."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was very entertaining and Kang is a great villain!! Per usual, critics opinions suck. Don't believe ‚Äòem, it's a ""go see"" movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Med√≠ocre, o que salva √© Jonathan Majors como Kang, mas um baita ator para um personagem desperdi√ßado. Espero v√™-lo brilhar em futuras obras como Loki temporada 2, e Vingadores: Dinastia Kang. A cena p√≥s cr√©dito √© de arrepiar e j√° apresenta o n√≠vel de perigo que Aquele que Permanece cita em Loki. 4/10"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"(With help from ChatGPT). I can confidently say that Quantumania is a must-see movie for fans of Marvel, Quantum, and Star Wars. The film seamlessly blends the three universes in a visually stunning and creatively engaging manner. The humor is classic Marvel, offering well-timed and clever jokes throughout the movie. It's a masterpiece that's sure to leave comic book nerds feeling satisfied and delighted. From start to finish, the film takes you on a journey filled with action, adventure, and humor, keeping you entertained all night. Overall, Quantumania is a delightful movie that's sure to make you smile and leave you feeling pleased."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"People hating on this movie for no reason it's definitely one of the best marvel movies released since endgame, this movie just opened a whole new potential for the upcoming marvel movies, it's a must watch if you're excited for what's coming next"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Non-stop action once the team gets sucked in to the Quantum Realm. Michael Douglas gets his time to shine. Great introduction to the next phase of the MCU. Kang begins!!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Its alright just another Marvel movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun and full of suspense, this newest entry keeps it fresh with new locations, new villains, and a surprising new Heroine."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"J√° nao tinha grandes expectativas. Mas depois deste filme e ingresso. Meu deus! Que filme ruim. P√©ssimo. Piadas realmente n√£o funcionam e nao agradam. Atores unico que se salva √© o Kang meu ponto de vista. 
Parece que dentro da receita marvel e proibido ser creativo. S√≥ pode!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,everything was amazing in this movie
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel is going downhill with these movies. Endgame and Spider-Man were the last best movies we got. This movie was rushed and had no excitement. The humor was off on this too. Sad about this movie .
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I miss Luis. Anyways stellar movie. It really respects the Antman comics as it really shows us the amount of power a trio of people who can grow bigger and smaller has against their foes.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a solid comic book movie. I don't understand why people are so upset about it.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a good movie can't waite to see what's next
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best start to the new phase and get marvel back on their feet!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed and definitely gives a great introduction to Kang. Worth seeing in the theater because in the end you won't be disappointed.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"For the most part it was pretty good. My issues are 1.) The script was only three fourths as good as it could've been and its not that it needed more to it, it's more like certain line could've been replaced with better ones and 2.) The acting was also about three fourths as good as it could've been. Apart from those two things, I found the film fairly enjoyable."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Long drawn out movie and just not into it. More
Of a stay home movie night movie , not 56 worth of a night . Like all the other ant man movies but this one .. not a fan"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best way to start kang dynasty
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"For the most part I liked the movie.  The acting was good.  The call backs from a couple of things early in the movie were nice surprises.  The story, in my opinion, was a bit weak.  A few things, I felt went trope instead of appreciating who the character should have been.  This is particularly true of Cassie.  Some of her decisions didn't appreciate the situation she was in and she's too smart not to have appreciated the situation she was in.  Spoiler--------------------------


She shouldn't have fought to stay and fight the war.  Stupid and not the immediate priority.  Immediate priority was to get the the rest of the family and then re-evaluate the overall situation.  

Cassie's costume should have come out sooner but they wanted to make a some impact.  The situation they were in was kind of dicey so the costume coming out sooner would have made more sense. But they wanted more of an impact.  Since most were expecting her to have a uniform the wait didn't enhance the movie experience.

Why was Janet Van Dine in the deserted part of the quantum realm when she was rescued and, apparently, when she met up with Kang way back when?

The last thing that bothered me was all the death of all the quantum realm people and the houses that were live.  I know that's what war does, but I hated it here.   

Other than these things it was a Marvel movie and it was OK."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Antman and the wasp quatumania is an amazing set up for upcoming marvel's phase 5 movies. Kang is absolute vip. Visuals of quantum realm were eye capturing.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just when I thought that the MCU was going nowhere after multiple disappointments from last year's movies, along came this film. Ant Man is a refreshing film to restore my faith in the future of the MCU! Great balance of a solid dramatic storyline mixed with comedic moments that we've come to love from the first two Ant-Man films. Finally delivering on the promise given to us by the introduction of Kang in Loki, the villain of the future of MCU has officially arrived and it's going to be wild ride."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was cool they should of place Kang with a serious marvel character instead on ant man being more COMICAL it didn't fit well. But KANG IS A COOL VILLIAN
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is definitely a good movie. I really don't understand all the hate it gets. So far, most of the movies in phase 4 and now phase 5 had the concepts of multiverse and time travel being thrown haphazardly without any certain direction. But with this movie, I felt like the MCU is now aware of the direction it is proceeding. Unlike the last few movies, it has laid a path for the future movies to shape themselves. It sure did have a fair amount of  unnecessary characters, weak dialogues, but that doesn't justify the bad reviews the movie has garnered. This is the beginning of another wave, just like back in 2008, its foolish of us to want every movies to be at par with Endgame. This is a fresh start for multiple characters, and we need to give time, for them to grow and for us to connect with them."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,IT WAS SOOOOOOO GOOD
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible action and a good story. The new characters are amazing and a fun  to the MCU. Overall, a really solid start to phase 5 and well worth the trip to the theater to see this one on the big screen."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This Movie Is Great! Out Of This World Fun And Interesting.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Non Spoiler Review: Quantumania is a good kickoff movie for MCU's Phase 5. It has it's own sweet and bitter family dynamic with Scott and Cassie being the centre of attention. Majors stands out as Kang, story could have easily been better and I personally felt that the audience required more of Kang and his powers. 
PS: Please do wait for Mid Credits and the Post Credits scene. Rarely do these scenes are better than the movie. I was literally surprised by the grandeur of the mid credits scene."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie can't wait to see what's to come
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie great. Vintage mcu, the plot is simple but everything is there, the heroic moments, the larger connective plot and an amazing villain. Hope to see more of this and not stuff like, ""the villain is grief."" Loved it."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's best start of phase 5. And don't miss post credit scene
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This isn't like the other two Ant man movies. It loses some of the charm of its predecessors but offers something new in exchange. While some movies start slow, this movie starts weird and introduces a lot of new characters and ideas to the MCU. You have to get through that. The rest of the movie is action packed and full of surprise characters from the comics. Definitely going to need to see this again. 

Two post credit scenes."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is not bad but definitely struggles to be good. Best part of this movie is Kang. Jonathan Majors plays Kang so well that he is a great reason to watch this movie. Janet and Kang's story is a great part in this film, with having a cool twist to it. Moreover, Paul Rudd's acting doesn't seem quite promising but nonetheless was still good in the movie. Casey was horrible and rather more annoying than funny? When Casey showed pain,emotion and yelled ""dad"", I could just not care. Marvel tends to ruin cool characters for comedic relief and that's what they did with MODOK. MODOK was a joke but a funny one I guess. The CGI was not good and it felt like I could almost always tell that there was a green screen behind Ant-man. Finally, the ending was not the greatest and the writers should've went a different route in giving a reason on why everyone should fear Kang. This movie is a fun watch but can wait to be watched in the comfort of your bed."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great don‚Äôt know why all the critics are hating on it
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Kickstart to Phase 5!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very Good movie for introducing Kang, the origin of Shang Chi's Rings, and the connection to other Kangs and Loki"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you go in with an open mind and expect something different then AntMan 1&2 , it‚Äôs marvel at its best!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visuals were quite good. Story was very clich√©, and I found myself dozing off. It had a handful of funny moments."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Admittedly grander than the previous two movies in terms of scale, stakes, and budget. But the movie offers a fun story with a great villain and visual sepctacle that may seem messy at times. Comedic timing is far better than Thor: Love and Thunder, in that it does not undercut the tension of the scenes. Character development happened for some of the characters with varying degrees. My only nitpick would be that we did not see anything new in terms of ant-man's/wasp's power sets. The shrinking and enlarging powers are now sort of tired, and i wish they showed something new or fresh."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was Fun! Fun! Fun! My two kids were glued to their seat! 3&8yrs, The popcorn was just the cherry on top for a great evening at the movies! Simply a great movie experience with the family! Definitely recommend this next chapter in the marvel universe!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the hate. I enjoyed the movie. It did have a couple hokey scenes, but they were fine. Solid, not exceptional."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie that gave us a promising look at Kang and the future of marvel. Very good introduction to a new set of characters and good character arcs from returning characters.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is the definition of mid. It's not quite terrible, but it's nowhere near how other movies out currently(Avatar: The Way Of Water etc.) captured the elements of perfection. The storyline was fantastic, but the execution of the storyline was other story. It could have definitely explained more about the new characters, the Quantum realm and more."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I found this movie really good! Great action scenes, jokes that stick, phenomenal actors (especially the main villain). No complaints here! We as a society should learn to be less critical and just learn to enjoy movies"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie! Sure it doesn't revolutionize superhero movies buts it's fun to watch high
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed the story line and the action. The entire cast did a fine job. look forward to seeing the sequel.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the film. I the story and the action.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie, the surprises and Kang was amazingly. The one liners were hilarious , action was intense‚Ä¶ I truly don't understand what it is exactly the ""reviewers"" are expecting that has them scoring the film poorly. 

Whole family loved it! One of the better Marvel movies to come out in some time."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,This was a pleasantly good movie. The start was really choppy and un balanced. And it made me belive the critics. But once it settled down and introduced Kang it was some of the best mcu content ever. If the movie was consistent the whole way through . Then it would be top 10 mcu. But act 1 drags it down from Amazing. To just good
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie idk why it's receiving so much hate. The critics just been greedy af after Endgame. 9/10
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ofcourse it's an antman movie featuring kang the conqueror that means the antagonist totally overshadows the hero and it's kind of okay to watch coz the story is good and every actors performance is amazing
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining but no without its quirks. Stiil a good overall movie however, and it does set a good tone for the next phase of the MCU"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing new concept of the realm. Great cliffhanger for the next movie about all of the kangs. Overall one of the best Marvel movies produced simply because of the expanded idea and character growth.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I want those 2 hours of my life back. It was almost like Marvel, Sharkboy and Lavagirl, and Star Wars all had a kid together. I'd also really like to know what was going through the writers heads when they put this on paper. The CGI reminded me of when I was 10 years old and I started my own YouTube channel to make video edits. I'm amazed that everyone involved sat in a room and agreed that this was worth releasing to the public. The lack of lightsabers and Jedi running around was the only reason I knew I wasn't watching a bad rendition of the Clone Wars. Also, the floating head thing, whack. Honestly, I'm just upset that I had to watch the movie until completion while my wife slept."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, very trippi and introduced awesome characters from the comix."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Marvel has kicked off its Phase 5 with a fun and entertaining movie. It does justice to the comic book sci-fi genre as it is exactly what it's supposed to be. A comedic protagonist and a menacing antagonist in stark contrast makes this movie a must watch. The quantum realm world building is amazing with quantum life design competitive even to Avatar and Star war franchises. Can't wait for Loki Season 2 and Kang Dynasty now!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It starts off a bit weird but gets better !! If that makes sense lol
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Not sure what critics are talking about. Great movie and overall a fun ride. Glad I saw it in theaters.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good movie. Entertaining. Kang was a fantastic Villain. I can't wait until Kang Dyansty. Amazing two post-credit scenes. I was not too fond of some scenes and some moments but overall I enjoyed the film.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not earth shattering, but entertaining  sets up the Kang Dynasty nicely"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Was really good give it a 10
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring and silly. Too much computer graphics and too predictable plot with not much creativity.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know why the critics are being clowns.  I guess they are just sick of marvel movies. I thought it was great.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is a launchpad for phase 5, and has the traditional fun/goofiness of an Ant Man film. It's kind of baffling that so many reviews have stated it's convoluted when like the first two Ant Man films, it pretty much guides you through what's going on. The second film had a device to go to the quantum realm. The first film has Scott go to the quantum realm. The third film shows us there's a device to locate people in the quantum ream (which is shown in the trailers). Taking stuff from the comic book panels and putting it into a movie is a big part of why these films have people going to watch them. If you enjoy comic books and/or rooting for characters that have the odds against them, you likely will enjoy this film."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The ending was pretty disappointing
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very strange movie. There were some good comedy scenes but what I expected.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of funny moments. The quantum zone is visually terrific. Excited to see Kang‚Äôs reoccurring role in future stories. 
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,I had some hopes but Ant man will continue to be the jokes of the marvel family smh
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie brought an Imaginative world into existence that was awesome
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Seems like now a days if Marvel movies aren't huge and epic then they aren't any good. This was a solid 85% for me. Nice start for phase 5, nice introduction for kang and what's to come. Check it out yourself. 48% is a joke, go with the audience rating."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed. Not a dull moment.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie wasn‚Äôt bad but not great. See for yourself and you be the judge. I still enjoyed it with the kids.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love Paul Rudd ,like the story and effects"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best MCU movie since End Game? Maybe the second best after No Way Home, but after starving through several terrible MCU films. This was satisfying. Great set up for the next big bad to shadow over the MCU for the next couple of years."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a pretty genuinely good movie, they could have utilized their character a bit more than they did but it was overall a good movie !"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great movie. Docked a star because Michael Pena wasn't in it.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, very entertaining, critics are out of touch."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Non-spoiler section:

It was a fun two hours that hit the right notes! It was funny but not in your face. The visuals were gorgeous. The dynamic between the characters were great. Writing could've used a little tightening but all in all, I paid a ticket to watch a fun Antman and Wasp adventure and I got exactly that, so money well spent!

Spoilers section:

What I liked:
1. The relationship between Scott and Cassie.
2. Jonathan Majors! Great emotive acting.
3. Hank and Janet's interaction.
4. Great level of humor.
5. Loved Darren as MODOK! Don't understand the hate about it.

What could've been better:
1. Why is it called Ant Man and the Wasp when it was more Ant Man, Janet, Cassie and then the Wasp?
2. There was no way the gang could have defeated Kang. No way!
3. Janet's rationale for keeping what happened in the Quantum Realm incomprehensible. If she was so afraid of Kang escaping, she would have gotten the word out minute one."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,If you're truly into Marvel swashbucklers then you'll enjoy this movie!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a decent movie not as bad as people say it is! I enjoyed it!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie did what it had to do in the form of being entertaining, but you can see that Kevin Feige is slipping and getting lazy.  He believes that the MCU is too big to fail, and that's going to come back and bite him.

With that said, Jonathan Majors, Evangeline Lily and Michelle Pfeiffer carried this movie with their performances.  Michael Douglass seemed like he had nothing to do and was on autopilot, still he was entertaining to watch.  The young lady who played Cassie Lang was boring and Bill Murray's character was a complete waste of film.  So far, the start of Phase 5 looks grim."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's better than Thor love and thunder. It's a good movie and the story line keeps you engaged. Definitely can see where marvel is headed. Humor isn't bad as everyone else is saying. If you've been a fan you'll get it. can't wait for Guardians Of the Galaxy!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,a really  fun movie. visually great and Kang is such a good villain
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was interesting from start to finish, Kang is such a great asset to the MCU. Can not wait for what is to come!! Good job Marvel 5 stars"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very feel good movie, good improvement for the MCU in general! Story was good and the new characters all got a chance to stand out in unique ways."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Remember to look out for the little guy"". There are chuckle worthy Paul Rudd moments but it's far too rare. The film has zero jokey, fun, pop music driven action. The father daughter bond is warmly explored as Cassie Lang (Newton)find her feet as a hero and is mentored (realistically) by her dad and family. Family doesn't give up on each other, is a big theme. Newton is a fantastic and charismatic choice for Cassie. She will be huge for this MCU phase. I like the film because it is a big chunk of Marvel's next phase, but there are are about 5 dead points in the film that jolt and confuse the viewer, making it not as immersive as it could be.  I left Thor Love and Thunder radiant and joyful. I Left Quantummania meh and talking about how unsettling Darren was."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible writing. Boring story line.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was everything I wanted to see in the full unveiling of Kang! I didn't even worry about what I saw coming from critics because all they do is cry about how Marvel is killing ""cinema"" every time another movie comes out. Well critics can suck it because this movie killed it. It was packed full of action and lore and it was funny just like you would expect from Ant Man!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I feel like a lot of people want tough, cynical movies full of grit and consequences. The words I hear most often when reading the reviews of this movie are Low stakes and bland. I couldnt care less about the stakes, and it wasnt bland. Too many people have become wine glass swishing, nose-upturning, boundary-pushing Statlers and Waldorfs. I find it especially odd that this movie apparently didnt take enough bold risks in their eyes, and was therefore formulaic, as if the constant bold risk-taking in many Marvel films isnt formulaic in its own right.

I like Marvel movies and Marvel characters. I want to see more of their stories. This delivered for me. The premise was simple, but the product was satisfying. Im tired of the uniformity of what I perceive to be an amateur film critic edginess contest."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a movie in a different direction. When Thanos was introduced, it was a slow process. Kang was introduced in this movie right out of the gate. It was not perfect and it's good enough for my money."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Walked in wanting Kang to CONQUER and he's conquering AND I NEED MORE!!!! GIVE ME KANG DYNASTY!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome start for the Phase 5 in MCU, despite certain plot twist seems abit too random. All the graphics and the acting are very on place ( expt for Kathryn Newton, sorry but her expression at the climax part seems abit too ... calm? ) , definitely a MUST WATCH in MCU."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie. Not sure why it's getting so much hate. Can't wait to see what the dynasty looks like in future instalmments.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was a good, run of the mill Marvel movie.  Not sure why the critics hate on it so much.  Let's keep expectations in check, not every Marvel movie is going to be Endgame.  Jonathan Majors was awesome as Kang."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Stay for the two end credit scenes !
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was good and I got what I was expecting from an ANTMAN movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was entertaining but I didnt like the ending.  I liked the story arch of the quantum realm.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great build for the Kang Saga. I'm excited to see how this progresses!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this was an awesome movie. Not perfect but enjoyable.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very little story, good thing Paul Rudd is funny"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the third movie in the Ant-Man series, I have seen the other two and this one is by far the most serious one, still have some comedy here and there, the movie is really entertaining. Paul Rudd is back as Ant-Man, and this time he's teaming up with Evangeline Lilly as the Wasp, as they explore the quantum realm even more. The movie has a new villain, played by Jonathan Majors, and it looks like he's going to be a tough opponent for our heroes. But with plenty of humor, action, and heart, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania promises to be a fun adventure that fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe won't want to miss!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the Star Wars vibe, strange creatures and world building.  A very fast moving movie before you know it you are on the third act.  Yes, Modok is silly but I don't know what else could be done - it's a flowing head with weapons - my theater bust out laughing every time he show up. Kang is fantastic - he is serious villain and nobody dares to make jokes around him."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Marvels is great as usual.  Fun and action packed with great effects.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love the antman franchise. This is one of the better number 3 movies marvel has done! The visual effects were amazing, and Johnathan Majors delivered a fantastic performance. Loved the story line. A win for marvel.....much needed after Tahiti's recent Thor."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the comedy, the acting, and the introducing of Kang the new villain."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A good movie with better CGI than phase 4 ‚Äòs movie
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,good movie. does a fairly decent job setting up the next phase of Marvel movies.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Based on a lot of previous negative comments I really went to see this with low expectations.  Boy was I surprised.  Really liked the movie.  My wife and grand-kids also really liked the movie.  I would recommend this if asked.  Not the best of the Marvel movies but pretty good in my estimation.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,A lot happens but it never actually feels like the heros are in danger. You never feel emotionally invested. Lots of action. Solid story but....
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It‚Äôs an attack on the Lord Jesus Christ. The God of Eternity, who sits outside of time. For those who have ears, listen."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Throughly enjoyed! Great mix of funny and entertainment. They fixed what was missing in the last few marvel projects. Great effects and action scenes. So excited for what Kang will bring to the upcoming films/shows.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. So much better than it shoulda been. It should be to weird to work, but it does anyway!! It is a Kirbyesque comic book come to life and it isn't just fanboy fizzle the story also has heart and a payoff to rival an Avengers movie. The aliens were unbelievable and as anyone who has ever read a micro verse comic this was right on target! F**k I kept waiting for the micronauts to come out of the woodwork. 86%"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie feels a lot like a Flash Gordon flick...And not in a good way.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had a great time!  This movie was fun, exciting, and creative.  The universe that was created was beautiful  fantastic and original.  Will watch this again!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE MOVIE ... WOW WOW WOW
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant Man: Quantimania is a decent but not very good compared to others. I think a lot of hope was laid on Quantimania's shoulders due to Phase 4 being not very good, and this movie turned out alright. Gets boring at times, and Kamg seems less powerful than he is said to be. But the movie is pretty good at times, and it is a good family watch. Not comparing to other movies, tho."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too long to get to the story. Too campy.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best of the 3 Ant-Man movies. Has a family style heart that I hope the MCU uses if they bring FF back into the mix. Good fresh new Marvel characters, and Kang is definitely going to be a force to face in the future. If you're a dad with a daughter it very relatable and you will love it."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Predictable and requires no audience buy in.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It starts kinda strange but keep watching! It is incredible and very well done! Many heartfelt moments. I absolutely loved it!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Its a one time watch move. Terrible animation and storyline.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Definitely a different movie. Gets pretty slow at some parts. I don't know why they didn't cut a bit more out of it. A lot of funny parts where Paul Rudd shines in.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, spectacular performance from Jonathan major. The critics are dumb, don't listen to them"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst Marvel movie in ages & disappointing since I liked the first Ant Man movie. The whole budget must have gone to the special effects with no thought into the script or plot development.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie isn't perfect but it is a great movie to watch and it will definitely make me want to go watch it again in the future. The movie is so much fun. one thing I can really say about the film is the way it plays out will be unique to the MCU.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the movie but I didn‚Äôt like a few things. First I liked how they kept the comedy feel of the other antman movies. I didn‚Äôt like how Hopes mom was keeping the secret of kang from everyone kinda annoying. I‚Äôm glad Paul Rudd didn‚Äôt die but I was hoping they showed the dominance of kang and maybe killed a few main characters. Overall I think they did a good job starting phase 5.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,First movie to watch in the theatres in such a long time! It was visually stunning and had quite the assortment of comedic characters.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Loved the first one, thought the second was 'ok', but I found 3 to be boring, tedious, and the plot incoherent."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are stupid. Fun movie, very entertaining Lots of good action."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is just ok - unfortunately. The MCU has become just like any other studio where you expect to see good and bad movies. The friends and family process Feige is using needs to be blown up and bring in new internal people to review his projects.  This is the first time my wife and two boys totally hated an MCU movie and that's saying something as they even like Thor the dark world and Eternals.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'll be honest I liked it. While what Wakanda forever was something of a flop for me this one was fun and Kang stole the show like Darth Vader walking into the ship on Star Wars episode 4.. This felt like an ant Man Movie. And that's all I could really ask after drek like she hulk tv, not the comic.  I'm not sure if this is a new Kang produced by splitting time lines after death of He Who Remains on Loki Season 1, or another left over from the first multiversal war. But he played his role well, both as a villain and a certain human vulnerability that dosent excuse what he did or plans to do, but makes you understand how human he is and how he could have arrived at this terrible fate.  Reminds me of some characters from the Fallout franchise . Would watch again.  I hope this mean mcu will finally get out of its creative slump."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Definitely had the comedic charm of the first two that come before it and still holds that essence of an Ant Man movie despite being in a totally different scenery. Speaking of which, the effects were amazing. The quantum realm as a whole was very impressive looking, though some of the effects (one villain and a couple of wild quantum realm monsters) were lacking. Overall, great entertainment for the whole family. Just be warned, this movie tends to lean heavily more on the sci-fi."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are sandbagging this movie to the point of collective negging it.  It was much better than the abysmal score given.  I'm not even sure this cast could do that poorly under any circumstances.  

The known characters are good.  Cassie is a player now and started to show who she was.  Majors is rolling and is great.  Looking forward to seeing him again in Loki 2.  If you're an mcu fan you will like it.  If you aren't the star power will shine for you as long as you are ok with sci fi/action.  Didn't give it a 5 because it wasn't a 5 but it's a solid 4."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,CGI was okayish but storyline sucked. This moved just lacked alot of elements and it was trying to get cheap laughs every chance it could.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its an ant man film, it's supposed to be fun, sure the plot at times feels wack and corny, but one can enjoy it. I'm just here to be entertained and it did do that.  phase 5 looks promising!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too heavy on the CGI, not enough clever writing. Overall fair."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the movie , super funny. Very beautiful effects"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"While it was fun, they kept a serious tone to the action. Kang steals the show for sure."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantumania was a good adventure with all of the characters working together against Kang who was such a good character. It exceeded my expectations and those critics don't know how to rate a movie
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed, fun night out"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing it was ant man just like I imagined!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action
Visual effects"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie! Great visuals ! Majors is amazing and the rest of the cast shows up to deliver!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I did find it quite entertaining and didn't have any annoying characters trying to be relevant to the plot like the last one. Good start to Phase 5, though one must be careful to not over do it."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and lots of action right away!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,I miss the glory days of cinema.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great film in the MCU
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is a disaster.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great beginning to phase 5, beats every movie not including Spiderman in phase 4. Kang is going to be a problem! Don't listen to the expert critics that said this movie is bad, it's a very enjoyable movie thats worth the money to go see!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"With the recent Phase 4 disappointments on Disney+ & the ludicrous Thor 4, it was nice to get to enjoy a new MCU movie that wasn't trying hard. Ant-Man & The Wasp Quantumania was simple to follow, the humour was dialed down since Thor 4 & OMG was it nice. Paul Rudd still fills the suit of the Ant-Man character well & Johnathan Majors, my goodness what a performance. To me this was Kang's origin story, as like Infinity War being Thanos's. Kang had a conflicting & unsettling personality. He made himself feel vulnerable, trust worthy at times, a seemingly humble & stoic character that could reveal his darkest & most dangerous side at a moments whim, with a calm that is uncomfortable. And with all his strengths & domineering presence he still felt vulnerable. A different villain altogether from the pantheon of MCU villains before. I enjoyed the film for what it was & see it for what it's meant to be. It's one of the better films post Endgame, & seriously don't believe the critics. Take a gander & enjoy your distraction from our superhero-less world."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critic reviews are way off here, is this Endgame level good? Of course not, but for those following the MCU and the backstory, this was a meaningful step forward setting up Kang as the big bad, tying together previous threads, all with stunning visuals and typical Ant-Man charm. Granted, some areas for improvement and some comedy in moments that called for seriousness, similar to Ragnarok. Overall, though, a great MCU instalment, becoming more and more for those who understand and follow the storyline."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a little goofy but I enjoyed it
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,lots of action for sure. Hard to understand about the quantum realm. I did not understand what all that was about. May have to see it a few more time to bring it all together.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie really...even from the absurd Dr strange movie plot, though I enjoyed No way Home, I decided to pass on black panther after it's janky trailer, purely because I don't want it to taint my 1st Black panther experience, fortunately I was right from all the reviews. Mission accomplished. 
But let's get back to Quantumania. The first Antman was very much fun to watch, however this one I was yawning nonstop and kept looking at my watch. Rarely a movie made me do so.
The end climax was so lackluster, that the build up went directly down the drain. Such a pity...
Coz they clearly spent more budget on the visual rather than the story content, shame really. 
The main takeaway and saving grace of this whole movie is Michelle Pfeiffer's magnificent performance. 
Antman's kids was so unbearable for crying out loud!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's not nearly as bad as the internet is screaming about.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great visuals of the microverse and good acting all around.  I enjoyed this movie a lot.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie can't wait for Kang dynasty
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, entertaining. It finally starts to build up the next avengers film , the mcu felt scattered and this film starts to tie things together again"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Was a pretty decent movie. Not sure where the hate is coming from. Best parts of the movie were with Janet and Kang. I liked all of the main cast including new comer Cassie.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great setup for the next marvel phase. A lot of fun!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a good movie definitely more serious than the other ant mans. I missed Luis we needed his commentary.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie. Visuals were great and the story line kept me interested. This movie was excellent.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it and had a lot of fun!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie just lacks in 1st half slow story at start but 2nd half is awesome loved movie very much KANG
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it !!     Right amount of action and laughs !!!    Can‚Äôt wait to see where Kang takes us.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a very fun film. What I would call a cool sci-fi adventure ride.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Since the Endgame, Marvel continues to go downhill.  This is more of a Disney movie than a true Marvel production.  Funny because Michelle Pheifer and Paul Rudd are two of my favorites but this was poorly written and directed.  What a joke for such a big production!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The plot is solid; there's character development, intrigue, and an epic ending. CGI can improve."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics are all idiotic. This movie was 7 times better than Dr. Strange 2. When people say that modoc was silly make no since. What would a giant head look like then. Kang was a good villain and the rest of the cast was on point. Marvel did their thing again
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Don‚Äôt know what to say, marvel‚Ä¶ get it together"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, forget all of these film critics looking for certain aspects of what they think is a good film. If you are a Marvel fan, I can almost guarantee you enjoyed this movie. Jonathon Majors as kang was incredible! I personally loved the movie I believe it had it's flaws like every movie, I think some are being too harsh, but it pleased the fans, that's all you can ask for."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good movie! Plot very similar to Tron Legscy.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Sets up next years of marvel perfectly.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not as great as we were hoping, but not as bad as everyone is saying.  This movie is definitely a movie to rewatch.  Kang and Janet were the all stars of this movie.  When it's just the two of them on screen that's when the movie is at its best.  Kang is not Thanos level yet, but Jonathan Majors talent is undeniable and he's definitely incredible in playing this character.  Kang still needs to grow and with time he'll get there and become better then all the villains we've had before."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Johnathan Majors is looking to be a bad ass villain as Kang.  One of the best villains in the AntMan franchise.

Really not a bad film compared to AntMan 2"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Weakest mcu movie i have seen in a while. Kang was amazing but everything else felt out of place.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The mcu is becoming a shell of its former self, and if antman 3 made you think there was any hope for a promising new phase, you'll be very mistaken.

Kang may be he only interesting character in this film, as he felt like if The Master from Doctor Who became his own Timelord Victorious. 

Unfortunately, the rest of the film felt cringey, formulaic, and tone deaf from its snide comments of revolution, socialism, and other small details that don't bode well coming from Disney in 2023 with their own slave wages.

(Spoiler) M.O.D.O.K was such an embarrassment that I had to avert my eyes from him during the latter half of the film.

Way too much forced humor. All the production value was put into the visuals, and not much of the writing.

I saw more excitement and energy from the audience around me with the second post credit scene then the whole movie. 

Do better, Feige!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie was good but marvel need to cut the unnecessary comedy stuff because it really takes out the seriousness of the movie, the movie had really good part in the story line."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in unsure with my wife but we had a great time this movie was visually stunning, very comic booky with a fantastic villain and we loved the family dynamic of the characters. It was ridiculously entertaining. We want to see it again in IMAX"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie overall. Perfectly sets up 2 future MCU projects.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a great movie. Kang is HIM!!! Being a life long marvel fan I am happy with the start of Phase 5.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Again, Marvel put together another amazing story that would seem far fetched, but makes it possibility. I enjoyed the visuals and the acting from the main characters. Holding back the past kept the storyline going and was a great segway into the 2nd half of the movie. 
Marvel continues to build upon the structure they created to tie multiple characters and movie franchises together to create the immense universe that is Marvel."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie. Lang was poised as a great villain. It just lacks Ant Man it felt we didn't get to see any man type of stuff like the last movies. But considering he's the only one who could've got to quantum realm it makes sense why he was chosen as the hero to really introduce kang. P.s. it's a all Sylvies fault.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,very good movie.  a lot of action.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Johnathan Majors was cast perfectly
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is criminally underrated. From the review score, I thought I was going to be disappointed just like with Thor Love and Thunder. This movie was way better."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"beautiful movie, the action was solid too"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie.  worth the watch.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"it's a great movie with breathtaking action scenes, good effects but the humor part didn't work, few jokes were funny and the ending of M.O.D.O.K. it was ridiculous. Jonathan's performance as Kang was very good, he showed what he came for."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great time at the movies! Married all the heart and humor of previous Ant-Man films with an epic scale and stakes. Loved the addition of Kathryn Newton as Cassie, and Jonathan Majors is incredible as Kang. Also really enjoyed Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer as Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne -- I'd love to see Marvel do a flashback movie, feature presentation, or show about their time as the Ant-Man and Wasp of the 60's!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was much better than the recent Thor movie. Was funny but not overly funny and dumb like Thor. Felt more like the old marvel instead of this new marvel they are doing
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome start to finish. No stupid comedy gimmicks and nonsense characters. Loved it and can't stand the critics reviews. This isn't your world take a hike high and mighty!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good action, snappy dialogue. Cant wait to see how Loki fits into it. Needs more Paul Rudd. My daughter liked Ryan Bergera"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this movie so much, the intensity and change of time compared to other ant man films. 
Seeing first glance of Kang was a great intro to capability. Is this film perfect, of course not. But let's not compared this to civil war or infinity war.

The visuals are great. Didn't feel slow at all.
I was very pleased with how it ended."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Do not believe the biased movie critics. This movie was very good and everyone in it was on point. The only concern I have is Marvel is not rolling out Kang in a menacing way like they did with Thanos.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to anyone, movie was good."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely not as bad as the critic said! Me and my wife had a great time!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,I had fun watching the movie. A good quality popcorn flick to allow my brain to go into cruise control and not have to worry about anything for a couple of hours.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, don't understand why people are calling this a ""lackluster"" or ""exhaustive"" film, and I feel as though a lot of reviews are symptoms to superhero fatigue more so than critiques of the movie itself. This film felt like a good jumping off point into the second overarching arc in the MCU, where you don't need to be familiar with every previous movie and real world events to keep up. The movie is lighter on comedy and focuses more on personal relationships and building up the next major villain, and I find that to be a good thing. Many people (including me) complained that Marvel movies felt stale and forced with quips and one liners every other scene, so seeing a more intense movie within the franchise felt like a good change of pace. I wouldn't say the movie is without it's flaws, but it didn't feel as though there were plot holes and inconsistencies large enough to hold entire universes within them. The movie felt dark visually as well for a few scenes (not nearly as dark as the DCEU), but this did make some of the mind-bending visuals get lost easily. Overall, it was just fun."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"More like Quantum-MEH-nia. It had a few decent laughs, but there were just too many moments where I had to question who okayed some of the decisions. There were some quite bad CGI moments. The story dragged on so much that the two hour runtime felt so much longer. The second end credit scene was probably the thing that got me the most excited"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel fans need to realize that not every movie is going to be an infinity war/endgame level movie. Good plot, lots of action, and funny characters. Movie is a great intro to the Kang Dynasty and can't wait for more of Kang"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is when Ant-Man meets Star-Wars during MadMax in Honey I Shrunk the Kids‚Ä¶ but all-in-all, still feels like all the other Ant üêú man films. If I will say that this is an Ant-man Avenger level movie. Very entertaining, not overly flooded with comedy, but staying grounded when it needs to be. Jonathan Majors knocked it out of the park‚Ä¶ his performance as KANG was EVERYTHING!!! Michelle Pfeiffer stole the show!!! She was amazing. Loved Kathryn Newton as Cassandra Lang, loved her sub-story with her father, really love the message in which she brought too. Don‚Äôt know too much about M.O.D.O.K., but I thought his character was great but cgi was weird. That being said overall visually it was stunning and the music score was on point. I was pretty fired up towards the end of movie and the post credit scene had me WANTING MORE!!! I felt great leaving the movies, and want to watch it again. I give the movie 8 or 9 rating out of 10. I wish they had more of Kang!!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is just the beginning of whats to come. Loved it absolutely.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I always love Antman, this movie did not disappoint, enjoyed the adventure through the quantum realm."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was the best of the 3 ant man movies and a really good Kang introduction.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action and tied into the storyline
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,My son & I thought it was full of action & loved the ending!! Cant wait for the next Ant Man
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was just more of the same thing: all the marvel movies have the same theme. Theres a bad, kill the bad guy, but he gets away to come back."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Es una pel√≠cula que no tiene una motivaci√≥n direcci√≥n definida, que carece de emociones y argumentos. Se pude apreciar con facilidad como en su totalidad es una cinta forzada, que no muestra un interesante desarrollo de personajes ni un bueno arco argumental.
Palabras m√°s palabras menos, est√° pel√≠cula no est√° a la altura."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"While this movie was not perfect, I still found it very enjoyable. It was a fun sci-fi adventure that set up the threat of knag very well with Jonathan Major's fantastic performance and evolved antman as a character in a way that I thought was very fitting. It also develops other characters very well as well. I do feel that Bill Murray was wasted and the VFX were spotty in some spots, but overall, if you like sci-fi adventures, there is a high chance you will enjoy this film."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've got no problem with critics giving this the ratings they did.  If you're a professional movie critic, you've got to keep up a certain level of sophistication, and rating superhero movies favorably isn't the way to do that.  Superhero movies certainly have their place, I'm not knocking them, but they're not Casablanca.  

So how have these same critics turned in favorable review after favorable review on most of the past Marvel movies?  It seems they were using a different set of criteria for those movies than they would for serious cinema.  Now, all of a sudden, they're switching back to the standard rating system?

I saw no difference between Quantumania and other favorably rated Marvel movies.  This one was just as good as the other two Antman films, and any of the other movies that I've seen. Highly entertaining, and in the same spirit as the first two, this Antman is exactly what you'd hope for.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and, using a scale geared towards superhero films, I give it 4.5/5.

Luis should have been back though.  I read something where the director said they just couldn't find a way to work him in.  Well, they found a way to work in a walking/talking piece of broccoli, so I feel bringing back a central character from the first two movies shouldn't be all that long of a stretch.  But other than that, two thumbs up.  Go see it, if you haven't already."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie and great special effects
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was terrible, a Star Wars rip off if there was one, Ant Man is not a good franchise for Marvel it‚Äôs actually the worst of the marvel franchises "
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A cool flick, a solid Marvel, but the charm of the previous Ant Man movies was missed. This sets up the overall story moving forward and Jonathan Majors shines as he always does. Cant wait to see him in future Marvel things."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I really really really love the movie but I really I have loved to have seen Ant-Man and the wasp Kiss at the ending 
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena pel√≠cula, hay que tomar en cuenta cada detalle de las pel√≠culas anteriores y tambi√©n de esta ya que eso lo hace a√∫n mejor.
¬°Muero por ver al Kang: nivel vengadores!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome and exactly what I expected.  I don't know what the critics expect when watching a Marvel movie but this was great.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,No continuing storyline. Too much going on. No focus on character. Another Marvelous flop!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly it wasn't too bad i liked some of the jokes and it was funny here and there but in some moments it just wasn't it not going to lie. I also loved the second post credit scene. It was good. Overall 7.8/10.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too much CGI. A little choppy Johnathan Majors was easily the best part of the movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Definitely some annoying social commentary ‚Äî when Douglas mentioned socialism, the entire theater laughed At him! LOL at least the audience wasn‚Äôt buying it ‚Äî yawn. And homeless people in SF absolutely need to cleared out, as they have a majority mental illness and are a danger to themselves and public at large. Feces app anymore? No reason they should be able to do illegal acts while others doing the same would be arrested for same, and no way they should take over all the public retreats within a city like nice parks. Better than Thor and dr strange more recently ‚Äî but still not amazing. Some pretty great scenes in ScreenX. I enjoyed it, but will likely never watch again. "
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining. The end is a little bit too much!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome. Cassie is a great addition and Jonathan Majors as Kang is amazing. Outside of how Scott and Hope get back this was a great movie!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding film with outstanding special effects.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a fun movie. I enjoyed it. Great start to phase 5
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You can say a thousand things about this movie, I think there is no flaw that I can say that hasn't already been said, but I can tell you something, I had to turn my brain off to enjoy the movie. that's all"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Looks amazing! Paul Rudd and cast made another Marvel great.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie from start to finish perfectly pasted, it was funny when it needed too and the movie has got me more excited for what comes next, also very curious too see if the MCU is going too do the backstory of kang for the comic or switch it up a little I 100% can't wait to see what the MCU do next"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a great movie, good to see Kang on screen.
Don't trust critics score this is best Antman movie and one of the best Antman movie the visuals are also great"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the critics it's clear this is part of the MCU and anyone who doesn't realize that is fooling themselves or lives  under a rock.  This was a good movie.  It had the graphics it had a decent story it had action and it has a scary new villain.  I thought it all worked out well.  It was nice to give Ant Man and the Wasp legitimate villains this go around.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was REALLY fun. I enjoyed the sci-fi nature of it. It's a completely different tone from the first 2 Ant-Man movies but still enjoyable. Despite having diminished roles in this movie compared to the previous 2, Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lily played their roles admirably. Another solid performance from Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Michelle Pfeiffer was phenomenal and JONATHAN MAJORS IS THAT DUDE! Excited to see what else he brings as Kang! 8.5/10"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable movie, a good watch, Majors does great job"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Paul Rudd has never sat well with me as a casting choice. The un-woke casting of the 5 main characters of this series haven't been the billion dollar deliverers like the other sub-franchises.

I don't think this movie would've been nearly as entertaining if I wasn't partying before going."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visually beautiful most of the time. Felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie, though. But pretty good."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I really like this ant man movie it one of the best and best the action was really good you must see this movie I get it 100% must see in theaters marvels did a good job and the actors where the best and the story behind it was really good how they show the people from the first and second ant man movie
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Our entire family really enjoyed this movie. Paul Rudd did a tremendous job with this and the addition of Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer were perfect elements to make it hilarious, thrilling, and heartwarming all at the same time. I think this is the perfect family movie with so many great dialogue moments and epic action scenes. We were all pleased with this movie-going event and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. 

Michael Douglas' character was probably the best in my opinion though I did really like the element of him with Michelle Pfeiffer the way they played off each other was perfectly executed."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie. Some great plot, funny scenes, and character development. It is a pure version of the Hero's Journey. Johnathan Majors kills it as Kang and Kathryn Newton shines as Cassie Lang."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,movie kinda sucked but paul rudd is still hot so
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had a wonderful blend of incredible creativity, great storytelling: introducing Kang, deepening the family dynamics as well as amazing action. My friends and I had a blast watching it! I'm looking forward to seeing it again."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, action, good story."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! If you‚Äôre an MCU fan, it‚Äôs great."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"First act was great, second act fell flat"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Overall, I found it to be boring and formulaic. For the most part, I didn't find any of it to be exciting, I though the first & second ant man movie were much better. The comedy wasn't nearly as bad as Thor love and thunder where there was way too much comedy, but it still had the standard mcu comedy throughout the movie that compromises some scenes. However, I can't remember actually laughing much either, the action also was decent in some areas but nothing that interesting. But, main that was that I just felt like everything was mcu formulaic, quippy throughout, another cgi world, a bunch of faceless minions that are used for fodder, end of the movie massive cgi battle. In the end, I feel like this movie was a great example of what's wrong with marvel movies right now, instead of focusing on smaller stakes, which is what ant-man typically is about, it has to get larger than life, saving some world we were just introduced to, and just existing to keep churning out marvel movies and moving to the next phase or mcu goal. In the end, I left the theatre feeling meh and disappointed it wasn't as good as the previous movies. I can't say I actively hated it, but I was so uninterested as I watched it"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,About the same as any other recent Marvel movie
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie! Kang was weaker than I expected, but Im still exited for what more this new dynasty has to offer!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,By far the best Ant-Man out the trilogy!! Great start kicking off Phase 5. This one had a darker tone than the 2 previous entries with slight humor never fully taking away from the seriousness and KANG!!... talk about a legit MCU villain entrance can't wait to see him again in future Marvel movies!! Critics don't know a thing about good entertainment and what the audience wants don't listen to their crap or read their stuff.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This 3rd installation of Ant-Man has a more serious tone which I really liked. And this makes it the best Ant-Man film yet!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing movie got me thinking about the tech that the movie used wonder if the tech is in the real world now but still an amazing movie with plenty of laughs.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and just keep making them interesting. Mind blowing movie
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kinda seemed pointless for the overall MCU story. At least we got to see Kang.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,We love you Ant-Man!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was good. Sets up for next phase..
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"AMAZING. PHENOMENAL. CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE.
I truly did not think I'd like this movie as much as I did. Not only did it exceed my expectations, but lived up to (if not MORE) than the hype around it. Visuals were 5/5 stars, Comedic feel was 5/5, the overall storyline was done SO well. It was the best way to enter and introduce phase 5 of the Marvel cinematic universe. Way to GO."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely enjoyed it! Wished the theater had some leg room.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was great. A fun ride. Kang was amazing. Can't wait for the next in the series.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie felt weirdly paced at the start but was better for the rest of the movie definitely a great starting point for Phase 5 who ever reviewed this as a bad movie is definitely wrong
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"good acting, especially Jonathan Majors as Kang. cool action, a bit Star wars-like.  much more serious than the first two Ant Man movies.  stay for the mid and post credit scenes."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Utter bore. Fails to draw any emotive connection with the cast. Everyone is dull, boring, dud. Paul Rudd what happened? 
Time for a reset."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,We loved the slime guy
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Be prepared for the Quantum Realm to be weird. Other than that, it was a nice intro to Kang and the threats that they pose."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! Absolute recomended
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it. Fun to meet up with these characters on an amazing adventure. The CGI looked fantastic. Can't wait to see where the MCU goes after this with Kang.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great intro for Phase 5!!! Hope to see more Kang!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,loved it !!!! Best Ant-Man yet!!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Some parts were clever, plot and acting were decent."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Unfortunately, not very special. Kang was great, but the rest was uninteresting. I did not care for the aliens or their situation. The mid credit scene is worth it though, they should make a movie about that."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow this was a great third installment it did not disappoint. Very action packed and cinematography was amazing. Loved every bit of this movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie üé¨ must watch. stay till the end.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great start to phase 5, really pleased with Kang. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie to start phase 5‚Ä¶
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,fun popcorn muncher.  great intro into this chapter
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"No real surprises here.  if you are a MCU completist, you should go see it.  the trailer pretty much spells out the plot.  Paul Rudd is always good for a laugh.  Jonathan Majors is am amazing actor."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it! I don't get the MCU complaints. This was an Ant-man movie with a nice dose of Kang. It's clearly just the beginning of this journey. Went to see it as a family. The kids were entertained. The humor had a nice balance and the acting was decent. Is it Oscar worthy no but it's a good time at the theater and not at work. Bonus points for Jonathan Majors!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Much better than the mess of the second one. Probably mid-tier of the Marvel movies but it seems like the story flowed well enough.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, definitely better than love and thunder or wakanda forever
The acting was good. The special effects were very cool . Definitely worth seeing"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,movie gets going right from the start .Good acting..incredible special effects
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a well done Ant Man movie. This is where it is ok to be silly. Kang was awesome... can't wait for more. Will say that I would have liked some more character time in the quantum realm ...but just go for a fun film... Critics need to chill out
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing film, with a lot of heart. Filled with beautiful scenes, some classic MCU humor, and some pretty great fight scenes. Johnathan Majors was incredible as Kang"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining movie!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania 
Posso descreve-lo como um √©pico pensate multidimensional universal. O filme √© o melhor filme do Star Wars desde Despertar da For√ßa. Desculpem o trocadilho entre franquias, mais o tempo do filme escorre entre os dedos. Primeira hora do filme √© um alto e aprofundado explicativo da vis√£o da Janet e a segunda parte com uma a√ß√£o fant√°stica. Destaque para o Michael Douglas e a Michelle Pfeifer roubam a cena com tranquilidade, mas Jonathan Majors √© simplesmente incr√≠vel, dando vida ao *Menor dos seus iguais* j√° mostra o que esperar..."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, but not as engaging as other Avenger movies."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"√â bom, n√£o √© uma obra prima, mas cumpre o que promete"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow. Just wow. If they tried to make a worse movie they couldn‚Äôt. It was Spy Kids mixed with a high school production of Star Wars. Terrible acting, awful story, ridiculous stories. Shoulda watched velocipastor again instead of that pile of trail apples."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely a step-up from the trilogy's second entry. I had a lot of fun watching this film: the world-building, the strong emphasis on family and the parallels between Scott and Janet and how their choices impact those around them, and a treachery in a villain I haven't felt from a Marvel villain in awhile. Sure, it has its flaws (humor that undermines dramatic moments, underutilized actors in side roles), but those are nitpicks. Quantumania is a strong end to a consistent trilogy of heist films focused on family. I'm genuinely curious as to why critics are hating on this film, but I want to see where the general public stands in the next few years."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well I loved the movie, and I think it's a great comeback for Marvel after thor love and thunder...
For more please have a look:- 
https://aarcflick.blogspot.com/2022/12/ant-man-and-wasp-quantumania-2023-movie.html"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"At no point during the entire run time did I feel an emotion I didn‚Äôt entirely expect, the jokes were funny, and the dramatic scenes, and the fight scenes, etc. I found myself rooting for the villain the entire movie, Jonathan majors saved the entirety of whatever I just watched"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania was an amazing movie that I would rate 9/10 overall. The VFX was incredible, bringing the concepts of the quantum world to life. The story was also excellent, and the post-credit scene sets up the Kang Dynasty. Don't let low reviews deter you, this movie is a must-see. 

Just be prepared to never look at broccoli ü•¶  the same way again!ü§£

Thanks, Marvel, for an incredible journey into the quantum realm. Looking forward to what's next!
Let me know your thoughts in the comments."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure I understand the criticism. Since the beginning of Phase 4 until now, I think this is the 2nd or 3rd best film."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie had alot of action but the emotional touch just wasn't there. But all in all good story line and tons of great effects.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A great introduction to Kang, deeper look into the quantum realm, and the visuals were awesome."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Good visual effects. Very direct storyline. Lack of surprises or emotional scenes. Gags not made you laugh here. Beginning part just show off visual effects. Middle part quite annoying. Ending part is disappointing. Waiting for extended version or uncut. Hope it far more better than theaters. End credits mainly for Kang on sequential movies.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I loved the original Ant Man, but this one has lost the magic. No desire to watch it again."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is a fun movie to go see. Definitely worth going to the Theatres to see it (I went to the Real3D showing) and the visuals were incredible. They did a good job developing Kang and how cruel and powerful he is. Keep in mind that the Ant-Man franchise is the comedic arm of the MCU and this one is pretty funny. There is a tad long of a lull in the middle of the film but overall it flows very very well. There were some characters that are kind of a bummer that they won't be in anymore movies but you get that in every movie so it's all good. Come for the action, stay for the humor and by all means stay to past the credits."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was boring. Period.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Roteiro cheio de buracos personagens cansativos e perdidos na hist√≥ria o √∫nico que se salva √© o Kang mas o filme √© do homem-formiga
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just another cartoonish movie :)
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing I cant wait to see what is next. Worth the watch
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I found the movie enjoyable. Sure, there were parts that felt were rushed or felt kind of weird but that's what this film is supposed to be about. Jonathan Majors' portrayal of Kang is great and I'm looking forward to see more of his variants in the future. Hank Pym was the spotlighted hero for me. Michael Douglas did great. M.O.D.O.K was a great addition but I wanted more of him. Overall, it was a great film, a great start to Phase 5, and a film I had fun going to the theater for. 8/10 for me!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,started a little slow but picked up quickly.   can't wait to see where this will go.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a solid movie it could have used a different ending and Kang was kind of weak in the movie and model should not have died he could have made a big difference in marvel but Kang Carrie's the movie and I recommend watching it
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me and my wife loved this movie. The visuals are fantastic. Kang is amazing and really sets the tone for the future to come. There was still humor just not as much, but that makes sense. It has some faults but the movie was thoroughly enjoyable and a great popcorn movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's finally time for the Conquerer! Kang is absolutely glorious! His presence alone makes Quantumania a must watch for all MCU fans! Is this a perfect film? Unfortunately, no. We are 31 films in‚Ä¶not all of them can be #1. But it's a truly entertaining sci-fi trippy ride from start to finish. A few awkward moments, maybe a plot hole here or there‚Ä¶but you've certainly got to suspend your disbelief in major ways entering a world where we're talking about a QUANTUM REALM‚Ä¶and that's the worst thing I can say about this experience. But‚Ä¶KANG!! Just‚Ä¶wow! Jonathan Majors is killing it right now‚Ä¶I cannot wait to see what he does next on his exciting and terrifying journey to the Kang Dynasty! Every single moment he's on screen, his performance is simply mesmerizing, and often frightening! Rudd is delightful and fun as always, and Newton was charming as our adult Cassie. Setting up more Young Avengers with her Stinger persona, for sure‚Ä¶would love to see her team up with the likes of Kate, America, etc‚Ä¶ Pfeiffer steals every scene she's in, no surprise there‚Ä¶and Douglas proves why no one should ever underestimate Hank Pym. Lilly was‚Ä¶criminally underused‚Ä¶I'll admit. And M.O.D.O.K. is‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶as good as he can possibly look in live action! A few surprises, some classic MCU humor, lots of heart, and insanely impressive visual effects. There's nothing boring about this film. Be sure you stay for BOTH post credit scenes, especially if you're a fan of ALL recent and upcoming MCU projects. That's all I'll say in order not to spoil‚Ä¶but, trust me. Many promises of exciting things to come! So‚Ä¶overall‚Ä¶I think Quantumania gets a 7/10 from me. Definitely not the PERFECT start to Phase 5 I was hoping it would be‚Ä¶certainly full of a few missed opportunities‚Ä¶but it gets credit for laying the groundwork for Kang in such a MAJOR (pun intended) way, and that alone saves it. It's going to fall in my bottom third of MCU rankings, but, that's still in good company. I still consider it important and enjoyable viewing! Don't miss it‚Ä¶or be warned that Kang will find you and BURN YOU OUT OF TIME!! :) RATING: 7/10, B-"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was just about what I expected from an Antman movie. It was funny and Cassie‚Äôs and Scott‚Äôs relationship was so cute. Kang was awesome, but having him in an Antman movie was always going to nerf his powers down to match with Antman. I thought it was a solid start to phase 5 and I do not think this movie was as bad as some critics said it was."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,A little protracted.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie started out pretty slow. Took about an hour for me to really get into it. Once it got going though it was a lot of fun. Not as funny as the first two, but definitely more action packed with higher stakes. 
Wondering if I watched the same movie as everyone else who though it was awful and boring. Definitely better than anything Phase 4 put out(except for Spider-Man NWH)."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I like all marvel comics movies and have seen all the ant man movies now
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a good movie brought the mcu back to it's beginnings I felt after a few bad movies in Thor and eternals... Mr. Majors is excellent. Really enjoyed it! Jonathan has his work cut out for himself over phase 5!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"in general it is a good movie, the only thing that disappointed is modok's cgi"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just got done with the movie and I have to say it was a nice addition to the Antman films as a whole. This movie was in my opinion the strongest of the 3. It was fun while being aware of the messages it was trying to send. The acting was good the humor was there as well. I honestly believe these critics are stuck in the Endgame Era and if every movie doesn't come in as strong as that it's not good enough. My theater had people clapping, cheering and laughing what more do you need for a movie to be good? Is the movie perfect no but is the movie a good time yes. You bring anyone who watched any other antman movie and they'll find something to enjoy."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Funny and full of action!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was not at all what I was expecting. It just didnt come together well for me. It was a decent movie but the plot could have definitely been better.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"By far the worst Marvel Movie to date. Not sure when Ant-Man became a sci-fi Star Wars-esque movie. Half expected Obi-Wan to walk out of a portal. Terrible explanations, no world building, really just classically built like current Marvel movies. I'm really in awe. Marvel releases movies like this and expects their comedy to basically give their movies a passable movie pass. I really don't know what."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Cassie was annoying and cringey but Scott and Kang were hot
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was extremely corny in every single way, but Kang. My goodness. I didn't think superhero fatigue was possible being a comic collector. This is probably Paul Rudd's worst movie.

The reason it gets 2 stars is Jonathan Majors. He is the only bright spot of this movie. He single handedly carried it."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,film was funny and enjoyable. action was also great
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Action-packed and a ton of fun.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It‚Äôs a good Marvel movie‚Ä¶ but not necessarily a good Ant-Man movie. Totally worth seeing Kang, but it does feel a little awkward that Ant-Man is the one dealing with Kang. Overall. Decent. Not great."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"La mire con bajas expectativas y termine saliendo feliz del cine.
Me gust√≥, lo m√°s flojo de la pel√≠cula sin duda es todo lo que se refiere a Modok el resto es muy redondo.
Kang un fuera de serie lo mejor y las post cr√©ditos venden entradas."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I really dislike what they did to Modox, just felt his character was watered down from the source material. That attempt at redeeming him by telling him to be less of a dick... really? ugh, I liked the arc concerning Kane, but this bit could've been left out and have a much better movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Not sure what the critics are looking at but a true marvel fan. I enjoyed this movie. Pleas watch the Loki series to understand Kang. If you don‚Äôt watch it then you will feel the storyline is slow. A def just watch. I had no complaints!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's was really fun !! Jonathan Major was incredible as Kang the conqueror.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Marvel is going downhill.  This movie wasn't terrible but it doesn't have the level of epic'ness that Marvel movies used to always have. I don't blame this movie for being meh, I blame where the MCU is heading."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just when I thought Marvel has been losing it, they redeemed themselves with Antman and Wasp Quantumania. I thought the story was very good, the special effects were right on par, and the characters fit well into the story. Good job Marvel. I will see it again."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. A nice change from the usual fare. Great Gillian and spoiler alert Bill Murray. Who doesn‚Äôt love him. Great fun.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wholly disappointing. Kang wasn't a bad villain but him losing to ants makes it hard to take him seriously. I personally miss the small scale heist style of the previous movies, especially Luis. I wanted an emotional story about Scott as a father and instead we got horrid CGI and a jumbled plot."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was very entertaining overall.  Unfortunately there was some political messages, but more subtle and easier to ignore.  There was a lot more to like than dislike and the Kang character was extremely well done."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved everything about it
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Early CGI was a bit off, but it seemed to have corrected itself later in the movie. Overall great family fun movie. Quirky like Ant-man should be."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I most enjoy the more fantasy heavy comic book movies so this one was a pure delight. I can see that it's not everyone's cup of tea, but for what it is, it's great."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"the movie didn't do it for me. it felt short in every way possible. There was maybe one or two laughs, action was whatever, and I wasn't amazed or wow'd by any character in the story. Anyone who loved Ant Man 1 and 2 will find things to appreciate about this movie but we'll have to work for it.  Its a pass for theaters."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome fun movie
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this movie was really good
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,had a great time with my gf!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Took my grandkids and we all loved it
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie is just average at best.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was incredible, the characters were just as engaging as previously seen, the visuals do occasionally look weird with green screening, but are generally stunning, the plot was a tad generic but was very fun and it was overall a really enjoyable experience"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible. Not worth the time it takes to enter the the title on a search in a streaming service. The movie has lost the fun, charm, that made the first two films so endearing."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie.   This is the best marvel movie since Spiderman with the 3 Spidermen.   Was surprised how good Kang was.    Expected to be disappointed and left the movie wanting to go see it again. Endgame/Spiderman with 3 Spiderman/Quantamania only 3 recent marvelous I will see multiple times in the theatre.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Major's Kang is worthy foe and is leading the MCU in an interesting and exciting direction, but unfortunately the newest Ant-Man   has a lot of questionable decisions, a lousy script, so let's see how Marvel responds."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I went in with low expectations due to the recent Marvel films and TV series, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Definitely one of the better recent ones.  Still has a lot of holes but it was entertaining.  3 stars for the effort and Michelle Pfeiffer still looks great!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"6/10, not what expected"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is filled with fantastic imagery and action an absolute visual feast.
I will need to watch it many times to catch everything. 
I love Kathryn Newton as Cassie!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Over all I enjoyed the movie it was a really really really awesome movie lot of laughs and awesome action
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Screw the critics. This was damn entertaining.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I personally really liked this movie, and while some jokes fell flat most i really liked. The cgi wasn't really as bad is i've seen some reviews make it out to be and i thought the move looked good. Also Johnathon Majora performace as kang was wonderful abd he really stole every sceen he was in.While there is more stuff-both pros and cons- that i don't really have the time to talk about, i really enjoyed the move and had a fun time watching it."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Epic feel. Great villain.  Incredible action sequences.  Just enough humor but not so much that it took away from the seriousness of the threat, peril and heroism."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Negatives: No Michael Pe√±a/Luis (in a freaking Ant Man movie which he's always in), ridiculous scenes and dialogue that seemed to be written by children (I trusted you, you gave your word when he didn't know Kang at all, etc), MODOK and how dumb he was/looked and his character's lines (he did not need to be in the movie), and then playing the pronoun game earlier in the movie way too much and how they kept saying ""him, he"" etc talking about Kang just to build tension which got annoying at a certain point.

Positives: Kang was a cool and powerful villain and Jonathan Majors acted very well and I can't wait to see him in Creed 3, Paul Rudd did well as Scott Lang as always and his humor worked, and the world building and effects/green screen looked really good and it was creative what they did with the quantum realm.

Overall it wasn't a bad movie, the story was good but it had parts that made me cringe pretty hard. I'd much rather rewatch the first one or second one (which are more original and funnier)."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was an amazing movie, two thumbs up, this was the first time my daughter and I went to a movie together and it was such a great experience for us both."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Once again the critics are wrong. Go see this movie it's really good.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed. Great Storyline. Can't wait for sequel!!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very fun movie. I‚Äôd recommend watching it if you‚Äôre a fan of Marvel
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, if you enjoyed the other Ant-Man movies you‚Äôll love this too!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,90%CGI. Seems more like a Star Wars movie but good family fun. Great character development.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,I was not able to go see the movie after all. Personal reasons.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,MODOK was the best character hands down!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Very visually captivating!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I wasnt expecting much from this movie but it was a classic Marcel movie that was really good and I still loved all the comic relief moments despite seeing a billion Marvel movies!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dont know what the heck the movie critics watched but this antman and the quantamania was a great movie.  Like i would rate it 2nd best of the marvel movies.  I am huge iron man fan, i think end game is best then this movie then the first black panther.   This movie had lots of great action, and surprises.  Great story, i def want to see it again but with 4d experience.  Go see it in theater."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was by far the worst movie in the MCU. No logic. Undeveloped subplots. Zero character development. And CGI for CGI‚Äôs sake. Awful.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exceptional! The pacing was perfect with no scenes that lagged. Efficient storytelling building from moment to moment and just enough light-hearted banter to make it fun without spoiling the drama. Jonathon Majors performance was phenomenal, elevating each version of Kang we are introduced to with their own flavoring but still a solid undercurrent of stability in that they are variants. Definitely recommend!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some of these audience reviews are breaking my brain. üòÇ I'd say this is the best Disney Marvel movie (that isn't SpiderMan - since that's Sony) since Endgame. Largely entertaining, but has some questionable plot hole-type issues. The cast does a good job, though, so it's definitely worth a watch. Still not sold on Kang as a villain yet. Too many questions about his character and motivations. Was nice to finally have a MCU tie in to the D+ shows, though. (Post credit scene)."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The set up of Kang the Conqueror, I'm sorry, but the guy they chose doesn't suit the part, only succeeds in vznquishing a previously entertaining series."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,So uninspiring.  I'm wanting to watch Marvel less and less each movie.  Too much Marvel content along with decreased quality = pretty mediocre movies.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Shalow and repetitive. Same old thing. It's a pitty that a movie with so great potential delivered so little.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Could of been better
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Reminded me of a bad SpongeBob episode.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This is ant-man movie that feels lika a star wars meets rick and morty
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Marvel action and humor. Rotten Tomatoes critics should be judging grass growing in the yard.  I would consider their opinions equally useful when choosing a movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing movie and movie theater.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie. Paul Rudd is awesome and funny like always. I like the strange world and the two bad guys were great. Not sure why critics gave it so low of score. I think people are to critical of movies. It was as entertaining and fun to watch.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Cane powers started out strong but ended weak‚Ä¶ ants???
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was much better than I expected it to be. While not perfect, it was the best Antman so far in the series. The humor was there but not over the top, and the action scenes were interesting enough to keep me guessing. The universe of the quantum realm was really well thought out and colorful. 

Lastly Jonathan Majors is incredible and he was the best villain in a comic book movie in a long time."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,espectacular la mejor de las 3 pel√≠culas de antman 10101001010101010
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Was a little slow for the first 45 minutes.  It picked up after that.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics have absolutely no idea what the frick they are talking about. I just saw this movie with my wife and best friend at an AMC in Florida (veterans 24). I would give it an 8/9 out of 10. Funny as hell, plot  was great, Jonathan majors killed it as Kang. Super excited for phase 5. End credit scenes were amazing!!!!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Cool and fun move. Remove some cliche and excess of humor and you get the best non-Spiderman phase 4 movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"To predictable. Stupid ""funny"" lines."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely under-rated for being weird and entertaining! Maybe a smidge too long but neat to watch especially in Digital 3D
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really great. Nice start to Phase 5.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It‚Äôs an action packed movie and will want to watch again.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Poor plot and dialogue. I had high hopes for the sequel given the original movie and actors. I was very disappointed. Save your money. Take a pass
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,DONT listen to this ppl making bad reviews I enjoyed this movie!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was a great new addition to the MCU with a cool introduction to Kang
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"honestly I went into this with with no expectations, simply because of the low critic score, but they got that totally wrong!! this movie was fantastic, don't get me wrong it has some flaws, but the story is good. Hope VanDyne is the MVP!!! Getting to see Kang sent shivers down my spine, setting up for things to come and I can't wait!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,20/20 would recommend
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang by far elevates this movie but outside of that the movie is a mess. No spoilers but they bring back a villain and he looks cartoonishly bad. Still the movie offers excitement for the direction the MCU is going with Kang as the main villain.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a lot of fun. For fans who feel some of these movies post-Endgame are one and the same, this is sure to surprise you. Embrace the weirdness, suspend a little disbelief, and you'll have a great time. 

Paul Rudd is a national treasure, and should be protected at all costs. Jonathon Majors as Kang is no joke. Some CGI characters stand out, but nothing's perfect. Overall a great ride and a fun way to turn your brain off for a few hours. Visually stunning at times. If you're a fan, you'll have a good time. Embrace the weird! This is a superhero who can shrink and talk to ants, after all."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Started a little slow for me and the script wasn‚Äôt the best but I still really enjoyed it.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, sets up the franchise!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent Marvel movie as usual.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was All over the place
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A bit slow, but I thought the third act was very satisfying. Honestly, I think critics are taking this all too seriously. Something can just be fun, and that's what this is. Jonathan Majors is a phenomenal actor and this is no exception."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film, lots of funny moments, great story"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Should have spent more money on the storyline. Special effects were great, but the story was lacking continuity of the previous Antmen and Avengers movies."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was good from start to finish.. lots of action.  Johnathon Majors is blowing up
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"movie was ok, funny moments, some jokes didn't land and bordered on cringe."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Johnathan Majors' Kang carried the movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun movie with great visuals and action sequences. Jonathan Majors absolutely killed it...can't wait to see more of him as Kang. Some of the comedy was cheesy and MODOK was funny, but entirely unnecessary for the story in my opinion."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film was proper comic book campy fun, the Sort of humour you come to expect from an Antman movie without it feeling forced and detrimental to the overaching story like recent marvel entries have been.

A good introduction to a very well portrayed new villain while making sure to keep the Antman family fresh and enjoyable.

CGI is a bit dodgy in places but is forgiven as the general look of the movie sticks very closely to its comic book routes with both colour and design.
Not the strongest story in the MCU but definitely one of their most easy going watches."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst movie ive ever seen
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved it screw the haters, of the 3 most recent marvel movies Dr Strange, Thor, and antman this is the best! Was entertaining and sets up the future of the mcu!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was an amazing movie I highly recommend coming to see it!!!!!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don‚Äôt understand all the hate this movie is receiving. It is an enjoyable ride with great visuals and a decent story. Is it one of the MCU‚Äôs best? No. Is it its worst? Not by a long shot (I‚Äôm looking at you, Thor: Love and Thunder). Quantumania introduces an excellent villain and sets things up well for future installments. My only complaint about the whole multiverse saga is that it undermines the stakes. ‚ÄúOh, Dr. Strange died? It‚Äôs okay. There are plenty more variants out there.‚Äù I hope the MCU can regain the gravitas it managed to build for Infinity War and Endgame. "
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Might be my favorite of the Ant-Man Trilogy hope to see more from this cast in the future love the series... And Kang 'Nuff said!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a fun and exciting addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, featuring a great mix of action, humor, and heart, with top-notch performances from the cast, fascinating exploration of the quantum realm, and a plot full of twists and turns. It's a must-see for Marvel fans and anyone looking for a fun movie experience."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I took my 2 teenage sons to see this this weekend and we all loved it. It's a fun comic book movie.  Having most of the movie take place in an alternate dimension was A nice change of pace. The previous 2 movies took place in San Francisco.  It sets itself apart from the previous 2.

"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Three Words ‚ÄúI Am KANG!‚Äù Absolutely awesome
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than critics reviews - needed as part of MCU, not an all time epic but enjoyable"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic.  Not sure what the critics saw, or why we still have critics, but I loved it"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was like Star Wars meets the Avengers but with oddly placed humor that felt a little forced or cheesy. Some of my family felt the good guys had it too easy, that Kang should have been harder to defeat. But we all love Paul Rudd and Marvel so this was overall a win for us."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I feel like being a ""critic"" means you can't enjoy movies any more, since you have to pick everything apart and want your qord to mean something... You miss out on the purpose of movies, entertainment, escapism, happiness. This movie was a lot of fun! If you let it be."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good, not great movie.  Glad Kang is finally in the MCU.  Looking forward to see what they do with his character."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"9/10, lots of plot armor and a few of the jokes didn't land, but a beautiful and fun movie with a great villain."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was extremely enjoyable. I love how they introduced this new villain. Johnathan Majors was the perfect actor to pull off the multiple Kang characters.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Don't exactly know what the big deal was with the critics. The movie is supposed to be wacky, hence the ""mania"" part of the title. Certainly not the best Marvel offering in recent times, but it moves the mcu nicely along. Recommended"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie as it kept me on the edge of my seat.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it was a distinct departure from the first two movies, but still worked"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, me and the family enjoyed it. Can't wait to see more from this phase!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was FANTASTIC!! It‚Äôs not your classic Antman funny story Kang brings a weight to the story that made it really powerful. I loved it.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good start to Phase 5. Pretty slow first half and wish we got more Kang action , but definitely a must watch. "
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,When I walked into the theater to watch this movie I didn't know what to expect. I was hoping the highs would outweigh the lows and to be honest it did. Jonathan Majors is doing an incredible job as Kang and Katherine Newton plays Cassie beautifully. If this is what Phase 5 is going to look like for Marvel then I'm exited for what's to come.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Um bom filme para o homem Formiga. Um √≥timo filme para abrir a fase 5. Falaria que o MODOK precisaria de mtas melhorias. Mas meio que n√£o tem necessidade. ASSISTAM
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is both fun and exciting. The pace is good with great action throughout. More importantly, this movie is heavily focused on Kang and is a great window into what type of villain we should expect going forward. Majors is awesome as Kang."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring 
Kids movie 
The whole movie was a war with no beginning or ending"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I Loved it. Reviews say it‚Äôs the worst Antman but I disagree! Please give a chance and stay till the VERY END! üòâ
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie,  seeing it in 3d was awesome,  beautiful landscapes,  a lot of new characters,  story was fresh."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I wasn't a big fan at first but the latter half really stepped it up
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun movie that lacked the charm of the previous Ant-Man/Wasp, but Kang and MODOK steal the show, and it successfully lays the groundwork for the next phase of MCU movies."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel is officially done... each movie that has to change everything becomes absolutely dumb. Please don't waste your money, don't invest in such movies unless you want to treat yourself this way. 

Always keep in mind that it used to be like Iron Man and The Infinite War, now it's like Antman and Doctor Strange, Thor, Venom, Morbius, and so on. I hope they won't spoil whatever they have left such as Black Panther, Guardians of The Galaxy, Spider-Man and etc."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally, Marvel returns to making great movies! One of the best Marvel film in years!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow. Marvel has lost their way. I thought it was boring (I actually drifted off for a minute). The dialogue seemed forced, the CGI was too much and the story was not very imaginative. It's only saving grace is Kang.  I would not recommend it."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics about this movie.  It is fun. The highlight of the film is Majors. The actor is amazing! I can't wait to see more of him. 
4/5 because of MODOK... I didn't like what they did with the character. MODOK should have had his own movie..."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Much better than I expected. Certainly better than Love & Thunder. Not perfect, but entertaining."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A m√≠ me pareci√≥ que la pel√≠cula est√° bien en aspecto general, Kang el personaje como tal es muy bueno y con el consejo de Kang se prepara todo para Avengers 5, me esperaba algo tr√°gico que muriera o que pareciera que muriera alguno pero no todo fue un ""final feliz"", el CGI de MODOK mal√≠simo eso se pudo haber mejorado, y tampoco le vi sentido que se ""volviera bueno"" en esos 2 segundos, pero en l√≠nea general, la pel√≠cula est√° bien, disfrutable..."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,very good movie! it was packed with action and humor.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,No explanation needed. Just a bad movie
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thrilling, heartwarming, and epic. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone seeking a great time and watch. Ant Man was a solid win, ‚Äúfor the little guy.‚Äù"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,My husband and children went and they absolutely loved the entire theatre. I can‚Äôt wait til I can get in there üôÇüôÇ
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie experience fun and funny and thrilling I wish it was longer
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it was good, but just wasn‚Äôt that satisfying."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super super super!  Not sure why critics tend to rate bad, but this movie was great! The acting, the scenes, everything was superb!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good start off to the next phase of MCU.  Paul Rudd delivers as always and is entertaining as Scott Lang.  The VFX team knocked it out of the park to come up with a look for a new  / different universe, it looked like something we've never seen before.  Entertaining, funny, exciting and impactful.  A must see."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally this movie found the true market niche here in Colorado, Spanish-speaking and bilingual people are am excellent audience for movies in general. Nos gusto mucho la pel√≠cula en especial corte interdimensional, fuera de lo comun , con muchos mensajes de empoderamiento para los ni√±os, la familias y las minorias, solo hay que estar bien enfocados para entender bien la trama e hilo de la historia! La recomiendo mi gente! "
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, engaging, good pace, loved seeing the visuals - I thought cgi was really good. The only thing a little weird and felt forced was MODOK. Great escape for 2 hours!!!! Well done. People complaining about plot and story and blah blah blah‚Ä¶ it's science fiction!!!! Come on man!!!!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a pretty good movie, one of Marvel‚Äôs best in this phase. Good plot, a little cheesy at times but great visual effects as usual. It was a great into to Kang."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,A narrative mess that relies too heavily on CGI spectacles and set-ups for the MCUs future. Johnathan Majors as Kang is the best and worst thing about this movie in that his performance as the villain is on point but his relevance to the story feels forced.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"While it was different from the first two Ant-Man adventures, it's still an incredibly fun movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Solid watch, about to see it a second time. Kang was solid, the post credits link to multiple things and more than one series which I love. A few things felt meh. Its rotten score is absolutely ridiculous. I do agree the movie does feel like a payoff for future events but still retains qualities that make it fit in the ant man trilogy."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie overall and would recommend a watch
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wouldnt paid to see the movie! Thank you IHOP for the free tickets.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantum realm pretty trippy.    Modok is funny and kang the conqueror pretty cool bad guy
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was better than expected.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,As Scott says  There is always room to grow
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish. Most expansive world of all with magnificent characters and visuals throughout. Plot sets up Kang‚Äôs unleashing power perfectly. 
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Needed more ants. Ok
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Its move very good about Kang introduce,fight climAx are good ,story telling and Qutam theory its not good. All carecter acting its wonderful ... 
3.5/5 rateing.... Love you kang"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie!! Only thing I didn‚Äôt like was some man in the movies was sleep snoring!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was fun, Jonathan Majors steals every scene, even Michelle Pfieffer and Michael Douglas had some fun moments. Was it the best Marvel movie? Nah but it's still worth the watch imo."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really loved the movie, I must admit that If surprised me and I would like a fourth movie with these wonderful cast!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Stinky bad movie, this is supposed to be the basis for the new phase of marvel? god help us."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A Quantum realm could have been such an imaginative way to express what we know about physics at that scale (atoms, neutrons, electrons, quarks, etc.), and instead it was just vaguely weird 3D that could have been another planet, or another dimension, or whatever I don't want a textbook, just five seconds of research, ya know? Left before the end."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's not perfect but not bad. There's some cheesyness but still works. Some of thr pacing and lines are a little choppy but was easy to overlook. Kang was awesome and solid post scenes.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Funnier than expected! Totally would recommend to literally anyone. Acting was superb and the VFX were amazing as well!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great graphics but the story was a bit lackluster.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than what people are saying
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie helps set up the future marvel movies
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily more entertaining than Ant Man & The Wasp, Thor: Love & Thunder and Wakanda Forever"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantamania is well worth the price of admission and perfectly leans into the humor and weirdness of the previous Ant-Man installments. Jonathan Majors is captivating as Kang, Rudd and the growing cast of characters hits on the right notes. The film has plenty of surprise laughs and twists to more than make up for the world-building of the Quantum realm that could have otherwise been a drag."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics again don't know their own arse from a hole in the ground.  There is no way this movie deserves to be in the same rotten range as Eternals and Love and Thunder.  I enjoyed the movie as a jumping in for the next phase of the MCU and the next Thanos level threat.  Maybe one good gripe is that we needed to up the stakes with an emotional loss....but it would be hard to kill off Lang with what's 
coming...wasp or Hank maybe?"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Lots of action, but could not totally follow storyline, the Villain was New but unknown to give true credibility. Needed more Villain scenes to help understand earlier just how dangerous he could be. Good entertainment for the kids."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Typical Marvel movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is a tonal mess. You have an incredible intriguing and menacing villain in Kang, interesting sci fi concepts and a strong premise. But the writers took every chance they had to make fun of the movie they were making so the audience will naturally reject the concepts the movie presents. Still some great action scenes and sets up the future very well. 6/10"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good story line, it ties in very well with what's coming."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think if someone is a MCU fan, they will enjoy it. It was funny I thought. Some parts were really over the top and silly BUT....... It was a pretty good time. Not great and if you searching for everything wrong, you will find it. I'd put it this way, its not run out and see immediately. However, when you ready to get out the house and see an entertaining movie check it out"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Sets up the next big bad villain perfectly.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite the negative reviews/tweets/comments about the movie I actually thought it was enjoyable , kang was pretty awesome ,in the Loki show (it was okay) I did not like that version of kang ,but this one was pretty cool. The CGI honestly is to be expected .To compare it with recent installments ,it‚Äôs definitely better than Thor 4, which when I first saw it ,I liked it ,but after it came on streaming platforms and watched it again I did not like it ,but honestly the feeling coming out this movie was a little different,my point is to not listen to the negative reviews and go and see this with an open mind ,not that bad."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great. The casual viewer might not understand everything in this movie but it's a good watch nonetheless. I'm excited to see what happens next.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Personally I thought it was an amazing movie, CGI in my opinion was amazing. The story told what needed to be told I believe for the continuation of the mcu storyline. Overall great movie"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies I have seen. So ridiculous.  Barely want to give it a one star.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't understand the hate for this one it was very enjoyable.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"alot of fun to watch, and alot of good foreshadowing for the future of the multiverse saga with Kang,  and for the next installment of loki! but the fight scenes weren't all that good and I wish it wasn't all in the quantum realm, and I missed Mike pena and T.I.! fun overall though and will see again bc I love anything MCU!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really dont get why so many negatives to this movie, is not perfect, it is not the best Marvel movie but i really enjoy it , it was a lot of fun , really loved all the quantum realm world building"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie still had that Ant-Man laugh that you expect with the title while still having serious moments. Yes, there were bits and pieces that don't match up on the surface. But if you stop to think about it, the stuff does fit and make sense. It was a good movie and I can't wait to see where it goes from here. AND REMEMBER. THIS IS A MARVEL MOVIE, DONT KEAVE TIL THE SCREEN GOES BLACK!!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"ANT-MAN & THE WASP: QUANTIMANIA was moreso a prologue to the character Kang
the Conquer than a true, third ANT-MAN film that was completely stripped of its identity. Gone is the lightness of the series heart and humor exchanged for a CGI-ridden Luc Besson-style Sci-fi silliness of the mid-90s, anchored by
extraordinary supporting performances from Jonathan Majors, an incomparable Bill Murray, and scene stealer Corey Stoll who's character shouldn't have worked, but did, in a way only Marvel can achieve on screen."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too much CGI
Kang was a no show
Not sure what the fear was with Kang the ?"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Marvel has a villain problem and it‚Äôs becoming increasingly obvious with every new movie. The threat never feels like a threat. I wanted to love the movie and the trailers make it feel like there‚Äôs weight and impact to what I expected to transpire and in reality it never quite lived up to the gravity of the situation they tried to capture. I‚Äôll keep showing up to any Marvel movie and will watch this at least once more but I‚Äôd say this is good not great. Definitely not as bad as the critic scores but nothing memorable long term.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as the first two.  Abandons their self-contained stories to just be an overlong commercial for future MCU projects.  Still not as bad as others are making it out to be and better than most other Marvel movies.  The 3D is good, and the acting was excellent.  Hope's pixie haircut was as well.  That said, I think this is the end for me with Marvel. They have nothing scheduled for the next 5 years I'm interested in.  Fun while it lasted I guess.  Hopefully they get rid of Feige and Moore."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie and a return for Marvel. Ant-man schtick with a zany Quantum Realm, it's a setup movie for what's to come."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun and enjoyable movie. Great villain, great story, great family dynamics. However, there were some missed opportunities and the tone sometimes doesn't find where it should be."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good story line and loaded with action, perfect for a 12 year old boy."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've been waiting for this movie to kick off the next phase. It was not a let down! Whatever expectations others had, I didn't have them. I'm a comic fan and have been since child hood. I watched all the content leading up to this release. And despite the critics, I was entertained and will see it again tomorrow. I'd recommend this film as it leads into the next phase and introduces a new villain who's sure to not disappoint!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel appear to have lost their way. Too much CGI, poor characters, wrong tone, poorly directed. A long long way from the first two movies. Poor world setting, no connection with characters. Terrible movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a middling attempt at re-engaging the audience after the disastrous Phase 4 (bore).   I think the worst criticism I can give a movie is that it bored me for about 40%.  The CGI is dark, and overwhelming.  It has the formulaic approach to marvel story telling without any significant twists.  You know what is going to happen as soon as all the characters are established. There is little character development.  There are some potentially interesting communities in the quantum realm but we learn nothing about them.   Kang is a middling villain.  We dont yet understand his goals.  The multiverse continues to make death and consequence seem irrelevant.  Phase 5 seems to be just a continuation of the mess evolved in Phase 4.  I had hoped for alot more."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was better than I expected.  Felt like Tron meets MCU.  I was worried too much CGI would make it weird but it was good.  One character was a bit‚Ä¶ odd.  You‚Äôll figure it out when you watch it.  Otherwise, it was very good.  Witty and fun."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The comedy and banter were good. Special effects were pretty great. I didnt like how much it looked like Star Wars though. And I feel if the main new villain is going to be bigger than Thanos then it might have been better to go a different route. But overall good.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"slow build up, but eventually gets interesting."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dull, slow, CGI is ok and instead of ant-man it's a origin movie for kang movie. Kang and scott character were well acted.
Spoiler alert:- the character Darren in first movie was made as lame as Thor in love and thunder which was unacceptable. Overall, this movie was a promotional video for phase 5."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Wowww!!! Epic just epic! I was thoroughly surprised at how great this movie was. Do not listen to the poor reviewers‚Ä¶.this movie had everything that makes a great movie great! Going to definitely see it again! KANG is definitely A BIG PROBLEM‚Ä¶ moving forward. My faith in Marvel and their Phase 5  vision‚Ä¶ IS FULLY RESTORED!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was good fun and definitely sets up the villain as unstoppable. 

Go see it now."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun dialog and full of action. Starts slow but has great ending.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel has become predictably tiresome
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man Review: Underused Kang.

 I found the movie enjoyable and the visuals were consistent and fantastic. It was a very creative movie and the CGI floating head is peak comedy but still done well. The only thing negative thing I have about this film was the way they handled Kang the conqueror, Jonathan Majors is an incredible actor and I think they underused him and overall felt like he could have done more. They had a good build up for Kang. They said that he has destroyed multiple universes and has killed so many avengers to the point where he forgets how many he has killed but in the end he got defeated by the ant family and lost very badly. Not even able to kill one person. Overall it was a fine movie I would give it a 7.4/10

In summary, while Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania had some positive aspects, the underuse of Kang the Conqueror was a letdown for me."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Dont know why people are hating this movie. It is still very enjoyable! The story has a heart (Paul Rudd) and a very awesome villain whom Jonathan Major did so well in portraying. Ok there's the problem with the backstory/development of the people in the Quantum Realm ‚Ä¶ but I dont think it justifies the ratings to be docked as much.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie. Theatre I watched in in however sucked.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel needed to stop after endgame. All they're doing now is ruining the original Canon that we all loved. Big disappointment.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie loved every second
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I swear. . . You critics are a$$hats. . . Lacks the fun?? You do realize this was technically a David vs the Goliath times ten type of story? Stakes were much higher in this movie. Storyline was just what they needed to kick off phase 5. They complained about CGI. . .have you not seen any superhero movie lately? Like End Game. . . Everything has been mostly green screen. These critics are Lame as hell. The audience is loving so go shove your dumb typewriters up that hole that üí© comes out of. You expect it to be as funny as the other ones but the comedy in this movie was pretty good. Only kept to parts they needed it to be. Go do some research on Kang and then come back and tell me this movie wasn't good. . . There was so much here that was happening. They even complained about the quantum realm. . . Bruh. . . It's called quantumania!!! Kang is stuck in the quantum realm. . . So where else will it take place at?? To the audience. . . Just go watch it. Rotten tomatoes has been filled dummy that should have been dusted when Thanos did his snap.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie entertaining  with excellent graphics and plenty of action.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid addition to the MCU.  Unlike the prior two Ant-Man movies, Quantumania isn't mostly a comedy to refresh the palate in comparison to the heavier work by the other Avengers.  Kang is a bona fide villain and Scott Lang is starting to take his work a bit more seriously/stop viewing himself as just a side kick to the ""real"" Avengers. 
The cast is terrific: the Lang/Pym family is still fun to watch, Kathryn Newton does a terrific job as the new Cassie, and Jonathan Majors is wonderful as Kang.  Oh, and there's a Bill Murray cameo, too!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure I understand this critic score?? I'm pretty picky about the movies I enjoy, but I don't think that this movie deserves a critic score this low. It makes sense, the visuals are fine given the fact the entire story is set in a unknown world...the humor was good...the characters were all good...just say you don't like Marvel anymore and go lol."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just when I thought Marvel was running out of juice, they give us a reminder as to why we love them. WAY BETTER than the last movie but the first still has the most charm."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was okay. Could‚Äôve used more action sequences and more Kang.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Way better than everything in phase 4. Step in the right direction
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Liked the storyline. Liked that it was lighthearted and fun - not a movie to be taken too seriously. Some pretty bada$$ women as heroes! Dislikes were that is is sometimes silly and the ending was a bit confusing. Darren was flat out weird. This movie won‚Äôt win any awards but sometimes you need the silliness to offset the crazy world we live in sometimes.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Not as funny as the first two movies. The action great. The special effects were top notch and the quantum realm was just amazing.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and a great villain for the phase 5 a must watch for all marvel fans and this movie is another great start to the phase 5
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent story telling to set up the new faze of the MCU. Gonna go see it again since there is a lot going on.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Thank god it not by DC people because this was great
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors knocks it out of the park. At times quiet and gentle, at others bristling with menance. The humor hit at the right spots. The family dynamics were enjoyable. I thought the story could have been fleshed out a bit more and they jumped right into it but it still told a decent story, explained what the mom did down there for 30 years, and addressed some key information with Kang. The visual were fantastic and definitely took us on a trip down to the Quantum Realm. I'd watch it again."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Since Disney took over, Marvel offerings have lost their magic. Ironic really."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,M-She-U is at it again.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not perfect, but a good visual showing. I like the interactions between Scott and family, but the Kang story seems kinda meh."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best ant man movie to date, brings the story full circle and whole family of heroes in it. Next Marvel movie continues from this story and plot."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action, hilarious fast paced dialogue and a great inrtoduction to a villan. i did miss the rest of Ant-Man's posse, however."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, exciting and full of action
A visual treat that gives a well-deserved treatment to all the characters in the Antman saga."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,actuon packed and still a few funny moments worth watching..
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Went with my husband and 17 year old son and we all thought it was a great movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A lot of fun for both Marvel Comic Book fans and MCU diehards. Not as much comedy as the previous Ant-Man movies. Kang was near perfect, MODOK was interesting, not sure how I feel about that yet but the tone was spot-on for a character who was meant to be treated as a joke in the Marvel Universe, Comic or MCU. Loved that Janet and Hank Pym had larger roles."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,So good. Kang is a legit villain and to see Scott fight him was awesome. A lot of built up emotions!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie a lot. Definitely a must see. I do not agree with the critics are saying about this movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Positives: Kang is great. Movie pacing is decent. Some good visuals. Story although predictable is good.

Negative: too many moments were jokes were forced. Poor overall execution on story at times."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite the ""critics"", this is a Great movie! There's a perfect balance of comedy, tragedy, action, and emotion. No one part is over powering. Marvel did excellent with this one."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is overhated, it's a great movie with great cgi great action scenes and great comedy at the right times. If you love Thor ragnorock, you will love this."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent lead into the next chapter
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Felt more like Starwars than Avengers!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked this movie, it was well written, witty, full of action and sets up the future timeline nicely.  Well worth the 2 hours, I'll probably watch again."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Must see! Best Antman Yet!!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not what I expected. I was expecting a big set up for kang dynasty but it was very anticlimactic. Story was bad and not as funny as the 1st one.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very fun movie. Enjoyed the themes, the small guy vs the big power. Not a complicated theme but it executes it well. The whole movie felt like a
 mix between Star Wars, a 80s dark fantasy and Tron. Critics seem to not have liked it, but i also feel like anybody who makes more than a certain bracket of money would have issues with this movie. Most marvel watchers will enjoy this."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"As this Antman is different from the previous two, it helps set up the new phase of the Marvel universe.  Good plot elements to build on for the future."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Just saw it and loved it! Packed IMAX theatre and crowd was laughing and gave it a round of applause at the end. Love the flow and the 3rd act was the best part! Go see this movie and get ready for Kang!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie. Accidentally bought tickets for 3D but still liked it!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"What phase IV was lacking this movie delivered! I wasn't too excited before this movie for where Marvel was going, but now I can't wait for the build up to the next movies and the finale with Kang. They've done Kang so well, so much so that I'm more worried about him than I was with Thanos."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,good start to the phase for Marvel even if it could have been better
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched this movie on the day it got released here in the UK and I thought that it was great! I liked the acting done by each actor, especially Jonathan Majors.

It's hard to not notice that there was a lot of cgi but I guess it's nothing to be surprised by when all of this is set in the MCU's 'Quantum Realm'. I think that this cgi was somewhat distracting but not completely to the point that I would be fully focused on that, but I guess this is needed so it fits the location and environment of where the characters are.

This movie is a big step-up from the last two Ant-Man movies. The first two movies were about something that was not all that major, then the third movie moved on to something that could have definitely been world-altering. I think the step-up for this movie was a great choice as it enables Marvel to let such a powerful character play it's role within the MCU.

Overall, I think this movie wonderful and a great start to Phase 5. It gets me excited for the upcoming projects that are scheduled for release in the future."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was so much fun. It felt like Ant-Man meets Guardians/Thor Ragnarok so no complaints. Paul Rudd is as amazing as ever. üíô
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,excellent visual effects were excellent must see in 3d
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,For what the movie is talking about. It was well done. To bring a world like that to the big screen. Some things didn't make sense. But no movie is perfect. The movie brought enough humor and story to pull through. And to set up phase 5 of the mcu.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining, I enjoyed it!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the movie. Was easy to follow.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as great as previous MCU entries and felt like it was mostly put together to introduce Kang, but still fun."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is getting a lot of unfair hate. The movie is really good, very sci-fi and plenty of action. Jonathan Majors is fantastic as Kang, and the movie builds up the over arching MCU multiverse story. Do not listen to the critics on this one, they are definitely and evidently in a different universe than us the mundane people. If you liked endgame, you will like this film. It's a really great time at the movies, check it out."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,All I can say is this movie was awesome and let the Kang Dynasty begins!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I think the critics may be out of touch.  This was fun.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Reallly enjoyed this movie, much more than I thought I would. A lot of action and good story. Great characters and development, though I did miss the typical Michael Pe√±a summary from prior Ant-Man films.
Don't listen to the critics remember they told ud that Ad Astra was good. Look at audience scores instead."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie that is definitely worth seeing theatrically for the spectacle of the Quantum Realm.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I fell in love with the movie as a whole, even with some flaws it has. I got caught up in the storyline from start to finish. The script bothered me a little, it has some negative points yes, but nothing that spoiled my experience. I loved watching it, and I'll definitely watch it many more times."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The CGI was great in spite of what people are saying. Every cast member (old and new) did an outstanding job.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Too long. Predictable storyline and too much movement.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was awesome. To me it did what the movie was suppose to do which was set up phase 5!!Now we can wait to see how
All this plays out."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant man 3, doesn't reach the heights of the Avengers Endgame, but it doesn't have to. The family story drama in the quantum realm, really highlights the good chemistry between the actors, and shows off how well the previous Ant Man movies feel so connected. Marvel really knows their strengths and Ant Man 3 has it all, the Villain, Kang, is easily the best part of the movie, Majors steals every scene he's in. Overall I think this is a great movie and would recommend to any Marvel fan."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! One of the best yet!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is not  the MCU best film by far but it is a fun and enjoyable time.  Some good jokes but not overboard like Thor 4. Kang was awesome and I think Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfieffer really shine in this film. The other characters are good but this a Kang and old school Wasp movie. Post credit scenes are great and has me excited. I don't know why the critics gave this a bad review. This is a lot better than Iron Man 2, Thor 2, and Thor 4‚Ä¶  IMO of course. I'd say give it a chance. I had a fun time watching this."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite the critic reviews, I really enjoyed the plot and the visuals of Ant Man and Wasp Quantumania. The science and pieces of that within the story make it stand out from the typical super hero story. I also appreciated the theme of helping others no matter how small. I will enjoy showing this film to my young boys when they're old enough to view it. One of the best MCU films I've seen in a while. Also highly reccomend going to see it in 3D if possible."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,could have done without some of the language. and as usual the fight scenes were just too long. but overall it was a fun movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This film was amazing all the acting was top I loved every minute of it this is what marvel should be can not wait to see Kang again
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very disappointed. Too many gimmicks not enough story
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had a blast! some slow explanation scenes but it needed it to make sense. kang was a great new villain and a serious Scott lang is a plus. I really like Cassie lang and I can't wait to see more of her. don't listen to rotten tomatoes critics, they forgot what fun is. Watch it for yourself."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great .
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Always love Paul Rudd but the story line was lame. Special effects were great but the characters were like poor Star Wars imitations.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"For newbie to the MCU or Marvel, the movie is fun, action packed, funny. You can come into it without knowing a lot of the backstories because the exposition covers that and just some cool visuals. For die hard MCUer and especially for those of us who also read the comics, you'll love this. There several surprises that will make you say ""YES"" like you're Thor finding out he's fighting Hulk in the arena. It continues the exploration of the Quantum realm, throws a couple of curve balls that you'll like that introduce new (but old as far as the comics are concerned) and the end credit scene will have you high fiving your friends when you see who and  what they reveal about the future of the MCU (see what I did there). It's a really good movie and I'm going back."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I wished I could‚Äôve seen more connections with ShangChi and Ms. Marvel
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me gust√≥ bastante, no entiendo muy bien por qu√© hay tanta gente que no le gusto, bastante divertida, Kang incre√≠ble como villano, recomendado"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great balance of family, action, stress, and enjoyable scenes. I loved seeing Kang as a real villain and I'm excited to see how this leads into the rest of phase 5."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I like marvels direction on this!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,it was entertaining.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too much quantum and multiverse‚Ä¶
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania at a preview on February 15 followed by a talk with real quantum scientists.  I thought the movie was excellent, and the scientists and the rest of the audience enjoyed it, too.  The cast is great and performs very well.   The movie looks beautiful, too.  The plot is good and I noticed no plot flaws.  The movie doesn't explain everything, but why should it.  The movie is good in and of itself, but it also sets up future movies very well.  I feel that most of the bad reviews do not sound like the critics saw the same movie I saw, and they seem more to be about Marvel fatigue than the movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed and good storyline
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I did not like all the fighting, but still enjoyed watching Paul Rudd, Fred Murry, Michael Douglass and the rest of the cast. I was also amazed at the scenery and kept wondering  How did they do that?.  I may have had to close my eyes during some of the fighting, but I still enjoyed watching the actors and the fun they were having at times. I loved watching Paul Rudd most of the time."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Creative and visually stunning characters and landscapes. Kane had a creepy psychotic tone to him but the last credit scene leaves you guessing what motivated him.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great start to the Multiverse Saga. Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd bring an exciting vibe to the future of the MCU, and help introduce us to the wild intricacies of the Quantum Realm. 

Overall, this was a great film filled with witty jokes and seriously awesome fights. Phase 5 is off to a running start."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie. The critics were wrong. This is one of the best marvel movies out there.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Dialogue was not very good
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, I totally get the Starwars comparisons, jonothan majors was over hyped imo, he was okay. Overall it was a cool movie, plot was fairly simple, a lot of the comic relief came off cheesy."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was good and menacing
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just one more movie about a soulless hero with jokes and a dumb plot
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.

SPOILER WARNING

Overall the movie was good. Most of the movie leading up to the climax was good. Goofy, serious when it needed to be, peak MCU. The only complaint with that is M.O.D.O.K. , his design was stupid and his character was stupid too. Darren Cross was much better than M.O.D.O.K. . The main battle was okay. I'd say too much humor and I found it ridiculous Kang wasn't beating the absolute crap out of everybody. The ending was absolutely stupid for me. First of all, 2 humans in a shrinking and growing suit can beat a man from  the 30+ century? I found that scene very annoying as Kang the Conqueror should have beat them easily. Then he died? Come on Marvel... Then they escape the Quantum realm? Stupid. This broke the streak of losing something in the third movie, which this should have been the movie in which the character lost the most as Kang is easily the strongest Marvel villain ever."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wasn't as funny or charming as the other Ant Man movies. Fake ass Star Wars. Modok was disturbing to say the least! Kang was great and saved the movie from being a total bore.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice intro movie to the next Phase of Marvel movies.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"fun movie, nothing crazy. worth the watch."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of funny moments, mostly compelling, leaving one star for wanting more Kang/his backstory and for the wasp's haircut"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie! Kang is a godlike character and a powerhouse. Antman‚Ä¶controls ant and gets small and big. I had no idea how this would turn out! Fun film.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was an improvement over the first Ant-Man and the Wasp, although I did miss seeing some characters from the first 2 movies that did not appear in this one. The Quantum World was very well imagined, maybe a bit too CGI-heavy but overall an engaging visual experience. The characters played well off each other and there were some very funny moments sprinkled in. I saw the movie with my 15-year-old daughter and we both had fun watching: it was a good popcorn flick for sure."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Filme com di√°logos bem fracos e com v√°rios furos no roteiro.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie! Definitely a must see!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I Loved it,I haven't been this satisfied with the MCU in quite a long time.It is Darker than the other 2 ,but Jonathan Majors KILLS IT as Kang.I wasn't thrilled with how they introduced Kang in Loki to be Honest but his portrayal of Kang  in Aatw:Quantumania is a Great Villain in the years to come.."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel Studios' ""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" features outstanding performances and effectively introduces the MCU's new big bad, but it abandons the franchise's signature essence, opting for a more emotionally high-staked, but derivative and distracted, story."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The film is different from the advances we have had with a slow and uninteresting start, Kang is the best of the film, although with an ending written by an AI, some scenes were poor to see because of how poorly done they were, but I admit that the rest looked pretty good in terms of CGI and the quantum world."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Cute and rewarding family story in the MCU, Kang obviously a fantastic character and all parts played well by every actor. Let down by some mildly poor/ muddy CGI backgrounds at times looking a bit like spy kids. Movie would have been better without the push for a new big bad, even if he was played well. Just a lot going on. Partner got bored from exposition. Movie shines in its smaller character moments."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had fun.  My wife had fun. My son had fun.  Would watch again.

The critics have a stick up their butt.  They need to learn to have fun."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you're a Marvel fan, you're going to love the movie. The critics get paid to write long reviews about lack of character development, yada yada. The movie moves along quickly, looks gorgeous, has enough laughs to stay true to Ant-Man style without being overdone, and is a great kickoff to the next phase."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A total BLAST! Loved every second of it, Quantum astonished!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,If your a Marvel fan you will like it. (Not on a love level) Don't look for an Avenger type action. Follow the story. I think this is the beginning of something big coming in the future. And stay after. 2 spoiler trailers after both credits.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,The render time on this one had to be up there. The intro and the outro were funny bookends I guess.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This anticipated movie had all the Marvel juice u was waiting for. It was exciting to see hints Marvel had dropped in previous shows/ movies such as Loki & Moon Knight (to name a few) come to fruition. Paul Rudd gave us what we have come to love and expect from Scott Lang aka Ant Man while presenting his characters evolution. Lang is such a crucial character for the audience as he is the most like us and you can be on board with his triumphs and anxieties. Cassie is intriguing and after watching this movie I'm keen to see how she evolves and becomes our human representative in the movies. My favourite character by far was Johnathon Majors, Kang. I was truly terrified by him yet couldn't get enough. The movie as a whole was entertaining and fun to watch."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Paul Rudd makes the movie, great to watch! Down side...typical Marvel movie, destroy EVERYTHING trying to defeat the bad guy...not sure if the bad guy can do much worse"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it. It was fun and had heart. Didn't seem like 2 hours (I was not looking at my watch for this movie). Remember/ this is a comic book movie so don't expect a ""Terms of Endearment"" type gravitas. Acting was good, particularly Kang and Janet. Bill Murray cameo was fun. Watched this in 3D and it was excellent viewing - well employed. Rudd owns his character- very comfortable with it. I will be watching it again in two days (taking my wife)!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,O filme √© incr√≠vel quem discordar √© um pau no cu
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A little slow, but overall good movie"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best marvel movies since spiderman no way home, really enjoyed it cgi looks great as well and kang is awesome, don't get why the hate in the reviews but the movie is fun and entertaining"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally, an enjoyable and not disappointing Marvel movie in the past few years.  Funny, action packed, thoughtful, entertaining.  Foreboding, mysterious, evil, honorable, good, the works. Some things didn't make sense, but there's a lot in this movie to unpack.  Most of it very good.  This movie finally sets up some plot that makes a lot of sense and a lot of promise for what's to come.

As with any star rating I give, this is enjoyment factor.  I would go see it again."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Intro to Phase 5 and a great standalone! While it is lacking some of the heart that made the first two so loveable, it is action packer and performances by everyone are great. Kathryn Newton does great for her first outing as Cassie Lang and Jonathan Majors is amazing as Kang. Paul Rudd is always a national treasure. Funny in the right spots but definitely more serious than his previous appearances in the MCU."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was a little scared to watch it due to the critics ratings.  It surprised me and proved to be worth my time.  I rate the movie a 7.8/10 or 8/10.  Trust me, you can definitely value my opinion. Excited to see what is next."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,I liked Ant-Man bcus he haven‚Äôt changed much from the original. Kane is going to be awesome!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie did a fantastic job of setting up the sheer colossal size of the threat that is Kang.  Jonathan Majors is a FANTASTIC addition to the MCU.  You actually feel Kangs desperation to get out of the Quantum Realm.  The post credit scene was terrifying.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great a very good start for phase 5!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome. Love that new army of hank !!! 9/10
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was a mixed bag. It's not the terrible disaster that many claim it to be. But, it's definitely sloppy, flawed, and at times, boring. Too much back story that requires long exposition slowed the film down in the middle and the fantastical nature of the quantum realm was TOO detached and TOO fantastical for me to connect to it. I had to sigh and just go with the craziness. The other two Ant-Man films were SO much more grounded despite having life-sized ants. The actor who played Kang was excellent and compelling, but the script cut his legs out from under him by INTRODUCING the next big supervillain while simultaneously showing us that the good guys already beat him twice in one film. Kang seems poised to suffer from Kylo Ren-ism unfortunately--the cool bad guy that shows up and gets beat every time. Not memorable. But, still, my kids and I laughed at some of the jokes, and I still got some good Ant-Man vibes when the movie wrapped up. So, no, this isn't a disaster, but it's not an improvement on the Ant-Man franchise nor the Marvel franchise. It's just semi-likable and okay. I might be able to watch this one more time to see what I missed, but I doubt I'd ever watch it again after that....ever..."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania is a concept artist's wet dream, and a screenwriters nightmare.  It is visually compelling, with just plain dumb writing.  It's a fantasy so loosely wrapped in science fiction clothing that it falls apart at the slightest whiff of a logical question, like ""how come we're not dead?"" for instance. To which the answer was ""I don't know,"" and then it was never addressed again. A movie this expensive, with this many talented people behind (and in front of) it, surely could have been incredible, and instead it's just something cool to watch for a couple of hours."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"DO NOT BELIEVE THE CRITICS SCORE! I went into this movie with nervous expectations and a bit of a worry because I looked at the critics score before the movie. Definitely not the second worst rotten tomatoes score of the MCU, and it's definitely much higher than the 48% it got! See this movie and judge it yourself.  It's a strong kickoff to phase five and it fits nicely into the MCU. Kang is finally here!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Ignore the critics! Marvel movies are not made for critics - they are made for the fans. If you like Marvel movies you will enjoy this one! Had a very Guardians of the Galaxy feel with the movie taking place almost entirely in the quantum realm. The introduction of Kang did not disappoint and I'm very excited to see him come back. Michelle Pfeiffer played a bigger role than I was expecting and did great.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,The other Ant-MAN movies were better than this. It was just ok.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was exquisite. It definitely flavored my taste buds for Marvel movies. It's a great start to phase 5.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics on this one! It's been a long time since the MCU has made a quality movie like this. Everyone was really good in it, but Jonathan Majors really stole the show as Kang. If you're a fan of the MCU, go see it to support them in making more quality movies, rather than the garbage they've been making for the past couple of years."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"AntManAndTheWaspQuantumania¬†is the case of don‚Äôt listen to the critics and go watch the movie for yourself, I enjoyed watching it and can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next in the franchise"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It started out sort of slow, but once Kang was introduced, the movie's feel gradually picked up and became more suspenseful."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a really fun, trippy movie. I love when the MCU gets weird. This felt like Star Wars with some Dune for good measure. I definitely recommend this!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,effects were amazing!  Story was solid with good action and a little comedy.  Solid movie experience.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, great visual effects!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great affects and great story lots of action
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are wrong. This movie has a fun story, it's funny, well acted, and has real drama and a spectacular villain. I get that they are tired of marvel, but I enjoyed this more than Wakanda Forever."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie‚Ä¶Not the greatest marvel entry but not the worst either. Definitely worth a watch. Take it for what it is‚Ä¶A silly super hero movie. If you take it more serious than that you‚Äôll be sadly disappointed.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Creativity of the different creatures
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Spoiler free review. I think I must have seen a different movie to the many negative reviews or I am a simple minded film goer because my family and I saw Antman and really enjoyed it! Jonathan Majors' understated menace is great! The sfx was stunning in our humble opinion! Like most Marvel things, it is character driven though we did miss the Scott Lang friends! The plot made sense to us at least. Kang, like most MCU villains isn't quite clear cut bad. There's more to him. We went to see a Marvel movie- action, sfx, humour, character focused, and that's what we got. We were entertained throughout. I will be seeking out the negative reviews to see what I missed but if you like Antman, if you liked phase 4, if you like the MCU, then it's for you. I'm also not understanding this superhero fatigue I keep seeing. No one is forcing the public to watch Marvel films so I don't understand the critics. I would love to have it all explained to me. Oh, there are two end credit scenes so stick around!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,I keep hope that Marvel movies can and will get less terrible but the opposite is true. I think its time for Disney and Hollywood in general to look into new and not so washed up ideas.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If I could give it negative stars I would. Terrible, terrible. terrible"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The villain was good. Paul Rudd was exactly as you expect. Michelle Pfeiffer and Evangeline Lilly were poorly written roles. The CGI was too much, too distracting unlike Avatar where it adds to the film.  Disappointed."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was a joy to see. An amazing plot that can be enjoyed even if you havent seen the previous marvel films. I was absolutely enthralled by the performance of every actor, especially Johnathon Majors as Kang the Conqueror. An intimidating, strong, threatening, and thrilling villain. Though the execution of very few scenes may have been unnecessary and slowed down the momentum, it was a film that will definitely stand out for superhero movies. Most will disagree, but I urge you to keep in mind that criticizing marvel movies has become a trend, making the critics stand out and gain attention. If this movie was released 10 years prior, it would be among the best reviewed films of all time. Near perfect story telling, story progression, and a beautiful conclusion, I highly suggest you, lovers of cinematic entertainment, watch this film."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie! The visuals was amazing, all the new characters of the quantum realm was creatively amazing, the story writing could have been better, but still was good enough for me. The highlight of the movie...Johnathan Majors!!! Can't wait to see more of Kang!!!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun Marvel movie. Exactly what you would expect from Ant-Man.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun and well crafted marvel movie. If that makes sense to you, ignore the reviews."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is very well done.  It's the start of phase 5 for the Marvel Universe and tells a good story.  If you want to continue to know what's going on with the overall grand storyline of the MCU, then this movie is definitely one you don't want to miss.  The 3D itself didn't seem that great to me, but how often do you get to see movies in 3D?"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fitting conclusion to the Ant-Man/Wasp trilogy, and a startling and intense beginning to the next Phase of the MCU! Scott and the whole Pym/Van Dyne family are back, but it seems Janet had a lot more going on while she was trapped in the Quantum Realm
A lot of action, a lot of drama, trademark humor, but a palpable sense of a danger from Kang, who is a much bigger and more terrifying threat than Thanos ever was- and MODOK is terrific here! (Who he was is even more surprising!) This movie was great! Had a great time with it, and it dovetails perfectly with events in the Loki series. Stay for both mid- and end-credit scenes!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors was excellent.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The CGI critique is over critical. Visuals were in line with Marvel's other offerings. MODOK took a second to digest but became normal by the time the credits role. Is a fresh entry into Phase 5 focusing on the future of the MCU in comparison to Phase 4's one off story arcs. Jonathan Majors steals the show and excited to see what is to come in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Loki Season 2
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was amazing like, I would watch this again and it has a good balance of seriousness and goofiness"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you like cheezy, bland story telling, with a feel of pure DisneyCGI bliss, than this is the move for you. Such good actors and such a poorly made movie. I'd give it one star if it Jonathan Majors wasn't in it."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The action is good. The cast of the movies are superb. Really enjoyed the movie a lot
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a great way to kickoff phase 5. As much as I love this film the first act is a very big struggle plus the mid credit scene is just bad but the end credit is incredible 10/10
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was good but I do wish they could of done more with a lot of the characters like M.O.D.O.K for instance.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The bad buzz of this movie is totally made up by the critcs. Although it is not an unforgettable movie, it's still really enjoyable, a must watch for an hardcore marvel fan and a fun moment. Masters gives an outstanding performance as Kang and the sub-atomic dimension, with its Star Wars feel and its characters are really cool"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,it was everything I wanted it to be! so much fun!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"There were some cheesy parts, but it was super entertaining. The world building was amazing!"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. Fun, funny. Great cast."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie.... exactly what it should've been. The negative ratings are completely biased.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,It did great at the humor and laughs and also a good conflict but it lacked a good story line and good plot also to little good fighting or good character development also it was not that creative. Marvel can do better then this movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie.  It doesn't deserve the hate the critics are giving it.  Does it have a few issues?  Sure. Nothing as bad as The Eternals or TtDW.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie. Loved the action and the CGI.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie! Jonathan Majors was awesome!!!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,there was a lot of talking not much action
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it. Don't let these ""professional critics"" talk you out of seeing this movie or biasing your own judgement going into it. It's as funny as it needs to be, exciting and visually stunning."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,i like it and thats all that matter for me. go see it for yourself and decide.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Para entretenimento o filme √© bom. CGI bem feito, personagens carism√°ticos e um design gr√°fico muito satisfat√≥rio. Para o universo cinematogr√°fico da Marvel, achei o filme muito pobre. O desenvolvimento dos personagens foi inexistente, apenas o Kang se destaca neste filme. As cenas mais empolgantes s√£o de facto as p√≥s-cr√©ditos. Tenho pena de ver um filme com muito potencial, ser desperdi√ßado com roteiro med√≠ocre."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,No michael pena so it should be a zero but I decided to only watch stupid movies this year and this one definitely qualifies
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,much better than Thor
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,I knew what to expect with an Ant-Man movie. What set this one apart was Jonathan Major's performance as Kang. He was great. It gave a more serious tone to some parts of the movie. I didn't care for Cassie Lang's character too much but I would go see this again for sure.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great action affect totally fun.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A great prequel to the upcoming avenger movies
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed Quantumania... I love seeing new worlds, like the quantum realm.. Jonathan Majors killed it as Kang, and it was nice for an Ant Man movie to be a bit more on the serious / arc setup side, although I did miss the likes of Luis!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not perfect but, pretty darn good.  The only thing I missed was Luis."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"We are all just a bunch of giant civilized ants if you think about it. I mean, that's what the whole movie is about‚Ä¶I think. Other than the fact that I was crying laughing out of confusion and second hand embarrassment for the actors, I just don't know what to take away. I will never watch this movie again, and I don't feel hopeful for the trajectory of the Marvel plot line."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie that lags a bit in the middle, but otherwise sets up a great new phase for the MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang's character is awesome, so well definitely and different from the villains in previous Marvel movies."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The story dragged. Great action and all around movie!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this installment in the series. It's more serious and darker than the 2 previous movies. They did a decent job exploring other layers of Scott's personality, especially through the family dynamic. Jonathan Majors is phenomenal as usual and sets the tone for Phase 5. The 2 post credit scenes have me excited for what's to come."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's fun but a bit underwhelmed.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang was adapted and presented PERFECTLY by Jonathan Majors, the CGI was actually perfect, MODOK was so fun, and the film was amazing overall!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good, explain how the begins!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If it weren't for the visuals, solid cast of actors, and Jonathan Majors, this movie would be an all-time flop. The CG is mostly pretty spectacular. The acting is good as per usual with Marvel movies. But, the writing is atrocious, which is now a trend with Marvel films, and it just keeps getting worse. Kevin Feige should never hire another comedy writer to work on these projects ever again. Too many jokes, the jokes are mistimed, and some are just plain bad. The fair amount of awesome moments in this movie save it from being overtaken by bad, tension-killing jokes. There are stakes in this film, that's great to see. Although, there's a surprising lack of conflict in this movie. Feels like a movie intended for kids and ONLY kids. EXTREMELY formulaic, takes 0 risks, is hyper-conservative with its choices throughout, wastes a metric ton of potential. Worst of all, the movie is entirely predictable and is basically just one giant ad for the next movie. You will know what happens before it happens. Many trite, cringe-inducing moments unfortunately. Jonathan Majors singlehandedly carries and elevates a subpar script and thinly written Kang to the finish line."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Kane was awesome can't wait to see what else he does
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie. Not like the first two but still had some fun whimsical moments. Johnathan Majors was amazing. Like every super hero movie there are some plot holes but helped tied some MCU pieces together.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It's definitely the best Antman movie. It's an absolute blast from start to finish.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A good movie action packed has lots of mystery and drama and moved it I really recommend you see it.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not sure what people expect from an Ant-Man movie. It was fun and the time flew by.
Ant-man moved his story forward and Kang is a very different villain that Thanos. Definitely was missing Michael Pe√±a and his team. Missed that localness of the 1 and 2."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie! Adjustments to the ending and how the plots falling action ensued would have taken the film to another level (the level we all wanted). That said, better than anything from Phase 4 by far AND the first 2 Antman movies. In a league of its own compared to the first 2!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I don‚Äôt understand the hate this movie was solid kang was amazing post credits good funny when It had to be
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great start to phase 5! I really enjoyed this movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Go see the movie. Family saw the movie today and all came out enjoying the movie. It's an Ant Man movie and it set up the multiverse war coming in a real way. We all laughed a ton, it was paced well, it was a fun ride. Not what critics want from a Marvel movie and really learning to not trust them."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have no idea why the critics are giving this movie such bad reviews.  I thought the film was thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the MCU.  As for those critics, they can go watch some obscure and boring art film."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania was great fun, Saturday afternoon entertainment"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Jonathan Majors' Kang is epic!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched today this movie and even though it didn t kick of phase 5 as promised, Kang and Ant Man were good."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Film is a must see! Great dialogue, storyline as well as character arc and villain. But Surprisingly the thing that caught my eye the most was not Kang it was actually the cgi which was on avatars level! As far as Kang goes he had me exited for the future of the MCU he was threatening, menacing and cold blooded! Ant man and friends were entertaining as well as they a unique challenge to overcome and too see them all fight together was great, I like that Cassie now has a bigger role in the MCU as she now where's a bug themed suit. What I didn't like about this film was modok as he just simply looked ridiculous and the film wants the audience to take him seriously I mean come on the dude has a head the size of the daily bugle! So 9/10 go see this one in theaters and definitely stick around for the credits!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I wish Kang was in more scenes.  Of course, he's my favorite Marvel villain, so I'm bias.  Looking forward to seeing more of him.  Fun movie overall.  Pleasant visuals."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Doesn't deserve any of the hate it's getting at all. The critics have no context on anything they're talking about because they're not true comic fans. They're critics, if your looking for a compelling drama or any other non marvel film then please don't watch. But if your a huge MCU fan like me, this is great start to phase 5. Any comparison to Thor Love and Thunder is ridiculous. This film has heart, a compelling story, and does an amazing job and introducing our next huge villain, 5 stars all the way. Critics can eat me"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is this a perfect movie? No. Not by any means. But I still don't understand why all these critics hate it so much. It does have problems with not taking itself seriously at times, but that's nothing compared to Thor: Love and Thunder. Was the CGI perfect? No. And it's unfortunate that we have to discuss Marvel's CGI. It should be perfect by default. But instead there are a couple of shots in this movie that are unrealistic or fake looking. I've heard many people complain about how M.O.D.O.K. looks too weird. Well I've got news for you, he's supposed to. Kang is one of those villains, at least in my opinion, where I want to see him beaten. I want to see our hero triumph and Kang loose. Here, we get a variant of Kang being destroyed. But instead of permanently stopping Kang, they've only just unleashed Kang's fury. There's also a lot of fun and crazy characters in this movie, and it truly elevates the Quantum Realm from just a place to a thriving civilization that seems fun to explore. Like at Avengers Campus in Disneyland or something like that. Overall, a harmless movie that's very enjoyable and fits into the mainstream of the MCU more than I expected. 8.5/10."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely phenomenal! As a huge Ant-Man fan, this movie was a big deal to me, and in no ways did it disappoint. There are a few things I would‚Äôve liked to see more of, but everything that *was* there was perfect. ANTS!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Major's performance as Kang was incredible! What a way to set up the next threat to the MCU!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, critics are full of it for rating she-hulk higher."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,a great movie filled with lots of action.  stay and watch after the credits so as not to miss anything
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors As kang  the best villain so far.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The CGI and jokes were on point . Nice plot too especially in the credits .
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Estuvo buena, una variante de Kang bastante interesante, el multiverso que explican y todo lo del reino cu√°ntico, est√° recomendable para pasar el rato y m√°s si te interesa la ciencia ficci√≥n en toda su palabra."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was realy mid. I havent felt any deep emotions most of the time.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect way to kick start phase 5 of the MCU.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really don't understand the hate that the professional reviewers have for this movie.  If you are a professional movie reviewer and can't follow the plot of a comic book movie, you need another profession.  This movie does a good job of both finishing the Ant-Man trilogy, and starting Phase 5 of the MCU.  Kang was very believable as a psychopathic manipulative egomaniac.  He is a much better villain than Thanos.  The family tension between Janet and Hank/Hope was palpable.  Scott's love for Cassie, and Cassie's idealism were played perfectly.  The Quantum Realm was fully realized as a bizarre universe in and of itself. The only thing I didn't like was that there was one memorable line from the trailer that was in the movie after the twist, so I knew that there was more movie coming.  Solid 4 out of 5 stars."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Do watch it if you've followed Phase 4 closely and you'll see the other side of Kang! Its more of an introduction to Kang and what could happen in the MCU in the coming years in Ant-Man's style
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was good.on some parts
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,i LOVED THE SPECIAL EFFECTS!!  and the MUSIC!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm not a fan of marvel or any comic book movies BUT my boyfriend is. I have to say this was such a well made movie. 10/10 and it made me laugh! Family friendly indeed.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm not sure why critics don't like this movie but at least the low reviews caused me to go in without high expectations.

I thought the movie was good. It had humor as you'd expect, decent action and at least one great cameo. People have criticized the special effects but I thought they were great. The artists did a great job building a fantastic world full of interesting creatures and inhabitants. I was impressed with the diversity of ""aliens"", many of which were very unique looking and original (living organic buildings that can fly and shoot and are kinda cute? Cool!) If you can look at this imaginary world as being and alternate sub-atomic universe you can truly enjoy it visually and avoid being tied to the idea that things have to look hyper realistic or grounded in reality. I mean, it's the quantum realm man!

With the talent of the cast I would have liked to have seen more heart and drama. There was the potential for lots of that which was perhaps wasted on a clean and happy ending for all. No one really sacrifices anything so it all seems a little too convenient in the end.

Quantamania doesn't fail miserably in any category. However it never really excels in any either, falling short of it's full potential which is often just an ant's length away. 

Worth a trip to the theaters for an entertaining romp with friends and family."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good Marvel fun and a nice introduction to a more brutal Kang.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked this movie. It was a great way to lead into the next couple of marvel movies involving Kang. And like the other antman movies you can definitely be guaranteed a good couple of laughs amongst the action
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely a fun movie. This movie is Star Wars meets Marvel! Great acting, great action, good story. Jonathan majors is amazing as Kang. Katherine Newton is also great as Cassie and I‚Äôm excited to see where the MCU takes her. Overall this was a fun and exciting movie to watch."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not a great start for phase 5. Kang just seems easily defeatable with how little effort Ant-Man had to put in. There were no stakes. No lives on the line at any point.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie special effects and study line
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A great start to phase 5 of marvel looking forward to the next marvel movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great and Kang was amazing
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Really strong start to phase 5. The world building is starting to pay off. Kang is awesome and the movie overall flew by as it was so enjoyable
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great visual effects. Very fun movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Once again great acting, I did feel like they were reaching a bit and didnt see how it all tied into all the other movies. I am curious to see how all the timelines come into play though. Best like I must say is .I am not a dick!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good package deal. Comedy, father-daughter moments, amazing cinematography, solid story for a solo movie, and last but not the least, Jonathan Majors as Kang who stole the show."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Here comes the conqueror! On top of that this was a delightful movie with lots of fun weirdness that that was balanced perfectly with the looming threat. I think they managed to tell an incredible story while setting up a chilling and absolutely awesome villain to kick some avenger butt over the next few years.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie. Great story, fun, beautiful CGI. Kang is epic"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Better than wakanda forever. That's it. Movie accomplished.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a good, fun popcorn movie. Unfortunately, character development (except for Kang) is non-existent. Characters from previous Ant-Man films are the same from beginning to the end which is a bummer."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast-moving movie that is never boring, if only a bit bewilderingly confusing. Most of the movie takes place in Sub-Atomica, so 90% takes place in fully CGI backgrounds, which was a bit much at times, but YMMV."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved kang the conqueror can‚Äôt wait to see him in Loki season 2
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off Phase 5 of the MCU to a fantastic start. The way the film builds upon aspects of the Quantum Realm only justifies that this the beginning of Kang and the Multiverse Saga. The visuals are stunning, and the action scenes are memorable throughout the film. Paul Rudd is charismatic as always as the titular character, as well as standout roles from Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors. Both embrace the films weirdness (in a good way) to emphasise that the next big bad of the MCU is coming. 

Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. It definitely exceeds expectations. 4 stars."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,CGI is good. Disregard negative critics.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is something different and new.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun ride. Cool Aliens. Kang was good villain. Some of the special effects needed more work. Good start to phase 5.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Felt like a kids show. Not a single joke landed. It had me questioning why a movie like this was even necessary. Although we are told how high the stakes are, never for a second did they feel higher than those of The Winter Soldier or Iron Man 3, both of which are movies set on earth without the mumbojumbo that comes with making a movie about the quantum realm or the multiverse. The latter of which was used perfectly in no way home. This movie doesn't feel like the third movie in a franchise and I will never believe that it's set in the same franchise as Daredevil aka the peak of superhero content."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Well I guess if you're a huge star wars fan you might love it. I kind feel it was somewhat boring and really it felt like I was watching a rip off of star wars. It got a little better towards the end but overall I feel like my money was wasted.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There was no plot, M.O.D.O.K. was in the film just because he wasn't in one for a long time."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don't know what's happening with the Marvel Universe. I may just start waiting for Disney+. Did not like this one.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Continues the story telling and great acting.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ehhh marvel at this point is pretty much dying/about to be dead. Not worth the watch, pirate it or watch it on streaming sites."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Started out slow, but picked up the pace after 30 minutes"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pretty disappointing . . . Where was Luis and the crew?
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania try to do EPIC for the MCU, but writers doesn't have courage to do yet. Jonathan Majors is the new perfect casting for Marvel Studios, but Kang, the Conqueror can be more agressive and massive. By the way, Kathryn Newton has a good journey as Cassie Lang in the Quantum Realm."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Someone saw the cantina scene from Star Wars and made it into a full length movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was great, Kang!!!!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,it was very good.great action and suspense.it was better then thor love and thunder
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,thought this was the best out of the 3 antman movies. entertaining and visually captivating.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Who would've thought that a hero called ""Ant-Man"" would succeed in a trilogy? I massively enjoyed the first one but found the second one to be quite forgettable. I loved the idea of smaller stake stories for Ant-Man films. It was a little surprising to hear that Ant-Man 3 would have bigger stakes as I didn't find this to suit the character. Is this a good entry for the little guy or quantum garbage?

The greatest highlight of this film is the antagonist, Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is fearsome and menacing with a terrific performance by Jonathan that reminds me of Darth Vader. He steals the show in every scene, to the point that I was actually rooting for him. I am also glad that his performance is vastly different to the variant we saw in the Loki (2021) show. I can't wait to see more of Kang in the future! In terms of performance, I also enjoyed seeing more of Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne. She was barely in the second Ant-Man film but here she is front and centre. She shines in her performance and perfectly illustrates the guilt and fear her character is experiencing. Paul Rudd is still charming and charismatic as Scott Lang. His relationship with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) is still the main core of his character. We get to see 'some' serious moments with his character which was nice to see.

Another thing I liked was the overall design of the Quantum Realm. The world and the living beings in the Quantum Realm were interesting. It had a very Star Wars/Mad Max feel to it with the blend of sci-fi, deserts and alien-like creatures. The 3rd act of the movie is also quite entertaining. For the most part, it's a giant CGI battle with lots of things happening on screen but it is fun to watch. I especially loved seeing Kang in action because we get to see how much of a beast he is compared to previous villains. 

However, the writing is very weak. There are a lot of silly dialogues that just made me roll my eyes. It doesn't help that for some reason Marvel is still doing forced unnecessary humour. If this story is meant to be higher stakes then make it serious! The quips get overly repetitive. The first half is a little dull too with minimal interesting things happening. It doesn't take until over halfway through the movie to actually see Kang. Additionally, the ending was disappointing. It is very bland and safe which is a shame as this film could've delivered a shocking and memorable ending. This movie is also meant to build up hype for the next Avengers film but that ending fails to do even that. 

MODOK is also in this film and it is a pointless addition. Not only do they change the character completely from their comic counterpart, but their role in the story is also absolutely irrelevant. Could take them out of the story and nothing will change. Despite the film being called Ant-Man and the Wasp, both Scott Lang and Hope feel like side characters in their own film. They have no character development and are just kind of there for the ride. Janet is more of a main character than them. I also don't like this trend in these recent Marvel films of Marvel characters looking out for these young characters. Cassie is the next in this trend and is also an annoying character like many of them before. I think Kathryn Newton is fine in her role but her character just isn't written well to be likeable enough for me to care. This is also a very CGI-heavy film and for the most part, it is okay but there are definitely times when it looks rough. The editing, especially during action sequences, can be really bad. They tend to do too many quick cuts during action sequences and for some reason use the shaky cam in 2023!

Overall, Ant-Man 3 is a bit disappointing. There was a lot of potential for this to be something great but the execution is quite poor. This isn't a great start to Phase 5 and I am getting worried about the future of the MCU. They need to do a better job at making people hyped for the next Avengers-level threat as this film isn't making me think this is a threat equal to or better than Thanos. I'm hoping future Marvel films start building up this new threat because they need to show us that this new threat is worthy of our attention."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantimania set up Phase 5 pretty well. The action and special effects were well done. Johnathan Majors as Kang, elevates evey scene that he's in. I recommend this if you want to continue your MCU journey. BLACK PANTHER and BLACK PANTHER WAKANDA FOREVER are still my favorite MARVEL STUDIOS movies."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was badass!! CGI was dope! Just not enough Kang at the end of the day. Don‚Äôt like how they ended MODOK. 
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"SPOILER ALERT‚Ä¶.

Lots of fun: real Marvel comics feel.  Awesome elevation of the characters for screen.  A+ acting all around.  And MODOK!!! What a laugh!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, exciting. One of the better Marvel movies"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The CGI is so cool omgggg.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wonder, is this a stars wars movie or a marvel movie. Feels like a mesh, forced and convoluted."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok. Slow start intro to phase 5.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought I was great, very well done! I love the interactions with the characters & seeing certain characters return! It‚Äôs also refreshing that it was the first marvel movie I‚Äôve seen in a while with no ‚Äúwoke‚Äù concepts/messages! I love the Antman series & it continues to be my favorite!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie lots of action and hilarious at times.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was entertaining.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,An enjoyable movie that doesn't deserve the amount of hate it's getting.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Honest review - the writing is a mess the realm was a CGI mess... you could honestly never watch this movie and still knows what happens in other movies... Most definitely a phase 4 movie... A good watch when it's out on Disney plus
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't get the hate honestly, it's a really good movie, Jonathon Majors absolutely killed it as kang, comedy wasn't as forced as love and thunder and was actually funny. Great movie 9.5/10."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A experi√™ncia multiversal abordando o reino qu√¢ntico √© a prova que a Marvel est√° a cada filme mais pr√≥xima de nos mostrar as incurs√µes e o multiverso de uma maneira √∫nica. A atua√ß√£o do ator do Kang nos d√° um vislumbre sobre como todas as suas variantes ser√£o. A Janet, Hope, Cassie e Scott est√£o muito maduros nesse filme, diferente do Hank."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Although Cassie in general and Janet's refusal to tell what dangers lie in the Quantum u. very annoying the movie was still a great ride. It felt like a great sci-fantasy adventure.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good entertainment with no null in the action. Beautiful visuals as well.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Each Ant-Man movie gets better - great story and cast
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great into to the Kang dynasty !
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Potential Spoilers ahead:

My review of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania -

So, first off: Ignore the negative reviews. This isn't a perfect movie. It doesn't rank in the top ten Marvel movies. And that's fine. 

However, it is a lot of fun and a worthy first chapter in phase 5. 

But let's take a step back here for a moment. Phase 4 was weird. It was a mishmash of movies, all with their own themes and it didn't offer up a single clear cohesive storyline between movies. It had a taste of sci-fi, horror, drama, and tragedy. It was also the first time in the franchise that they tried their hand at episodic tv shows (Wandavision, Loki, Ms. Marvel). Phase 4 disappointed frequently because it was much like connective marrow. Yes, there were a few highlights but was following a very difficult act (Endgame). 

So, onto phase 5. I think people expected this first chapter would be MUCH better. It isn't. But it isn't bad either. It has its light and funny moments with Paul Rudd. Michael Douglas has a bit more comedy here and Bill Murray has a brief appearance which amounts to a glorified cameo. Michelle Pfeiffer has a substantial role (nice to see an older actress get more to do in an a superhero movie), but unfortunately Evangeline Lilly is purely wasted and almost unnecessary. Something tells me she was trimmed out of the film and her actions were replaced by Kathryn Newton (who replaced Emma Fuhrmann -- we noticed) as daughter Cassie Lang. 

But the real treat of this movie is that of Jonathan Majors. He steals every second he is on screen and he really comes across as a powerhouse threat. Since his appearance in Loki, he has shown that he understands his character and the role(s) he plays. As these movies are plotted out years in advance, something tells me that he might be one of the few people who understands his character's arc between now and the end of his tenure (similar to how Alan Rickman knew Snape's journey in Harry Potter). 

Overall - the movie is trippy. Director Peyton Reed (who directed the previous two Ant-Man movies, and Bring it On), really knows how to paint a beautiful and surreal scene. With the right scriptwriters behind him, he could do great things. Disney really should give him the helm of a Star Wars trilogy, with David Filoni writing. Oh wait, he already had that. Reed directed chapter 10 and chapter 16 of the Mandalorian. He directed the episode where Luke Skywalker showed up. After what I saw today, I would love to see him direct a full trilogy (maybe set a thousand years before the stories we know and love). 

Anyway, back to Ant-Man. It's a fun first chapter into a smaller universe with some brilliant casting, wonderful visuals and sometimes silly dialogue. Stick around for a mid-credit scene that expands the Marvel universe considerable and an end-credit scene that serves as little more than a teaser of a future related marvel project (but still worth watching)."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Grew intro to kang and super funny
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I‚Äôm not sure what the critics did not like. It was fun and fresh. I put it up there with Thor Ragnarok!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,honestly....not bad at all. Based on what I was reading I was totally prepared to not like it. Surprisingly it was easy to follow and quite enjoyable. Would I see it again...no. Do I think it did a nice job of setting up future Marvel sagas...yes. Missed Michael Pena and the crew....they would have added some entertaining stuff. Overall pleasantly surprised. 
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was epic movie.
Good battles and very nice action.
Ant-man win against Kang ?... Well almost all ant family would die and Kang would run away, that's how it supposed to end to be honest... 
But anyway it was a lot fun , love it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy entretenida. Refrescante
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great could of had more of story too it and could have been a bit longer
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too much CGI, weak storyline"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sinceramente, eu n√£o via um filme t√£o bom assim desde homem aranha sem volta para casa. Hoje em dia os f√£s da marvel s√≥ gostam do filme se ele tiver uma participa√ß√£o especial ou que algu√©m morra"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved every minute of this film it was definitely amazing
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The new Ant-Man movie did not have a positive impact, which indicates that Marvel should be more attentive to future releases, as this is not the first time it has happened. In my opinion, the highlight of the movie was Kang, even though the movie was not directly about him. Something that shocked me a lot was the lack of investment in character development and CGI, as well as other things, like the script, for example. There were no significant changes in Scott (Ant-Man) and MODOK was not faithful to the comics. With the expectation surrounding this movie, it could not have been so generic."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The storyline was great and kept me tuned for what would come next. Jonathan Majors played his role as Kang the Conqueror very well, I can't wait for when he takes on more of the variations."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally! The plot made sense, new characters fit and worked well in the universe. Fight scenes were excellent, and no technology just for the sake of new stuff. Totally enjoyed it, and looking forward to where it's going next."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel phase 4 still continues.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was really weird.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What made Antman a thrilling and exciting character and his support is now completely gone, Luis and Kurt are nowhere to be found and in summary it's a good filler movie and that's really all it is. The only character development/arc is really Scott. Hope added nothing, hank doesn't have the charm he used to, Janet is okay but they've completely tarnished Cassie's character. What set Antman apart from the rest of the mcu was his relationship with cassie and with his family and his two buddies but now those two things are gone and what's left is drawn out movie with some dollar store Star Wars universe that has little creativity for what they could've done."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is really good, it's not perfect, but it's a great entertainment"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Much Better than we hoped it would be! Looking forward to the next Marvel movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was amazing. The action was great. The cast was brilliant. It did a great job kicking off Phase 5 of the MCU. It‚Äôs worth seeing with your family. üëç‚ù§Ô∏èüòÄ
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Honestly this movie is one of the worst mcu movies yet. There‚Äôs so many plot holes and parts that are just ridiculous. Only good part were the end credit scenes
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually striking, but kinda corny."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Weak and confusing cgi, too much silent and weak dialogues. I actually dozed off a bit during the movie... But take my opinion with a grain of salt..."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The characters are creative and fun. The ending with the big fight was a favorite part. The Quantum Realm was beautiful and good quality. 3-d quality rocked!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Buen inicio para esta nueva fase. Recomendada.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it!!! I was engaged the entire time. I few small things I didn't like were Cassie's speech and her acting at times so I'd give it a 4.6/5 stars. Definitely worth a watch!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a movie! ... Full of heart, mad world building, epic CGI landscapes... Funny as HELL moments you laugh out loud too and one REALLY intense villain you can't get enough of... ü§å

I really do not understand the bad press or critic response to this as that was a brilliant introduction to phase 5 and the comic accuracy with some characters was spot on and amazingly done imo üôè good solid film with big stakes and set pieces but still felt like an Ant-Man flick throughout the madness and hype. 

Jonathan Majors, wow. Just wow sir. ü§å That IS Kang.

And the emotional father daughter moments had me tearing up in deep and funny moments alike. Be warned daddy's to daughters. It'll hit ya right in the feels ‚ù§Ô∏è

No spoilers here and please don't spoil in the comments if you have seen it as people need to go in fresh to this flick and just have a good time with it. Lower your expectations and you WONT be disappointed... I think the bad press is people forgetting this is an INTRODUCTION to phase 5, we aren't on our main course yet and them greedy guts critics need to remember that ü§£ü§∑üèªüòú"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't get why it got bad reviews, but I enjoyed it. Lots of fun and exciting moments. It's probably my second-fave Ant Man film of the trilogy."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Glad I went and saw this movie myself. Had a great time with it. Kang completely STOLE the show, wow Jonathan Majors. Interesting direction the MCU is now going in. I would recommend this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it and i will watch it again :)
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than Dr. Strange and Multiverse of madness.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Like the action the jokes Paul Rudd was amazing
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Em geral eu diria que √© um filme raso, me senti vendo um resumo do filme. Roteiro fraco, partes que poderiam ser aprofundadas n√£o foram aproveitadas, foi muito facilmente resolvido. N√£o me senti conectado com os personagens, n√£o senti nem que tive oportunidade pra isso. O roteiro em si estava muito ""bagun√ßado""."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kang by far is one of the weakest villains we've seen in a Marvel movie of late. We're shown his ruthlessness through exposition?! 

Ant man litteraly solos him and his entire Army."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watched with my 11yr old son have seen all the marvel movies and it was one of the best, it's a great movie, awesome story line ,with a great list of actors who did a great job ,brilliant action scene's with some huge high points while keeping it real and within the scope of the story"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant fun movie, worse than Eternals? Give me a break! Seems to be an active MCU trashing campaign going on. More proof critics know jack all and that unless it's some weird ponsy film with subtitles then it's not any good."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Maybe not a top tier movie but definitely exciting and fun to watch and give it a 8/10
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The best mcu film they've realised since endgame do not trust the critics asll the actors do an amazing job the story is extremely mesmerising and amazing they build tensions perfectly and make you feel for scott throughout the entire movie whilst making you deathly afraid of kang i would definetly recommend watching this in cinema as soon as you can and to watch both end credit scenes.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie for the Family, definitely will inspire daughters to listen to their fathers üëç"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you're expecting light, this isn't it. Scott is learning what it means to really be an Avenger, and mythology has been put in place for the coming phases.
But it's good. It is a rollercoaster. Happy, scary, weird, full of exciting moments, and plenty of mind trips.
But I want the Ant Man Family to be taken seriously and I think this is the start."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Ignore the critics. This was a great movie. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Much better than most phase 4 movies.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Thought it was amazing. Kang is powerful and scary as hell and a great introduction. Mind blown as to what is to come. People giving this a bad rating are the same ones who read the dictionary for fun.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Sadly Ant-Man And The Wasp Quantumania didnt finish out the Ant-Man trilogy like was hoping. Instead all it did was open a gate for the audience to get introduced to Kang. I went there for Ant-Man and got nothing but green screen stages, and Kang. 
6/10, probably will go down over time for sure. Definitely the most forgettable experience I've had out of a Marvel movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too much over the top green screen
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie moved the MCU on to bigger and better things and was enjoyable to watch. Not what i totally expected and was happy it wasn't.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was good. Could have been better but hey this is Marvel. The story was cool, twisty, crazy. Some humor was cool. Kang is such a badass really"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it! Give me more Kang!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good film in my opinion. It‚Äôs enjoyable from start to finish with some heartfelt moments. But it‚Äôs a good starting film that is a great introduction to the next big bad in the marvel films.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,it's a fun comic book movie reminds me of old random back issues critics are looking way deep into everything i didn't get bored throughout the whole movie either so yeah not every movie has to be endgame
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Another average marvel film.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Disney is just milking money out of popular franchises (Marvel, Star Wars, etc.). All of the movies/content they create is aimed to give people a dopamine (wow) response. Wow bright colors, wow CGI, wow more characters, wow explosions, wow more jokes. None of it has any depth or story. All Disney creates are dopamine triggers, not stories."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very fun movie! Visually stunning. Good character work and Johnathan Majors is incredible as Kang
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the characters and show how also emotional they are
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,La pelicula es muy mala la verdad
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thrill ride from start to finish. Heart, laughs and chills throughout. Will definitely check this one out again!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible! So much fun & really gorgeous!! Interesting after credits scenes, too (x2)"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie a bit slow at times but overall very satisfied with it
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie marvel movie since endgame
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super Dope, Funny, and Entertaining from the Start. It was üî•üî•üî•üî•‚Ä¶.overall a great movie. Modok was hilarious. Kang is vicious!!! ‚Ä¶.."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,My seat recline did not work. I‚Äôd like 1 of my 5 tickets refunded
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una gran pel√≠cula de s√∫per h√©roes, no entiendo en qu√© punto todo el mundo se volvi√≥ cr√≠tico de cine de arte y pretenden ver la perfecci√≥n en esta clase de pel√≠culas.. A disfrutar esta gran era de los s√∫per h√©roes!!!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Wasn't bad but could've been better... still a good movie and Kang did not disappoint
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,By the end of it you'll know where phase 5 is going It was an enjoyable ride I feel like it had more control than doctor strange 2. But if you're not going in thinking it's going to be a grammy Award-winning movie you are going to enjoy yourself
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was very fun and exciting. Had the humour you'd expect from an antman movie. Kang was super intimidating.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great entertainment movie. Did not need to know alot about Kang history to enjoy. They did a good job filling in background to understand story line. Humor was good.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it! 
(Spoilers)
Kang felt genuinely menacing. There was lots of crazy stuff they wouldn't have been able to do in earlier films. The twist with MODOK was hilarious!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Mind blowing visuals. Decent story line that made time fly by.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"NON SPOILER REVIEW OF ANTMAN & THE WASP QUANTUMANIA 

Synopsis: 
Ant-Man and the Wasp find themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that pushes them beyond the limits of what they thought was possible.

My Thoughts:
If you've watched any of the other Antman films you know they're not Avengers level movies. However, Kang is and he lives up to the hype. He's not your typical mustache twirling villain. Kang is a calm calculating and ruthless. This creates a scenario where Scott Lang is ridiculously overpowered by Cain and it's forced to do a job for him. 

I enjoyed this film. My expectations were not high so I wasn't disappointed. In fact I was entertained by the bizarre world of the Quantum Realm. There were a few jokes but it wasn't as silly as Thor Love and Thunder. But for the most part things are deadly serious. Kang is not playing any games and he beats the goofy outta Scott. The storyline is easy to follow, although things don't pick up until Kang shows up. 

While this isn't a top tier Marvel film it is a fun watch and worth the price for Jonathan Majors alone. The two post credit scenes are BIG and have dire consequences for the greater Marvel Universe to come. 

I recommend this film. 

Grade:"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,thought this was a great lead up to other marvel movies..cant wait til the other excited for whats to come. enjoyed it a lot
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Compared to other Marvel movies, it wasn‚Äôt memorable for me. It fell flat in several areas, and the quip humor of every character is overplayed. This was supposed to be a serious movie with so much on the line. The after credit scenes were better than the entire movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I watched the movie in 3D. The movie was amusing, entertaining if only to see the artistic creativity, bright colors and the alien creatures The multiverse quantaverse premise is a little choppy to try and follow but I had a good time laughing often. Loved the giant ants.  Fun to see Michelle Peiffer, Michael Douglass in an action film."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good movie and I liked the plot
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,That‚Äôs was Amazing ü§©
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun, standard Marvel fare. Fast paced, action, multiverse, some corny, but still funny lines. Stay for the post credits, mid and end. Sets up season 2 of a popular marvel show on Disney plus and phase 5 films."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was below average at best.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was ok.  Not a good start to phase 5 in my opinion
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,God enough the Marvel movies keep getting worse and worse. Who wrote this a 5 year old
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"+ Really good, fun without being stupid. I hope the Ant Team continues in the MCU
- How many times did Scott say 'Cassie'?"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely worth the watch. The new characters were also hilarious, but didn‚Äôt take away from the plot. "
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Tiresome movie. Bunch of things happening ""just because""."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had a good time. Thought it was fast paced enough. Wouldve loved to see any-man die so there could be some stakes but, fun either way."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie. The action scenes were good.  Johnathan Majors did an excellent job.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Great visual effects. Lack of character development and lack of secondary characters or parallel story line to keep it interesting. It was a slog. Paul Rudd did a good job and kept the movie afloat. Michael Douglas' character took an interesting turn as a ""back seat"" old man/comedy relief."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,you can watch this movie for free now just click in this link(https://t.ly/JCjB)
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I am a well known Ant Man fan.  Bought the comics in the 1960's I've been around a while. Lobbied for marvel to make an ant man film
Until they did . Too bad that they
Made this mess : it was all over the map without landing anywhere. A total waste of my time and money. So sad to see the character devolve into a dung heap like this movie . Be careful what you wish for"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The visuals were great, the quantum realm looked fantastic, Kang was a great character and I can't wait to see more of him. With all of that being said, the story was just really bland. Scott and Cassie's relationship just did not feel genuine for some reason, and the Wasp did not even feel like a main character in the movie. Some of the humor in this movie was pretty stale as well. Overall, this movie was just bland and its not the best start to Phase 5."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a good marvel film. Not great, but nowhere as bad as the critics think. This was a good setup for the Kang story line, good action, some funny parts, on the whole entertaining."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's an Ant-Man movie and pretty much sticks to the formula of that while also playing into the MCU.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie some people may not like it because it's very different from the last two Ant-man movies. I had a lot of fun watching this movie
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,The MCU cash grab is over I think. That was bad. I mean bad on every level. I hated Moonfall but prefer it to this one. Both stupid as hell. 
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Entertains but these all CGI fantasy worlds aren't my favourite MCU ones. Kathryn Newton is a good addition. I guess comic books and the associated movies need a massive baddie like Thanos and now Kang but for me these big boss villains are a bit tedious. Michelle Pfeiffer finally gets something to do in the MCU but Evangeline Lily is probably the 2 time title character with the least to do. She's got short hair. That's about it!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me encanta es un buen proyecto para iniciar la fase 5 , todo esta bien la trama es entretenida lo unico desepcionante es M.O.D.O.K y un poco el CGI pero es buenisima la disfrutas no es la joyita de marvel pero te devuelve a la experiencias de aquellos 2010 es hermosa el CGI no es lo mejor pero tampoco es como el de thor 4 este producto es bueno y la verdad te recuerda a ant man 1 :)"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"liked the humor and set up a next movie. told a good story. Was excellent entertaininment.

dislike: they Did not mention the Micronauts, the heroes on the subatomic universe."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw Ant Man and The Wasp Quantumania today, and it is the absolute wildest, wonkiest, and most out of this world fun-filled Ant Man film ever!  Taking place almost entirely in the quantum realm, the film is loaded with mind boggling visuals and an amazing array of characters, as well as introduce the MCU's newest big bad bad guy, Kang The Conqueror, brilliantly played by actor Jonathan Majors. I will only say that if you thought Thanos was a bad guy, you haven't seen Kang yet!  The movie is loaded with incredible action sequences and plenty of humor and wit, plus great performances by Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfieffer, and especially Kathryn Newton as Scott Lang's grown up daughter Cassie. There is also a surprise return bad guy, and even a short but memorable performance by Bill Murray!  Let me say that as usual, Rotten Tomatoes is full of it as far as giving this film a low rating! Ant Man and The Wasp Quantumania is 100% a definite must see, and if you can, see this one in IMAX! This is a great start to the newest MCU phase and I highly recommend it!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, action and right amount/kind of funny"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"To put it plainly, story was terrible.  I think Disney is just trying to pump out movies as fast as they can to try and cash in on the Marvel movies.   So sad to watch them destroy what Stan built."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know why he critics were so harsh with the movie. I really enjoyed it. Its a good way to start out phase 5. Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd were great in it.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exciting .. love Paul Rudd .. just a likable actor . A little confusing
At times .. but overall fun . Definitely see it in 3D"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Although the plot was sometimes a bit hard to follow, I was thoroughly entertained."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was a fun ride. My kids couldn't wait to see it again. Loved it.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics are out of their minds!  I loved every minute of this movie. Kang is a next level villain. Can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next !üòé
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Better than Thor Love & Thunder. By far. Also my favorite Ant-man movie. Kang is dope. Don't understand the critical hate tho.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good movie. I give 4 starsüòÄ
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good effects and sound for a theater movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Marvel movie since Spider-Man No Way Home! The critics are are clearly being too harsh, the movie was amazing, funny, spectacular and will pull on your heart strings. Go see it! Very important to the future on the MCU!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Lots of action and some comedy as well. The special effects were top notch. Well worth it to go see. Nice start to phase 5 of the marvel universe.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Feels like the start of something big. Humour wasn't overdone and fit all the right places.

The story feels fresh and it wasn't just a tick box excursion."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Marvel movies! Loved it. Don‚Äôt miss it!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Surely imperfect, but entertaining, visually impressive, and great acting. Story-wise I think it will look better in hindsight after we see WHY the events of this movie were more important than they might currently feel.

Also, I think this suffered from the same poison as MoM: unrealistic expectations (which Marvel was partially responsible for) and the desire for another End Game experience. Be patient, fellow nerds: the payoff is coming!!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Complicated plot, so recommend watching online summaries of prior movies first.  Funny and action filled at the same time.  See it in 4dx if you can - immersive and engaging!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The dialogue was pretty bad in moments but overall I thought it was a really fun new addition to the MCU.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Where do I start, it was funny, I'll give it that I laughed a couple times and I had fun with it. But why it's so low of a review is because the plot lacks. They have to make the villain weak for plot progression which would make NO SENSE if it was irl, but im not going ti rent about it.
 This really felt like Starwars in so many different ways, from the aliens and the spaceships to even some of the scenes like the rebellion bit at the end with them all charging at Kang. Im praying that guardians 3 will be a step back into the right direction for marvel. 

5/10"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the film. I don't know why it's being reviewed so poorly. The humour that is common in the series was still there and I found the story and reveals fascinating. It kept me engaged the whole time. 
 I liked the world building of the quantum realm and the visuals that came with it. I may upset some peeps here but there where times the movie gave me ""Big trouble in little Chinatown"" vibes.  I guess it was from the characters discovering a whole new, crazy, wacked out world with unbelievable characters beneath their own. 
 I did wonder if Bill Murray's role was reduced or not. It's pretty brief but really fun. I'll have to wait for click bait articles to find out I spose.
 I can't believe I'm saying these because I find tomato scores very accurate and reliable but not this time. Don't let the score turn u off of catching this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Rotten Tomatoes Company of Critics are not right nor could they truly understand storytelling if the Critic gave a Rotten Tomato.
'Quantumania' has a group of people trying to remove themselves from a nemesis trying to recruit them but they cannot give anything to him other than some blows to prevent Ant-Mans and The Wasps family to fall. 
I gave this Film the Highest Review for lack of boredom and the entertaining and real and good conflicts."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie me and my family truly enjoyed it. Lot's of action.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved every second of it!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Its ok.The first half hour was great, very funny and full of fantastic Jack Kirby goodness and then it went to the usual Marvel by numbers movie. Not the worst MCU film by any means, but god dammit please just do something new already, these are very predictable now. Say what you will about DC movies but at least they're not this predictable."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Johnathan is the best!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I like it better than Love and Thunder. Kahn carried the whole film!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie!!! I enjoy it‚Ä¶ Please do not listen to all the negative comments! If you a movie fan and love marvel movie, Go See if for yourself."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,great action/ comedic relief for an Ant-Man movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,From the beginning to the end it was fabulous. A must see indeed!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As if it couldn't get any worse than Thor Love and Thunder - it does. It's laughably bad. You can have a good time with this movie but the amount of plot holes, terrible CGI and head-scratching moments will leave you questioning the MCU's direction.
The script seems lazy and the writing for it was underwhelming. The Star Wars comparisons are somewhat enjoyable especially the big action fights but the jokes, wasted characters and ESPECIALLY the storytelling felt more of a bad joke.
Jonathan Majors as Kang stood out as the overall performance no doubt about it. His empire-building almost Darth Vader-ish characterization of Kang The Conqueror really made his portrayal unique. Really wish he got more screen time to develop it further.
For Paul Rudd and the rest of the actors/actresses? Very immobile to say the least. Adding nothing but silliness to their character and the story overall. 
But to give some credit, Majors excelled as Kang and the short action fights are somewhat engaging. But as they say it's not a one man show and Majors can't be doing all the work here. The other actors just look like they didn't want to be there."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a comic book movie and it's perfect for that. Love it! Can't wait to see it again.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Yes.yes.yes. yes. Mind-blowingly awesometacular. Stay for end credits. Yes.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was one of the most creative worlds I have ever seen.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a great movie despite what Rotten Tomatoes rated it. If you love Marvel movies, you will love this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have no idea why some of these rating are so down. This was FUN!!!! And Jonathan Majors is amazing. It's what I would consider a filler / exposition of the next phase of marvel movies. A narrative bridge. But, it was a really fun bridge to cross. My only gripe is that I can not stand the actress playing Cassie, and she came across as incredibly fake and one dimensional. Outside of that, I had a good time with this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun enough.  Few laughs.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a REALLY good movie ‚Ä¶ full of great action¬†¬ªJonathan Major is just amazing and it a good star for marvel next phase
Dont ever forget that you have to treat those movie like a comic book that link with others (with that in mind this was SUPER GOOD )"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't know what the critics are talking about at all but the movie was pretty good. Kang was a big standout and I can't wait to see more of him. The relationship dynamic between Scott and Cassie was really good as well. Stick around for 2 post credits!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are wrong. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a good movie. It fits right in with the current overall story of the MCU, it gives back story on characters we have seen before. Fills in gaps and creates a new threat going forward. Critics are so wrong about this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's best to see a movie for yourself this movie was pretty good, yes it had some issues but overall a great Quantum ride."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed the movie! I‚Äôll probably rewatch it because a lot of it was fun! There are some flaws, which were pretty obvious and the reason for others‚Äô poor reviews. It just throws you into craziness with little explanation, and when you get there you‚Äôre reminded of Star Wars a little too much to not think it‚Äôs a blatant rip off of some major elements. Janet has experience and knowledge in this part of the movie that is contrived and kinda takes you out of it. However, if you set that aside, most of the rest is very enjoyable and wacky fun. The major villains of the movie make the same mistakes movie bad guys make, and there is a populace of warriors whose presence is unexplained and unearned. Still, it was fun and laugh out loud funny at times. The cast was excellent at what they were trying to do. I‚Äôd say the reviews trashing it are over selling the problems. Check it out if you enjoyed either of the first two Ant-Man movies and / or Thor 3 or 4. It‚Äôs that level of comedy."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Solid Marvel film that, while not extraordinary, makes for another fun time at the movies.  The cast is excellent across the board, with Paul Rudd his usual charming self as Ant-Man/Scott Lang while Kathryn Newton is equally appealing as his daughter, Cassie.  The standouts, though, is Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne, who shows she is still a capable Wasp, while Jonathan Majors makes an instant impression as Kang, setting him up as the next major villain of the Marvel universe.  Behind the camera, director Peyton Reed delivers a solid film with some fun action, but doesn't quite take full advantage of the Quantum Universe's possibilities.  Plus, MODOK, while played for laughs, is mostly laughed at instead of with.  Overall, still a fun movie experience, thanks to the talented actors."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Forget the ""professional"" critics! This movie is the best Marvel movie made after the last Spider Man and it really sets up future conflicts with Kang who is a beast. It's going to take every remaining Avenger ""old and new"" to take him down. Please stay for the mid and post credits."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun and silly movie. Good laughs.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"boring, typical marvel movie, more attempts at jokes than any narrative substance"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,great fun action flick! can't believe wait to see how this ties up w the rest of the mcu
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I think critics must be getting paid off to say all new marvel sucks just because marvel and Disney have become such a monopoly. Movie was dope. Kang is a beast! Can not wait for more!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I never trust Rotten tomatoes critic score completely and I am glad I do that. The 3rd installment was a very good movie. Strong introduction to Kang. All actors/actresses did their roles to their best. Good CGI too. My only complaint is what the f they did to MODOK. He is a big deal in comics as far as I know but in the end they made him a kinda good guy and eventually killed him off. Hope he will introduced again via playing Multiverse card. I will say a good start to Phase 5.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are being way too harsh. Good movie üëç
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie overall. Not sure why it wasn‚Äôt liked by some critics. Definitely better than Thor. Perhaps not based on the comics exactly but entertaining
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie it definitely has a Star Wars feel
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining and fantastic.
Special effects and CGI perfect. 
Opens the next phase of the MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ignore the critics.  No Oscar performances, perhaps, but this movie was definitely entertaining, visually incredible and imaginative, and Majors is an awesome villain.  If you are an MCU fan, go see it!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hilarious & fun.  Kang is a new serious threat, but was nice to see an enjoyable MCU movie, vs. a chore."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pretty boring, should have waited to steam it. Disappointing"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly one of my favorite Ant Man movies. It had its fair share of regular Scott Lang humor and then it's serious moments. A lot of people are shitting on this movie because Kang lost, but that doesn't mean the movie sucks. It was an Ant Man movie which is why it was funny the humor wasn't forced like multiple people said. If you hate this movie I don't trust you."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great balance of comedy and serious acting
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good end to the trilogy. Questions galore going forward. Armies will need to mobilize and lives will be lost. Kang is coming.....
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Decent plot, suffers from being too jokey/goofy. Majors is head and shoulders above the rest of the acting, but one of the ways he is beaten at the end is particularly poor."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,why are the critics so hard on this? definitely my favorite of the trilogy!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,that was incredible I love this movie because Ant-Man is a good movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really loved this movie! The dialogue was very well written, especially the father daughter parts, something that i feel is often lacking in marvel films. Seeing the quantum realm reminded me of the first time i saw star wars. I recommend seeing it in Imax with laser or as  I saw it in Dolby Cinema. This will help show off all the colors in the quantum realm scenes."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun and creative way to explore the quantum realm, one of the best Marvel movies in the last 2 years, honestly I don't know why critics are complaining about.

I guess the biggest Marvel villain is actually the hate wave that they have been facing, everything they produce has been destroyed by critics."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was so crazy in the best way! I think people are showing a major primacy bias when it comes to the MCU, critics and fans set their expectation of every movie to an End Game level and won't let the movies be what they are. This was a wild movie that I suspect will be a cult classic. Stoners in dorm rooms will be enjoying this film for decades to come."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun movie! Lots of genuine funny moments!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a very well made movie. I'm a big antman fan anyways. The plot was good. Action and humor. Marvel not much good go wrong.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining and a great start to the next phase of marvel. Kind of predictable but in an original way. Enjoyed more than any phase four movie except Shang Chi and no way home
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not like other MCU films. I understand the hate but you‚Äôll have to process it differently from the other films. That being said, it was a bumpy but solid start to the new phase."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I have always liked Ant-Man
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I felt that the rate of 48% does not reflect how good the movie was. Yes several jokes were stale, but overall, it did feel exciting where it counted. The only movie that was rated spot on was Eternals, and Ant Man shouldn't be in the same league with that trash of a movie....but Salma, I LOVE YOU!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! I will be going again but in 3d
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Love everything from start to finish
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,")
This was lazy and messy. Majors was amazing and the Quantum realm also looks beautiful, but everything else was just bad. The other actors were phoning it, the new characters were just completely forgettable and the MODOK CGI was laughable (some seen in the trailers; people in the cinema laughed AT it, not with the jokes about it.
It was wholly forgettable."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning awesome mindbendyness, great world building"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid movie of the quality we've come to expect from Marvel. The movie explores a part of the MCU we've dealt with a lot now but never truly explored. Michelle Pfeifer as Janet Van Dyne and Jonathan Majors as Kang give standout performances. It's a great start to Marvel's Phase Five.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a mess‚Ä¶ I'm really sorry to see such a handful of wrong script decision just to make the movie lighter. Where is that MCU of past days, who had the courage to show something like Infinity Wars? Shame on you, Kevin Feige."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film! Cant wait for more!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,What a great movie. There was so much action. Critics said there wasn't much action and there was a TON of action. Best Ant-Man movie yet.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,OMG : Loved the movie it's a true ant man and the wasp marvel movie : Johnathan Majors was awesome: this movie was GREAT !
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good action  funny at times great special effects good plot line . Well worth with watching  a bit pricey for IMAX  best seen in standard  version
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel is loosing its ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor. This is an average addition to the marvel family. Ok if you got nothing else to do. Probably just as good to wait it out to watch on Disney +
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the creatures and visuals. More sci-fi based, I'm not sure what haters were expecting from the Quantum Realm but it didn't let me down! Jonathan Majors is great as Kang and I cant wait to see more from him in the future!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know what they are talking about with lacking adventure. An excellent movie especially given that we were already familiar with the villian. Great movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is far from the worst MCU movie, but it's also far from the best. The first half of the film has too much going on, as it switches back and forth between plotlines. The film also feels like it loses the charm of the first two Ant-Man movies. They do a good job at building the world of the Quantum Realm. The cast is great with Paul Rudd being as likeable as ever a Ant-Man and Jonathon Majors conquering as Kang, who is a top-tier MCU villain. The action is great and the humor lands for the most part, making this a really fun, but slightly disappointing time. But the fact that Luis isn't in it with his very own suit, is devastating!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Un buon film, sicuramente non il migliore dell'mcu ma fa il suo dovere"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good and funny
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie and honestly don‚Äôt understand why critics rated it so low. Lots of action, good story and awesome way of introducing Kang to the movie world."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Really fun movie. Kang is the stand out. Brilliant performances from Paul Rudd and Michelle Pfeiffer. Looking forward to what's to come from Jonathan Majors.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really good if you are a marvel person. More action than before. 
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it, Kang is definitely ruthless."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film was a lot of fun and my kids and I enjoyed it. Kang was terrifying and I can't wait to see him more in the MCU. Humor was on par with previous Ant-Man films but when Kang was there, the seriousness was clear."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Generic factory movie; nothing new to watch and a complete copy of other franchises like Starwars; Bad performances by the cast. The script and CGI are just bad.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a very cool and really fun Marvel live-action movie sequel. It had really astonishing special effects, really wonderful cinematography, really superb cast, really phenomenal characters, really awesome action, very great comedy, really nice drama, really amazing music, really marvelous visuals, really well done costumes and a very interesting plot. I really would prefer the first two ‚ÄúAnt-Man‚Äù movies than this one. I definitely recommend this movie to Marvel fans of all ages."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman Quantumania is a slight step down from the previous movies, it's is nevertheless the a great movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"No entiendo las cr√≠ticas. Es de las pel√≠culas que m√°s me han gustado del UCM. Y Kang me parece incre√≠ble, ojal√° ver mucho m√°s de √©l antes de la Dinast√≠a de Kang"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such an awesome film! Loved watching every second of it, and I love how this sets up the future of the MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Smooth film that managed to entertain me, without boring me from start to finish, good CGI and still fun. It's not the best movie of the MCU but personally I liked it a lot!
It reminded me of films such as a journey to the center of the earth, in a certain sense, emotions that I loved as a child and still love today. I recommend watching the film to everyone and I hope that people who haven't seen it yet will bring out a little of their own personality and personal criticism, without dwelling on the negative criticisms of others. Basically this film deserves to be seen, then obviously you can like it or not!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved how Ant Man finally got his due! Great explanation of multiverse and introduction of Kang! Love love love
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just wait for Disney+ in a couple of months. Little to no character development, lame jokes, CGI battles. Great for normies. Quantumania is totally skippable movie. It's not even about Ant-Man, its about Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer's character) and Kang. Goofball stuff that doesn't get explained, like how ants travelled back in time and built an advanced civilization and tech, but somehow no one could figure out how to get out of the quantum realm. Pure gibberish and a nonsensical plot."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer play brilliant job of Janet Van Prye and Kang The Conqueor. But I wish they do better and little more scene in the movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang the Conqueror is better than previous marvel villains, his motives are simple , his acting is excellent. Good family story, and retains humor to enjoy it . If you are a grown adult expecting a drama film but get upset that you didn't get a snyderverse movie then you won't like it . Critics probably hate that this film revolves around a nuclear family and the dad being a hero"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It has a Star Wars meets Spy Kids kind of vibe.  
It was entertaining and family friendly."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It's become obvious that mainstream Hollywood is paying critics to troll the MCU and that people are easily influenced by their nonsense.... This is the MOST fun Marvel movie in a very long time!!! I'm sure you'll love it if you go watch it. Ignore negative reviews of this film.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining, heartfelt, and fun. Jonathan Majors is a very charismatic villain. You really feel like part of the family and there is a great setup for more to come. It was a great tip of the iceberg film."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was worried after seeing some reviews by people I respect, but as my gauge of a movie‚Äôs worth is how much my family and I relive our favorite parts and laugh, I have to give it 5 stars!  No eye-rolling moments like Thor: love and thunder."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,funny and entertaining
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty cool movie my son loved itüòè
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Contrived story line. Love the actors but the writers let the team down. Antman 3 is the third best Antman movie

Not an inspirational start to Phase 5"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was average in almost every way. Sort of disappointed. You could wait to watch it at home for sure. Jonathan Majors was great but it was a meh story.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good Story. Cool CGI visuals. Better than most phase 4 MCU films. Goto your local cinema grab some üçø and escape all the madness going on in the world at the moment for a couple hours!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Johnathan Majors is phenomenal as Kang.  The MCU heroes are in serious trouble.   Act one and two was amazing.  Act three was a mosaic of noise and the weaknesses of the film.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Like - Action, Plot, Storyline, linos to past Marvel movies with throwbacks excited to see how Ant Man's daughter matures and evolves with her suit Enjoyed learning more about the Quantum world

Dislike - Color tones throughout seems excessively dark the final scene after credits was confusing. The mid credits scene was good."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie. Like the action.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good very good like kang
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie experience was amazing, watched it on IMAX highly recommend it be watched this way, at the end of the film the entire theater was clapping. would rate this 10/10 the critics don't do it justice, I would recommend you watch it yourself rather than listen to them, this movie is for the people now critics who are tired of Marvel/super hero movies."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,it is not bad like critics say it is good and very enjoyable but don't go with high expectations go just with intention to just enjoy cuz that is what the movie wants it doesn't want to be received with a serious reaction
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Typical Marvel Movie. Majors stuns as new big bad
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie setting up phase 4 of the Marvel Universe. A few bad words but nothing the kids don‚Äôt hear now days.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Like an interstellar marvel Star Wars adventure I can see this setting us up for a whole new set of marvel adventures Entertaininggood cliff hangers. Solid film
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the characters, the humor and storyline"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it's a great movie marking the beginning of MCU's Phase 5. The movie is not a masterpiece but it is definitely an enjoyable ones. The movie carefully builds the stage for the Multiverse Saga that in-turns will lead to an epic Avengers movie - Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars. Jonathan Majors was terrifying as Kang the Conquerer. The visuals of Quantum Realm were beautiful. The movie is a pivotal one for the Multiverse Saga.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Quantumania is a fails as the start to Phase 5 and as an Ant-Man adventure. Jonathan Majors is great as Kang but the movie doesn't offer much beyond that.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It‚Äôs really good, at least I really enjoyed it. I don‚Äôt really understand the critics reviews because I thought it was a great addition to the marvel mythos. "
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cassie is overbearing in the film, Kang is the highlight of the movie and its so disappointing that they limit his power and abilities in the final act of the movie. Kang the Conquer should have been a multi film threat. He has the conviction to fight the Avengers and Council of Kangs, introduced in the post credit scene, but we will never get the chance. The lack of Antman murder in the film also disappointing. There was 2, we could do without one for the betterment of the story."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyed the new world building, enjoyed Kang, MODOK was super campy but had a few funny moments. The last act of the movie kind of lost me. Didn't stick the landing and could have been much better in building up Kang and raising the stakes of Phase 5. Because of the last 4th of the movie, it fell flat."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visually pleasing, plot meh"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the unity displayed in fighting against a tyrant. There is always strength in togetherness üëçüèøüëçüèø
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Avengers movie that was engaging from beginning to end.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Shame that only one person cared enough about this movie to do good acting job.
Marvel needs to fire all their current screenwriters and hire professionals."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun action packed movie. It wasn't your typical Ant-Man movie, as this was much larger in scale. Great introduction for Kang."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely not worth the hate it deserves. It deviates from the past movies but it should not be judged in comparison to the previous two movies. It did a decent job of setting up Kang and has a lot of things which are gonna tie-in to the future content. The story could have been executed better but still a great addition to the MCU. It has fun, action and emotion and viewers should definitely give it a watch."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a funny movie, Really recommend to anyone who hasn't seen yet!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not great. The villain is fantastic, the movie isa dud. "
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really did like this movie it was fun!! Jonathan majors was amazing!! I definitely recommend this movie. The only thing I think was wrong with the movie was the pacing issues!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,love it all caracters shine in own rigth
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed how we‚Äôre finally getting to see Kang on the big screen. Looking forward to this next phase.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I guess I'm in the minority but I loved it and thought it is by far the 2nd best movie in this phase next to spider man.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie definitely 8.5/10 not sure why the critics rated so low but the fans/audience are right. I recommend to go watch it.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good bridge to begin the next phase
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I watched this movie two days ago. I liked him. Of course, this is not mega-cool, but, in principle, a good film from which I did not expect a sparkling plot. He entertained me. And although, objectively, the film is average, for me it is better than the second part.
Kang is very cool. The actor plays well (although there are a couple of moments when, in my opinion, he is inappropriately sentimental).
The best actor in the film for me is Michael Douglas, as in the previous parts. I confess, I did not watch many films with his participation in my youth, but here he simply exceeds!
Of the minuses - a predictable plot from the 80s. There are a lot of clich√©s, which the film itself sometimes even ironically (as with MODOK, for example ... by the way, not everyone may like that here Darren aka MODOK is just a comic relief)."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I wasn't my favorite, but definitely worth a watch if your a fan fan-ANT-ic!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is pleasant and entertaining enough.  It seemed very subdued like they could have done so much more.   I wish it could have been it's own thing and not simply a device to set up Kang.  Also,  Paul Rudd is so so so pretty."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining story some really funny moments.  Sets up the fourth phase of Marvel well.  Go AntMan! #donotbeadick
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I am a fan of the sci-fi genre and the writers behind this movie. I saw this with my friend that did not enjoy this. He gave me his thoughts on it which I agree with. I just loved Kang as a threat. MODOK was ok at first, but the character ark was super flat. The different genres mixed in this movie, Strange World, Fifth Element, Dune and Star Wars were quite fascinating to pick up on. The creatures were great and Bill Murray was a treat. The actor from The Good Place was fun to see as well. 4/10 for me full review on YouTube. I did change my review from what I initially said coming out of the movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen too the credited reviewers. This film is not 48% no way near it. I'd say 70 plus at least. Some of the comments feel like they walked in just to trash it.
Great film my kids enjoyed there are other Marvel movies far worse then this."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are wrong, this is a very entertaining movie.  The only complaint, there is so much that isn't explained."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great job laying out the groundwork for Phase 5. Not your typical superhero movie but it‚Äôs not supposed to be. Kang will be back.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think it was really fun! Kang is awesome!
The critics are overthinking and too uptight. I loved the visuals and am excited to see it again."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely enjoyed the movie!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a fun popcorn movie. The stakes could have felt a little more raised, but all in all, I enjoyed it, was better than I expected. Cassie was annoying however."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, action pack, new environments, great villain, and Paul Rudd. Don't understand all the hate on this movie. Well done again Marvel Studios !! Coming from someone who has been with watching from the first Iron Man movie to all the new Disney + shows. Keep up the great work !"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It wasn't the best ant man movie but it was funny I don't like that Cassie grew up she used to be relly funny.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I mean i like it it was better that all the page 4 movies and series (except spider-man of course) but I feel like something was missing
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another great Marvel watch - and a great third Ant-Man movie! Seeing Cassie step up and become a heroine was excellent to see, along with watching Janet and Hank steal part of the movie with their faboo acting... and, of course, Hope holding the course... even when embarrassed beyond words!
The special effects are amazing, and if they don't get an Oscar for those effects, I'll be disappointed. 
A great set up to the Kang Dynasty, and a worthy sequel to the other movies. Well worth a re-watch and definitely a DVD purchase!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed this movie and I continue to enjoy the MCU. Rudd was his cool self, missed that the movie was not in SF, but the new world I enjoyed.  Kang was better then expected and Majors is a star"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very good intro to Kang!
with the usual fun of Ant Man :)"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome, best Marvel since End Game.  I don't know what these reviewers are smoking!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie. A great adventure tale with good humor that has Scott and his family trying to return from the Quantum realm. Starts to set up King as an Avengers level threat. Good times.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had a ridiculously good time watching this movie. It made me laugh, it made me cry. I never know about the star rating system. I say this because I've seen EEAAO and Banshees of Inisherin and they are both nominated for Best Picture and should be 5 star right? I don't think Ant-Man is Best Picture worthy, but I enjoyed it as much as those films. 
Specifics. The script is fantastic. Not overly complex or expository even amidst sci-fi craziness. The jokes are genuinely funny, the dialogue between characters is believable and character specific, while also illuminating the types of people they are.  I had no idea I wanted this much Hank Pym. 
Speaking of Mr. Pym, the performances by everyone were great. I loved the dynamic between Douglas and Pfeiffer and Rudd and his daughter played by Kathryn Newton. I think Evangeline Lilly's Wasp gets the short end time wise, but every contribution she made was meaningful and impactful.
The new side characters were enjoyable without overstaying welcome (looking at you Korg). But the talk will rightly be about Jonathan Majors as Kang. Great writing allowed Majors to explore different facets of this and likely will be, other variations of Kang. He was menacing at times, sympathetic at others. Many times in the movie I still didn't know if even the heroes were right or wrong about him.
The movie is slightly over 2 hours, but I personally never felt it drag and would (and likely will) watch it again.
In closing, I'm done trying to compare Marvel movies to other Marvel movies. In the end, I just want to ask myself, did I enjoy myself, and without a doubt, this movie left me with a resounding, ""YES!"""
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang the conqueror!!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie does a fantastic job of moving the MCU forward. Got to give him only half credit for accuracy in terms of the comics, but once you get past a very small inaccuracy, you have an awesome movie to kick off phase 5."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Family oriented movie. New villain introduction. Another Realm. Full action activities.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, amazing creatures and world building!! Good story that moved well. Stick around for both the mid and post credit scenes"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fairly standard Marvel fare. Entertaining enough, but not particularly memorable. Interesting villain and nice visuals (although a bit dark at times, to the point where it's difficult to see what's going on occasionally). There is one character that did take me out of it and really would be better left out. No spoilers, you'll know it when you see it. Already getting a bit bored by all the multiverse stuff though."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great pace, awesome story, and intro to Kang. It's a classic sci-fi fantasy Barbarian movie. Didn't get caught up in trying to explain all the science, they're scientists and engineers, they get it. That's all that's needed, sit back and enjoym"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie (it‚Äôs story) is eh. Overly CGI as always.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie üëåüëå
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!  We like that it was entertaining for the whole family.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"(SPOILER FREE!!!)

Yesterday, I watched Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania. And when I got out of the movie theater, I felt like, ""Wow, that has gotta be the craziest marvel movie since Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness all the way back in May 2022!"" In my opinion, I'd think it's the best movie to kick off phase 5 of the MCU. The fight scenes were good, the acting was spot on, the CGI was alright, and the action was great!
The only bad part about the movie is the boring parts. Sometimes the scenes focus way too much on Janet and Hank rather than Scott & Cassie. I just felt like, ""When will they show Scott & Cassie now?"" while Janet and Hank had too much screen time. (Even though the movie is only 2 hours and 5 minutes).
Kang the Conqueror on the other hand, he was an absolute badass. The action he was in was crazy, his personality is good, and his theme is a banger. Even though the movie has some cons, I would definitely recommend watching this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was a solid addition to the MCU while also being an entertaining film - great laughs that didn't sacrifice the plot. the movie is visually stunning while also having comic touchpoints that comic book fans will love. It's a beautiful, hilarious sci-fi family adventure with plenty of action. Ever actor has phenomenal moments but Jonathan Majors stole the show. One of the best movies in the MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Craziest thing I've ever seen, hideous storyline, foul language for no apparent reason. Might have been ok for a ten year old if it weren't for the language."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie. There were some good parts and some parts that didn‚Äôt make sense. But all in all it was pretty decent.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great!  The critics are looking for Shakespeare and don't understand the world of comics. Still, the performances by Kang, Ant Man, and Jane VanDyne were wonderful!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was so cool! I loved it, and there was humor. I cANT wait to see the next one!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great adventure movie, introducing a great villain. Kang is a good choice for the big bad of the next MCU phase. Definitely see this one in the theater, because the visual appeal of the Quantum Realm should be enjoyed on as big a screen as possible."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great. Loved the different character costumes and plot to the story.  Very colorful!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst pieces of cinema i have ever had the displeasure of seeing
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really loved it! Felt like old school Marvel
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best ant man movie yet! Better than the first two movies!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the funny part when Casey called that big head guy a sick
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was way better than the reviews I even liked modak the girl playing Cassie was never as bad as I have read why can't folks just enjoy a good fun flick instead of just trashing everything?  I put it in the middle of the mcu better than several movies including love and thunder better than most of phase four in my opinion go watch it be open minded enjoy it
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really good compared to what the reviews were saying. Glad I went to watch.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Potentially interesting storyline ruined by lazy screenwriting
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,what can i say after thor and black adam i didnt had any expectations for another comic book movie but this was pretty decent in comparison . humor actually delivered and it wasnt everywhere plus it wasnt cringe)
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've never disagreed more with critic reviews than with Ant-Man 3. I guess comic book movies aren't in style anymore ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. If you're an MCU fan and not expecting some Shakespearian drama, you'll probably enjoy it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really good critics got it wrong very enjoyable.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a great movie and doesn't deserve the hate.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Big on action and suspense!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Far, far better than what the initial scores would have you believe. Rudd remains a live threat to be the face of the Avengers going forward and the entire ""Ant-Fam"" are superb, I hope we aren't done with them. Majors‚Ä¶ Kang‚Ä¶ Majors‚Ä¶ Kang‚Ä¶ 10/10. Can't wait to see him expanded upon even more. The MCU takes a giant innovative and successful step!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was the best part of the film! I can‚Äôt wait to see what they do with his character in the future films. Jonathan majors killed it!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was amazing ! Reading these reviews were shocking to me because I just watched it and I thought it was one of the best marvel films . Some of the humour seems forced but everything else was amazing ! I am giving it a 5 star rating because the graphics , the CGI and the finale were all awesome and nothing more could been done to make them all even better !"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Idk why it's getting so much hate it's far from perfect but the reviews made it sound like it was a complete waste of time the scenes after the credits was worth the price of admission alone and I was entertained for 2 hours again far from perfect and i don't see it winning any awards or anything like that but if you're like me and thought it was gonna be shitty cause of the ratings always go with the audience score cause it's got a 49 percent rating lol when it should be like 70 I also took some edibles maybe that helped hahaha hope this helps someone on the ropes about seeing it if your a fan of marvel movies you gonna enjoy it for the most part
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie. Every part of it, not sure what people disliked about it. Love Paul Rudd, enjoyed the actress playing his daughter, she was cute. My 7 year old watched it with my husband and I. We all enjoyed it."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"WOW! Phase 5 is out of the gates with a bang, except Kevin Feige forgot to throw the firecracker. Since when did a convenient plot device become the norm for ""writers"" to bail themselves out? And what movies have they seen where inner monologuing works? And who are all of these characters that were supposed to care about? There are more bailouts in this movie than during the Wall Street crash in 2008 and that is exactly the path CEO Bob Chapek is headed. The few times I did laugh wasn't because I was tickled by something that was written or delivered cleverly, but out of embarrassment for the catastrophe of what has become the M She U franchise. Disney has turned Marvel into a unreliable boiler that has to be reset everyday or she'll blow up. I wanted to like this movie so much and spend the weekend maybe going again. But - I'll pass and stay at home and play Hogwarts Legacy. Thanks for nothing Marvel."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Acting by two actors in the first act of the film was really poor. On the other hand, Jonathan Majors acted amazingly. I was also really impressed by the special effects. And there never was a dull moment. I also applaud the creativity and imagination.
This is certainly in the top realm of the best 3.5/5 films I've seen."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"(Spoiler Free review) Great start to phase 5 and a comeback to Marvel. Quantumania has balanced humor, and establishes its antagonist as one of the most intimidating villains in movie history."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Not at all as bad as the critics are saying. The movie is fun and Kang is incredible. Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer stole the show. Truly sets up the next phase of the MCU
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Muito bom!!!! cumpre o que promete e diverte bastante.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Jonathan Majors did a great job feeling like a real oncomming threat and movie overall was great. Introduction into the quantum realm seemed to go too quickly and might have been better spread out among various films but overall excited for whats in store.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is fun and sets up nicely the rest of the phase about to come. It‚Äôs no Endgame like everyone wants, but Majors puts on a helluva performance."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Enjoyable but clearly for those who know Marvel. Serves as a good prelude to other projects
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantamania is a great action-comedy -- not a heart wrencher like Wakanda Forever. It also does a fantastic job of setting up the next phase of films with a menacing performance by Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror and hilarious take on M.O.D.O.K.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a fun Marvel movie that sets up the next phase nicely.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A good marvel movie , the haters just want to see art films and doesn't know anything about comics. The only bad was the stupid socialism scrip."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Final fight scene, all of it"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"it was a good family movie but not a good action movie, especially for an Avenger! They could've put in more effort."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang's movie. He stole the show.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Really enjoyed the first Ant-Man movie, which was a welcome surprise to me at the time.  This film however was a real letdown.  Slow pace, jokes that just weren't funny, actors/actresses making the best of weak writing.  You could see that they were trying, and some did really good, but the acting can only take poor writing so far.  Also didn't feel like there was anything at stake.  When it comes to special effects, I'm okay with mediocre stuff so long as it's good enough to move the plot, but in this case the CGI was so bad it was a distraction-- and this comes from someone who LOVES the original StarTrek TV show, which had really goofy sets (but those didn't get in the way of the film).  Overall, I give the actors an 'A' for effort, and Marvel an 'F'... well okay, how about an 'incomplete' instead."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved this movie! It really kick started phase 5, and it was hilarious! I will definitely see it again!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ignore the critics, only valid criticism is that cassie needed better writing and some cgi problems"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Ich habe mich durchwegs unterhalten gef√ºhlt.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm really confused where the hate for this movie is coming from. It wasn't perfect but definitely doesn't deserve a 48%. This Kang wasn't mean to be the most powerful one and it's a setup for what's to come.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than expected. Overall, I enjoyed Ant Man Quantumania. But  Modok's face though. That was hilariousü§£"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the continuity and how Cassie is become a hero in her own right
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Typical story and ending.  It was a money grab and they took mine, I‚Äôm very much a fan of the avengers but this has gone to far for me ! Yes me, but you may like it ?"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was very happy to spend majority of the movie in the quantum realm, the movie was very exiting and the humour was light years better than Thor love and thunder. This whole movie has me hyped for avengers the kang dynasty even more than I already was."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the third installment in the ""Ant-Man"" series, following ""Ant-Man"" (2015) and ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" (2018). It is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics characters Scott Lang / Ant-Man and Hope van Dyne / Wasp. The movie is directed by Peyton Reed and stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp, Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,very good movie!! i really enjoyed it!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I honestly enjoyed it a lot.  Don't know what the critics are thinking.  Liked it more than black panther 2 and thor 3.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly don't know what the critics score represents. If you're an MCU fan, it's the best thing since No Way Home and Endgame. Great, massive introduction to Kang! You definitely need the background of Antman 2, Endgame and Loki, but if you've been keeping up you'll be super excited to leap into the next phase."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of fun! This movie is funny when it's supposed to be. Great action, good story, a few plot holes or minor annoyances don't take away from the experience. CGI for one villain was a little shocking, but it grew on me. I look forward to seeing it again!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,It just felt very disappointing and a big let down
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was alot of fun. Kang is certainly going to be a problem.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was really good! Lots of laughs, good story, very solid performances. Even though it's kicking off Phase V, works as a standalone film. Anyone review bombing this is only doing so because these movies are mainstream now, and it's cool to bash on mainstream things."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was a ton of fun and went right along cohesively with the direction the MCU has been heading since Avengers: Endgame. I don't really understand the critique of ""only for fans of the MCU"" considering it is the 3rd film in a trilogy, so I would assume the majority of people viewing are returning fans with a solid grasp of what to expect. So in conclusion, if you LOVE the MCU, you're gonna enjoy this movie. If you don't, well then I don't really understand why you'd be going in the first place. üòä"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a solid and fun Marvel movie.  Wish there had been more humor in this one.  Disappointed Michael Pe√±a‚Äôs character Luis didn‚Äôt show up.  Can‚Äôt wait to see more Kang!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lots of action but too much foul language
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movies that take place in alternate dimensions can become too abstract but this movie stays well within the possibility of a place that could exist. The quantum verse has a touch of Starwars charm and real world consequence that keeps the film semi grounded. The movie was fun but not necessarily a masterpiece. Very much a comic book in movie form. Not a movie to be taken too seriously. It is lighthearted popcorn film and I would recommend marvel fans to watch the Loki show before attempting to see it. Otherwise the storyline might be a little confusing.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The first installment in the Ant Man trilogy remains one of my favourite editions to the MCU, for the characters, cast, and the heartfelt feeling that you get from watching it. The second film was underwhelming, busy in the worst way, and had charcter motivations that remained simple and unperturbed throughout the course of the movie. This third film is much like the second. A final underwhelming flash in the pan for a director that probably should have been exiled to the quantum realm after the last film. If you don't love Marvel, wait for this one on Disney+"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie did many things right and many things wrong. Solid opener to phase five. Also they wasted M.O.D.O.K. (in my opinion at least)
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very refreshing and different from the other films make sure to stay for. The very end credit as it implies a very key feature into the next Marvel series.

I think the film could've had a bit more adventure love the little blob thing I think hope  Could've done with a lot more screen time considering it's Antman and the wasp I love how they introduced Kang Marvel seem to be killing a big characters as villains off easily in every film and kang had to much power so quickly but I think to prove how bad he is someone should of died that way key to the film. But overall it's a definitely must say but you have to watch most Marvel films to understand but as I said I feel like Marvel are killing big villains from the comics off to easily overall like Ultron and Modok thanos is storyline was continuous and led up to endgame I feel like that will be similar with Kang but a lot of villains have been killed off within the first hour of after being introduced. But overall I'd write the film a 7. 5 out of 10 also just because Paul Rudd is it is a must see."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a blast and I really enjoyed the way the showcase Kang as a threat. They throw everything they have at him including super ants and even though they won the battle, the real war is coming. Minus points for Cassie being terrible but other than that great all around!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Modok is the worst VFX I have ever seen in a professional film. Disney is so cheap and it shows in the overall product. They look like low budget TV shows. Shooting in front of a greenscreen or in the 10ft square space of the Volume, giving them no room to move around. Try building a set for once Disney"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!! Must watch!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I needed a good Marvel flick after some disappointing ones. Definitely a crazy fun adventure into the quantum/multiverse. Can't wait to see what happens next!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Forget the haters, this one is a lot of fun. Had a blast!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was slow at the beginning and then picked up. If flet like the movie was two thirds storyline and one third action.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it from begging end it finally gave us answers we've been wanting to know and to me it is highly entertaining don't believe the critics watch with your own eyes and enjoy that's all I have to say I give it a 10 out of 10 A++
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very boring movie due to extreme lack of stakes. Main plot line felt contrived 
and every major plot point goes in the main characters favor, never making it seem like anything bad will happen to them. The entire motive was too impersonal to have any impact. The movie besides the end credit scene felt unimportant and I am fairly certain that a bare bone summary of this movie would suffice to understand the upcoming marvel movies."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ignore the ""official"" critics. Because they are ridiculous. This movie is awesome. Great story. Great addition to the Marvel timeline! Paul Rudd is amazing as always,  as is the rest of the cast. Can't wait to see where the universe takes us next. Go see it. Must see."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"More funny and family oriented than expected.  A little less action than what we are used to, but overall a very enjoyable film."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the stronger MCU entries post Endgame.  Much more at stake here than the first two Ant-man movies and Jonathan Majors was great as Kang.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well conceived, although the multiverse is getting convoluted. Hopefully, this will be resolved with the next series of films. The audience with me was supportive of the film."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very intense vfx at times, but what are you to expect from the quantum realm. I really enjoyed the movie, very excited for what's next."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The 4dx further enhanced the movie experience for me which I really enjoyed
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was perfect, it did not lack fun scenes, to be fair it had balanced fun/action/storytelling scenes, angry Ant Man was quite a shockingly great surprise, and despite the obvious fact of in-bred ants getting sucked to Quantum Realm kinda gave part of the movie away, it was something everybody expected and wanted to see."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a fun and natural continuation of everything the first two Ant-Man movies have built as their particular flavor of Marvel movies.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant Man Quantumania does star wars better than the modern trilogy did. This movie feels like a rollercoaster from the very beginning. It's easy to look past the strange plotholes as we adventure through a world that doesn't really adhere to any specific rules. It's exciting to see the MCU expand in several different directions at once, and with a genuinely frightening villain looming."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Balanced pace and laughs. Standout performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think people are hating on marvel movies this was a good movie fun times
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW: I felt a bit of dread going into this because of the critic scores but they were so far wide of the mark and I really enjoyed it. Let's be honest, the film isn't without its faults, and I personally really disliked the two bookend scenes with the voiceovers, but the story is solid, the visuals are stunning and the characters have depth and evolution. Michelle Pfeiffer and Johnathan Majors really excel and carry the bulk of the story, and Evangeline Lilly is great as Hope, but I wish she didn't feel so secondary in these movies. The film is VERY cgi heavy, and that won't be for everyone, because it pivots massively from the tone and feel of the first two instalments, but it's done well and at times strikingly beautiful (I watched in IMAX). The film does a great job of introducing Kang and making him feel threatening, making it one of the few Marvel movies where there's a sense that the good guys might not win the day, which I appreciated. There's some bits of Janet's backstory that we're told about throughout the film that I'd have loved them to delve into a little more, perhaps with some flashbacks, rather than just telling us, but it's a minor quibble in an otherwise solid entry. This film has definitely divided the critics, but it's really worth watching it playing out on the big screen and making your own mind up, because it has a lot to offer and is a great entry into the wider MCU. Definite recommend. 4.5/5"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Classic Marvel. Loved it.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"En lo personal la pel√≠cula me gust√≥ bastante pero si le falta una mejor historia, esa chispa donde el p√∫blico llega a gritar o a emocionarse. 
Cosas que me gustaron demasiado fue la interpretaci√≥n de Jonathan Majors como Kang, fue una introducci√≥n muy buena del villano. 
Por parte de M.O.D.O.K tengo que decir que no fue mucho de mi agrado, si bien la apariencia rob√≥tica es muy buena, al quit√°rsela es desagradable verlo as√≠ y no lo digo porque el personaje no sea feo sino que su adaptaci√≥n no lo es.  

Las escenas post-cr√©ditos nos dejan ver lo que se viene en el futuro con la nueva dinast√≠a y con la segunda temporada de Loki, son muy satisfactorias y, a diferencia de la pel√≠cula, en ellas si se provoca la emoci√≥n y entusiasmo por querer ver m√°s."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Extremely boring and slow!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the third installment of the Ant-Man trilogy was a spectacular thrill and really wasn't messing around this time. Although the previous two installments were on the light-hearted side, Ant-Man 3 kicked it into high gear introducing the Multiversal threat known as Kang the Conqueror. The end of the film really made me wonder the MCU will present to us moving and how it connects to the future Avengers: Kang Dynasty film."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining and compact. Not such a downer as Black Panther 2, not such an insult like the last Thor."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very solid MARVEL movie. Sets up the future of the MCU beautifully and gives fans some clarity into the future of the MCU which many have been asking for. Kang is set up to perfection and there is just enough of him to make you want more in future MCU projects. Jonathon Majors' performance is elegant and extravagant as Kang, he clearly knows what he is doing and I can't wait to see his character fight other Avengers. Only complaint is that I would've liked to see him conquer a little more but I am sure there will be more of that in the near future. MODOK was great comedic relief and I personally enjoyed the direction they took with him, although I expect many hard core MODOK fans to be disappointed. CGI was also really good and the quantum realm is very cool looking. Overall great movie, keep it up. Can't wait for Kang Dynasty."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Quantum Realm was totally cool, like traveling in another dimension, the fight and hand to hand battle was great and love how Cassie throw a big punch."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"While Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a colorful, humorous addition to the MCU, its unfocused story lets it down on repeat viewings. The visual effects look good, but ultimately they're used too much, crowding out the main characters and leading to many battle scenes that just devolve into a mess of meaningless colors. The setting of the Quantum Realm takes away much of the charm of the Ant-Man franchise, trading in the low-key, grounded setting, for an expansive CGI world. This does, however, allow for the introduction of Kang the Conqueror. Jonathan Major's recent issues aside, he absolutely rocks as Kang, delivering an incredible, terrifying performance that leaves you eagerly anticipating his next appearance."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A solid weekend watch that never felt like it could find its tone. Sometimes it was comedic and others were very serious. A few plot holes that left it dry, but the villain is what really made it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A wacky, fun trip into an unexplored area of the MCU. Paul Rudd is fantastic as always, with magnificent supporting performances from Jonathan Majors, Kathryn Newton, and Michelle Pfeiffer specifically. The story isn't anything groundbreaking, but this is one of the most fun movies I've seen in a while. Leans into the bizarre and ridiculous aspects in a way that makes the movie very endearing."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A good end to the Ant-Man Trilogy &  great start to something new!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A small story with a Huge Vilain introduction.
It felt a bit like an amusement ride. Hey look at this! Hey look at that!
M.O.D.O.K was done above what I espected him to be. I hope we see him again.
Kang is fine. Still not scary enough for me (tbh he wasn't in the comics for me either) the veteran actors did what needed to be done (Murray, Doaglas and Pheifer) and that was fine too.
Wasp could've have more screen time.
Where is Louis?! *sad face*
Agent Cho friendship is awesome!
Kinda missed the Father Daughter chemistry.
Cassie's actor tried too much I feel like.
All in all a very wholesome movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,The general idea is really great but the execution lacks in some parts.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved this movie probably gonna be my favorite of the AntMan films. Not as funny as I hoped but great MCU entry, I would call this the GoTG of the Multiverse Saga, we meet the big bad (Kang) we get some information on the Quantum Realms' place within the MCU which is awesome and we get some major chess pieces moving on the table."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's just a dump, pointless and meaningless movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Just don't take Modok too seriously.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"First of all the title is a lie. The wasp is barely present in this movie. The greensceen is visible all the time and it has no impact for antman, Also it doesnt't specify the motiviton for Kang. Only very vague ( you havent seen what i have seen). Yes i havent because nobody showed me. Just a trick to persue you to watch the future films. The perfomance of Kang was okay, The other parts were just bullshit. Antmans daughter is out of nowhere able to build a device to travel into  Quantumania? Michelle Pfeiffer knew of Kang but didnt tell anyone until 2/3 of the movie is done? For sure. Hope this universe dies."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,So cringe and trying to push weird narratives
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a Marvel movie so, of course, it's amazing. I definitely want to watch it again! Love Paul Rudd and what he brings to this character!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very childish felt like the dialogue was written by 8 year olds that being said the visuals of the quantum realm was amazing kang and Janet saved the day
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fine. About as good as Antman No. 2.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan majors killed his role !!! Honestly stole the show. Disappointed of how they treated the character after pitching him as a thanos level threat. But excited bout the future of his character
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great though it was a little different than the previous ones it worked for me . Exploring the quantum realm more would have been great.  But ever since kang enter the scene things change and the movie turn out to be worth it's hype . And the 2 post credit scenes will have wanting more. So If you know marvels multiverse saga go and watch the film
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a good movie but sometimes ok
story 6/10
live action style 7/10
characters 8/10
overall 7/10 good."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A wonderful and wild ride!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Forget the haters.  If you truly enjoy Marvel films then this another great one.  Quantimania continues the saga of the Ant family, but also feels different than the previous Marvel films. Make mine Marvel!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the movie. the post credit scenes are fire.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Really not great. While I don't think it's an atrocious movie, it's one of those movies I would turn off and go do sometng else if i didn't watch it in the cinema."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There‚Äôs no way, people actually enjoyed this movie as a movie buff I try to let any genre have a chance and I love action marvel type movies but this was sooooooo boring, uneventful and over all just too fantastical the story is confusing no one knows what‚Äôs going on and everyone was asleep and gasped for a sigh of relief when the credits rolled"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Damn fine film! Made me laugh throughout!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are so disconnected from the fan base when reviewing these movies.  This movie was amazing.

It has just enough star wars type fantasy with amazing visuals but not so much that it takes away from the main story.  And KANG IS A BEAST!  I see why so many people give Kang so much respect, like Holy Bajeebus I look forward to how the Avengers will have to Overcome this threat."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfect start for Marvrel phase 5
In the movie kang ü§Øü§Øü§©ü§©"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lack of fun loving humor we have seen before. 
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good, fun movie! But I did miss the X-Con crew not being in it."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I love Paul Rudd. Michael Douglas was spectacular when he walked in with the ants! I am not too fond of Cassie and her ""we must help them"" at all costs attitude. I don't think they needed to add her to the cast with the suit and how did Michael & Michelle become her grandparents? The movie was a bit of a disappointment although I enjoyed the various characters. Not enough originality, too much like Star Wars Cantina."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't understand what all the hate was for? It's an Antman movie that's supposed to be enjoyable and solidify KANG as the next filian (which it did). Did endgame and NWH set the bar too high for these critics? I'm genuinely curious.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thrilling, exciting, and, at times, chilling! While not the best MCU movie, it is for sure the best Ant Man movie! I could not recommend this movie more!!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is the first MCU movie that I've fallen asleep on. The writing and plot was awful. Almost like the movie was AI generated. There are a few things that I did like, such as Kang. Also, MODOK was cool to see on screen. Would love to see more of both of these characters in the future, hopefully under better writing and scripts."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it! I was a great intro to phase 5! Jonathan Majors is a phenomenal actor! He gave so many layers to Kang. I knew he was going to be the villain from the beginning but I still wanted to trust him. I went in with reservations because I wanted Cassie to look differently just based on the previous Cassie but Kathryn Newton did a great job turning that around. Overall it was an amazing movie and I'm also glad I watched the mini-series on Disney plus because it gave a lot of insight as well.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Aweful dialogue but incredible special effects, and the actor who plays the villain did an amazing job.
Dopey but entertaining."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great start to Phase 5. Quantumania expands on the multiverse while also going back to the tried and trusted Marvel Movie formula we have been missing.

The ""Quantum Realm"" has a very obvious Star Warsy feel, and I am here for that. The camera work made the time spent in the ""Quantum Realm"" feel distinct from the time in the ""Real"" universe.

Jonathan Majors delivers a powerful performance as Kang, which is only improved by his chemistry with the other actors, especially Michelle Pfeiffer.

Overall a great Marvel movie, even though it lacked some real stakes. But then again, it is an Ant-man movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It can be good but it gives you entertainment and post and credit and mid credit scene steals the show also marvel has great job for introducing ka ng in this movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good and entertaining movie. It fell a bit short of my expectations (the marvel nerd in me) but if you look at this movie objectively, it was well done. Not sure why they are going the direction they are for Kang but I'm curious to see it unfold. Worth the watch!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I WAS EXPECTING MORE FROM KANG  TIME POWERS,PAST STORY LINE,AND HE GOT DEFEATED BY ANTMAN WAS SAD AND VFX WAS LITTLE INCONSISTENT BUT I FORGOT IT IS AN ANTMAN MOVIE NOT A KANG MOVIE ,SO ITS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT , BUT POST CREDIT SC....WAS GOAT."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another solid Marvel movie. Had a couple eye rolling moments, but overall a good movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Go out and see it for yourself. The critics rating this movie rotten are the same ones that praised Thor: Love and Thunder, which was a TERRIBLE movie. This movie isn't the best marvel has to offer, but if you like the Ant-Man franchise, you're in for a treat as this is the best out of the three. Paul Rudd always delivers, Jonathan Majors steals the show, Evangeline Lilly's character was wasted and little screen time. Really enjoyed it, overall I'd give it a 4/5. Good start to phase 5 compared to the lackluster phase 4."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Ant-Man movie is basically a action adventure film which follows the path of movies like Wizard of Oz, Tron, and even the original Star Wars. That makes it a very different movie from the original Ant-man and it's sequel. The humor of Ant-man is there but it's much more subdued once the characters enter the Quantum Realm. 

A lot of the humor of Ant-man was the way he interacted with our world and how he and Hope could and use their powers to make everyday objects such as hot wheels and pet toys grow and shrink. There is none of that here. The old gang from the other Ant-man films are also sadly missing. What's left is very static and stale‚Ä¶

I had fun but I also enjoy these types of films. I can imagine that this type of movie will appeal to some but it may be grating to others. It all depends on whether the person is willing to engage with a movie of this type with the established characters of the previous film."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"So I might be in the minority here, but what is every critic on Rotten Tomatoes smoking? This was the weirdest, most fun, and most exciting Marvel movie since ""Endgame."" Yeah, there's a lot crammed in it (like there is in every Marvel property these days), but I felt it did pretty well by al of its characters (except maybe for Evangeline Lilly's Wasp, who unfortunately gets a little left behind with everything else going on). That being said, you've got Michelle Pfeiffer kicking @$$ and blasting aliens... come on, people!
It's not the same quirkiness that you got in the first two Ant-Man films, but come on, folks, this guy has now fought Thanos himself... things are going to change. Kathryn Newton is just a lot of fun as Scott's daughter (""Stature"" in the comics for all you heavy duty Marvel geeks), and I felt the family dynamic is on point and that Cassie never became overly annoying. 
This is definitely Marvel's version of ""Star Wars"" (even more than the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films were), and I say that in a good way. Lots of good visual weirdness and creatures galore.
So, let's talk about the villain. Jonathon Majors is just absolutely brilliant as Kang, and since he's going to be the big bad moving forward for a while, we're in good hands there. Some may wonder why you perhaps ""waste"" him in an Ant-Man movie, but he's not wasted... it actually brings about interesting developments in the story of the Pyms and the Van Dynes from the previous two films (as well as giving some necessary conflict for the Langs). And while I've read some of the quibbles about how come this Kang wouldn't be able to do certain things, let's realize that he was the Kang that was able to be vanquished and banished to the Quantum Realm.  There are much more dangerous Kangs to come. Anyway, Majors is just electric to watch and makes for a great foil for Scott and the rest.
So, I don't know what to tell all of the sourpusses who have been panning this movie, but this Marvel fan really enjoyed it... almost loved it... and I think it does well at getting Phase 5 off to a good start, and I can't wait for what's to come."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this movie and it's microcosmic world building of the Quantum Realm and yet MCU continues to hit the feels. Laughter and emotions. Critics are critics... This movie is a must see for these next phases. Multiverse Saga is on the way and it ain't stopping!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's like a pilot episode for Coming Kang Dynasty and Secret wars

Jonathan Majors as Kang Godd He Stole the Show mann
Yes the movie has Negatives but it also Positives

3.75/5"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Thought it was a decent movie to open up the next phase of the MU.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The best way to begin Phase 5
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan majors performance is incredible!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I dont get where the negativity is coming from.

This isnt a GREAT movie let me start with that i think it sits a little above Thor love and thunder and a little under Doctor strange and the multiverse of madness

These kind of movies i allways marvel at the way they shape the 'realms'  like how interesting out there ideas are taken shape, like living buildings and half sentient half machine like creatures. The movie is an absolute experience , it keeps its conclusion very vague untill the very end.

So the story follows our hero antman and company trough the quantum realm thanks to Cassie making a hubble space telescope but for the quantum realm. Chaos ensues when the beacon is picked up by the entity that rules the quantum realm and Janet knows more then she lets on. our heroes get entangled in the quantum realm via vacuum teleportation and now have to figure out how to get home while also dealing with the dangers that lurk in the realm

I really love how some of the actors just Set a presence. Paul Rudd is allways a delight to see as Scott Lang, and newcomer Jonathan Majors Really sets an imposing villain ( different from he who remains at the end of loki season 1)

Look if you are not  a fan ( like appearntly most people leaving revieuws on here are, then this movie isnt for you ) but THERES way worse then this. Eternals WAS incredibly boring and thor love and thunder went too far on the humor side that tone couldnt catch a break

This movie goes full marvel and i love that it does that"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great introduction to the big bad of Phase 5, enough jokes to keep this one fun but enough foreboding elements to understand trouble is coming."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible. Ant-Man's selling point is affable Paul Rudd winking at the camera about his knowingly lame shrinking hero. But after 20 minutes of that he's dumped in a pre-loaded CGI environment where the ""alien"" inhabitants have all the depth and character of the cast of a 1930s Flash Gordon serial, complete with an alliterative tyrant baddy. They fight for literally 2 hours, then the villain loses AND wins because there are multiple multiverse versions of him and the outcome doesn't really matter. This might be my last cinema-visit Marvel movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, great FX, Leads into the next story like Marvel always does so well. Stay for both end credit scenes!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Watch Loki last episode 1st. It isn't like Star Wars.  Best Antman movie and nicely ties them together.  Good popcorn movie.  Best since Endgame.  Enjoy don't overthink.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Me and my 9 year old daughter really enjoyed it. King was great. The world building was amazing and it really kicked off Phase 5 in a great way
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie.  Was lost of fun, action.  Not sure what's all the negativity about.  Jonathan Majors is amazing as Kang."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was neat to see the quantum realm more, but the plot was very lack luster and underperformed. The villain's story is pretty vague."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Could‚Äôve been a lot better. This one felt like it was milked dry
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie. To only begin to describe it, was everything I hoped for and more. Kang rattled me to my core every time he came on screen. This is a perfect start to phase 5."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Doesn't deserve all the hate from the critics. The acting and direction were great. It had a good balance of drama and comedy. The pacing was fantastic. The CGI was great. The action sequences were well executed. One of my favorite MCU films. Sets up the future well and Majors is an incredible talent. Must see if you're a Marvel fan.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the dumbest 'and then' movies. Also you just gotta love that spicy socialist line, it's definitely not out of political motives and definitely makes sense in how it's said. Yep, nothing wrong here, also nothing to see here, just avoid this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Acredito que √© um filme que vale a pena ser assistido sim!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great introduction to phase 5. Great action. Not too much comedy. Kang was an amazing villain. Although felt like a Star Wars movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it had a great mix of comedy and action that have made the Ant Man series a joy to watch so far, even though this is quite a departure from the previous films in terms of story. But the real winner here is Jonathan Majors. His Kang was the standout of the film and I look forward to what he does with him next."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. Don't listen to the critics, had everything you'd expect in Ant man & more."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,My wife enjoyed our time at the movies watching Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"** No Spoilers** 
Great movie for the family! Everyone enjoyed it. Fantastic special effects, great acting, good story. Definitely better than Thor L&T, Eternals & on par or slightly better than Dr. Strange MoM. Not too long runtime when compared with Wakanda Forever and I don't get why some people think there's too much going on in the storyline. I felt it was just enough and every scene was necessary. I can watch this movie over and over."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually wonderful, Ant-Man corny & a good precipice for the beginning of phase 5."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie wish it showed more of Kang being KANG the CONQUEROR
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ein guter Auftakt f√ºr die 5. Phase des MCU mit einem herausragendem Antagonisten, der Lust auf mehr macht.

Nicht alle Gags funktionieren, aber die Ant-Man Leichtigkeit bleibt trotz der gro√üen Thematik erhalten.

Visuell typischer Marvel-Look - sicher nicht auf Avatar 2 Niveau, aber doch sehr ansehnlich.

Tolle Filmmusik."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Super fun! Laugh out loud! Great action. All the characters had opportunities to shine in their character strengths
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it very much. Pfeiffer is great, Douglas seems to enjoy this more than should be allowed. Majors is a brillant villain, soon to be a lot of villains, it seems. And Rudd is ... Rudd. And the design of this Quantum Realm is awesome. To the critics who complain about this not being ""arthouse"" - yes you're right, and I don't want it to be. The comics aren't Dostojewski either."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An average marvel. Not exciting, not so bad either. Just average. The story is not well developped, too many characters that can be explored.
This movie doesn't launch the phase 5 of marvel as explained"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Felt like I was watching a bad Star Wars movie with all the different aliens species.the juice they drink to understand the aliens was copied from Rick and Morty, everything was super predictable But still funny!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was fun, stylistically amazing, visually extraordinary, and did I mention it was fun? The stakes always felt high, but the tone remained light. The cast nailed it. Forget the critics. Some films are just meant to be fun, and this one really succeeds at it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I had so much fun watching this movie. I think the critics need to take a pause and reevaluate their reviews. This is the first Phase Five movie and OMG this phase is going to be awesome.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good but there was a lot of plot armor during the movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Basically the entire movie takes place on a green screen. Recently every marvel movie feels like a cheap ripoff of Guardians of the Galaxy with aliens, spaceships, & lasers. Remember the charm of Antman 1? It's all gone. It's just another ""the world is ending"" space epic that doesn't happen in space. Paul Rudd is perfect, but everything else is very cheesy. A lot of the dialogue feels FORCED as well, especially from Cassie. Marvel has probably peaked‚Ä¶ oh well."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm genuinely mystified as to how this movie got a  lower critics' score than Thor: Love and Thunder (which I felt had a far too rapidly-disjointed first act due to the apparent extensive cuts they made ‚Äî I still think there may be a good movie hiding in there, however), or The Eternals.
Quantumania (the name aside) flowed well, the humor was in keeping with the other Ant-Man films, and Jonathan Majors was excellent. Was the film perfect? No. One of the best Marvel movies? No. But was it was a solid film, and a firm foundation on which to build the next MCU phase? Absolutely. The 48% critic review makes absolutely no sense."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,The special effects were wonderful and the story was ok.  It had the typical good blend of Marvel drama and comedy in it.  Not Marvel's best but not their worst either.  Our particular party enjoyed it.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,*Spoilers:- Ant-Man and the Wasp : Quantumania is not the most perfect marvel movie but it is a really good movie that introduces us to the real Kang after Loki started the Multiverse saga in the Loki series by killing He who remains aka the good version Kang and the movie acts as a perfect introduction for new characters such as Cassy and finally shows us Janet in action.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun family movie! Jonathan Majors was awesome as Kang.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,What a great movie to start Phase 5!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyable movie despite some flaws. The main cast is great to watch, and the world that's been created is very imaginative. Very solid and ominous kickoff of the Kang storyline."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Way to over-hated - no it wasn't the most jaw dropping storyline, definitely not compared to movies like endgame and no way home, but it was still a very fun movie and the absolute best introduction to phase 5!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"There‚Äôs always room for improvement, especially with Marvel movies, but I can honestly say I enjoyed this one. Haven‚Äôt really enjoyed a Marvel movie since No Way Home because either its a big nothing burger like MoM or too over the top funny like Love and Thunder. What I enjoyed the most though was Kang. Great villain. Can‚Äôt wait to see more of him."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a great introduction of Kang to the broader MCU! Phase 5 is shaping up to be heavily focused on establishing this new Avengers level threat and I'm all for it! The movie had a lot of humor, some interesting new side characters, and the Quantum Realm was both beautiful and dangerous. I highly recommend Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania because it simply is a fun movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible movie. Really fun. The visuals were great. Story was fun. Everything was fun. The critics are so wrong about this one it was very very funny and deserves an incredible amount of praise. The negativity about this film is just sheep culture. Not oscar worthy but a must watch for anyone who loves the mcu or just like silly and stupid comedy.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a fitting 3rd instalment to the Ant-Man Saga. Too many people are hating on the plot, which wasn't bad but also wasn't good for a Marvel movie.

Kang was a very strong villain, which will help to setup the next phases and the future  Avengers movies. However, there were no real stakes, so overall only 4 star.

Worth watching."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a great movie but got overhated.. For me.. Its okay for opening phase 5 but hope I can see more of Kang. And the ending a lil bit so easy... But nahh it's okay, it's ant man movie what u expect.."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well acted, lots of action and visually stunning. Looking forward to seeing the characters in other movies. "
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie and great performances!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant Man Quantumania is not nearly as bad as critics make it out to be‚Ä¶ it is a fun, visually stunning ride into the Quantum Realm that has a great balance of humor and seriousness. Kang the Conqueror is an awesome villain, and it is a movie that sets him up as a threat for the MCU very well. If I had any criticism, it might be that it got a little slow in the middle, but the third act was truly spectacular and had me on the edge of my seat. This is Marvel‚Äôs Star Wars, and it is a great start to Phase 5. Don‚Äôt listen to the film snobs and go see it for yourself, then make your opinion. "
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic film, ignore the critics it was much better than Thor or Wankanda Forever. Kang is excellent and the story and action were refreshing."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie!!!!
These critics have lost their minds and have forgotten what a great movie is!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was expecting it to be a bad movie. I saw it on opening night and man was I blown away. Paul Rudd was a great choice for Ant-Man. Evangeline Lilly was amazing in this movie as well. She's great in all 3. 
  Michael Douglas was amazing too. The graphics and the scenery in this movie was awesome. Great actors over all. They story was funny and exciting. Jonathan Majors was so amazing as Kang The Conqueror. He honestly should sign a deal with MCU to dawn the character for a while. I give this movie a 10/10. I'm definitely seeing this again."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this movie very much it was action packed and comical with a twist 9/10 for me 
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lot of action, funny movie, Kang is going to be a great villain!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was disappointing, coming from a die hard marvel fan we have to stop supporting marvel and Disney just because they made good movies in the past. It doesn't make up for their lack of effort, attention to detail and the lack of respect for us fans who know what we should expect from these movies. As for the movie itself, it's an incoherent story that had way too many changes in what it wanted to be. They made kang feel not important as someone who is very smart and ruthless they essentially gave him the Illuminati treatment from the multiverse of madness. They wasted Modok and killed him off when he should be a staple kind of character and he just seemed like a joke. This movie should have been a small level movie no pun intended. They didn't need to try and make an avengers level movie because if you do so you need to hit certain beats and it fell far from them. Plus they pull far away from what the ant man movies were. Plus I'll take a star away for not having Michael Pe√±a. 1-1/2 stars is all this deserves. The actors are not at fault for terrible writing and directing. We should expect better and marvel and Disney need to do better."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The storyline is complicated and boring. MCU totally sucks after the avengers: endgame. Please stop the multiverse storyline, just be simple like the old MCU. You definitely will lose from DC Universe that is simpler and more relatable"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worse of MCU ever!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"So yeah, Phase 4 was rough but also not expected to be the powerful end-all phase, rather a lighthearted intro phase. Phase 5 kicking off with Quantumania has big shoes to fill because we know how good it CAN be(Infinity War, for example). But this is the intro film...and I found it to be visually gorgeous. There is some comedy, but not ""in-your-face"" Love and Thunder levels. There is some emotion, though not much... Michelle Pfeiffer was wooden imo, Hope was a side-note and I'm not sure Paul Rudd can play anything aside from snark(though he does it well). Newcomer Cassie has evolved to be a powerhouse in her own right so that speaks well to the future and Majors/Kang...we all knew he'd be great since Loki. I'm more excited about what this sets up than I was about the movie, I've been eager to justify my devotion for a while now. Audience is 85% and critics are bombing it, so there's clearly a disconnect...but this was enjoyable, action-packed(predictable also) and brimming with consequences. My biggest complaint is that, like most superhero movies, everything was so convenient and predictable. We're losing, oh...backup arrived...over and over and over. But I personally put this in top 10 MCU for me...if not barely. Doesn't deserve the 48% hate, imo."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"An entertaining watch, in line with what you expect from the AntMan  franchise. Jonathan Majors, as Kang, is as expected the star here, and Jeff Loveness (screenwriter) and Peyton Reed (director) do a pretty good job of incorporating his dark character into what most expect to be a fun and silly movie. But, serious Marvel fans will find & have legitimate issues, the greatest of which may be that Ant Man was just the wrong vehicle to fully introduce Kang to the Marvel Universe. But, the casual viewer, who isn't concerned with every detail will come away fully satisfied at this ""Disney park""-like ride of an adventure. Buckle up and enjoy the ride!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, had really great one liners always great to see the gender be serious and funny mixed. Wish Thor 4 followed this format. Great acting great setting and plot. Beginning of the Kang Dynasty is upon us"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie might be dumb but just dont think about it too hard and you can find a really good movie here
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall a solid marvel film in all honesty. The characters are all super intriguing- especially Kang, who could steal any scene he was a part of- and the story was just a fun yet darker tone than what usually would be considered for an ant man movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think it was the most ambitious Antman and Wasp installment yet. It was a good watch and set up the big bad Kang!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As an avid marvel fan, this movie was just awful. The visual effects were good, the acting was good. The screenplay tho? I believe a 5 year old could write a more intriguing and engaging story. Absolutely the worst writing marvel has produced in the last 5 years."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok but I guess it serves its purposes as to continue the story of the marvel universe as it unfolds
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I never post reviews, but the critic scores on RT are getting out of hand. This movie wasn't perfect, but it was entertaining and fun, and certainly was way better than almost every movie released in Phase 4. General rule of thumb -- disregard the critic scores on always base your decisions to see a movie on the audience scores."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, had the same comedy that I would find in previous ant man movies, but the addition of Kang as a threat just elevated the stakes that much more... Would 100% go watch it again when it releases on Disney plus..."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was good. The side story was a little silly and not totally needed. Jonathan Majors, as always, was fantastic as Kang. Little less CGI, as in no need to filter Michael Douglas's or Michelle Pfeiffer's faces. Age is nothing to be afraid of. I really liked it. Make sure you stay until the very end credits."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful VFX Awesome BGM.
Story is not very strong but definitely on a higher side as compared to other Ant Man movies. Ant Man on a serious side is much appreciated."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It's better than ant man 2 and Thor 4. Why it's getting the hate from the critics that it is getting us beyond me. Kang is the highlight of the movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Marvel quicks off Phase 5 with a fun movie does what he needs to do: it's funny and gorgeuos.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good Marvel movie that finally told a good story and was entertaining. Also, action picked."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is super good-looking, I like the setting of Quantum Realm, and the fighting feeling is fullÔºÅ"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the new ant-man movie. I seen it in 3D and the chairs move up and down and side to side like a roller coaster.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Loved Paul Rudd. Michael Douglas solid as ever. Need to bring back Pena actor‚Äîthat give and take was lacking. Plot was stupid. Evangeline Lilly was shortchanged in this interpretation of her character. SFX were overdone. Two trailers. Loki shows back up in second.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was a disappointment
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"With Johnathon Majors being the highlight as Kang the Conqueror, along with a fun cast, cool action, and setting off the rest of the MCU in a huge way making this a great watch and a great introduction to Phase 5 despite some of the movies issues."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Went into this movie thinking it would be a dud, with how the critics reviewed it.  But wow, they were wrong.  SO MUCH FUN.  Not sure what critics have against CBM lately, but y'all were dead wrong about this one and Black Adam.  Very entertaining movie, with a TON of new world building, and weird little characters.  Tons of humor, which I really enjoyed and it didnt feel forced at all (looking at you, Love and Thunder).  Modoks hand movement got me every time for whatever reason lol.  Really enjoyed the similar parallels of Stark to Thanos and Lang to Kang. The music was a little lackluster and I miss Luis, but that would be my only complaint (Evangeline's hair was horrible too, sorry).  Definitely the best Antman.  
Overall, gave it a 86/100.  Go see for yourself!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a very good movie.. I dont know the critics rated the movie... the story is very simple yet it was shown in a very good way...didn't seem to be bored with any scene...the vfx is top notch... there so many wow moments. overall it was a very good movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Disfrutable y entretenida, me la he pasado bien quizas podia tener un mejor gui√≥n hay algunos agujeros y no desaprovechar a MODOK.
El CGI es aceptable a bueno.
Jonathan Majors es una gran actuaci√≥n como KANG espero mucho m√°s de KANG para el futuro.
2 Escenas postcredito muy buenas la segunda me a encantado."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"When it comes to a Marvel movie, this was fantastic with its scope. As an Ant Man movie this was probably the lesser of the three. Ant Man has been a more intimate story with his family and a fourth movie should return to that smaller scope of storytelling. With that said, it does not diminish that this is a 5 star movie with it's vision of the quantum realm, development of characters and execution of its concepts and emotions."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible job on explaining who Kang is, his objective & why he wants to accomplish that objective. He's just there..."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoy it a lot, good action, Kang is a great character, I can't understand some critics, it's stupid to compare every movie with endgame. You won't get dissapointed"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything you'd expect, nothing you won't - except the unwelcome wokeness of the recent marvel films. Go into it with some popcorn and have a good time."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Should have waited for Disney plus. Then I could have at least cleaned the house with it on in the background.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme de CGI p√©ssimo deixaram o filme escuro para esconder o filme se chama Homem Formiga e Vespa mas que gira em torno da Vespa idosa, Kang uma hora √©  poderoso outra n√£o  depois √©  poderoso depois nao √©  vai entender esse filme s√≥ n√£o √© pior que Thor Amor e Trov√£o mas me arrependo de ter comprado o ingresso!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Story is kinda shallow but good nonetheless.  The special effects are top notch . The length is just right,  some Marvel movies are way too long. I liked the movie overall"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun. Fanny. Two hours of  fun to the mind.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The 3rd installment in the Ant-Man franchise was finished in  a daring fashion. Aside from the CGI and the well developed world of the Quantum Realm the movie hit each note very well! The story was compelling and a great first chapter in the new saga. Each character‚Äôs story was pretty well done, barring some minor flaws. The performance of each character, Major‚Äôs Kang standing out, was incredible. I haven‚Äôt felt the presence of a superhero Villian like Kang in theaters since Thanos and Kang, pure raw power backed up by well delivered lines and incredible performance. My only issue was the performances of a couple of the characters and certain powerful moments diminished by (in my opinion) poor execution. Regardless, I left the theater with a smile and the eagerness to see what Marvel has in store!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was surprisingly good. All the other more recent Marvel movies have been terrible. I know it could just be that my expectations are so low at this point that anything with a couple of good lines and Paul Rudd seems fantastic but I overall enjoyed this movie. 

I'll admit though that a lot of the things they did with this movie felt unearned. There were some powerful scenes that left me feeling let down because they were just there to be...emotional or powerful with no real lead-up to it. 

Also, Kathryn Newton was not the right choice for a strong main character in this movie. She let down many aspects of the character and left me wanting more. There is one scene that is meant to be compelling to the audience. She's calling on people to come and fight, to win back their kingdoms and to stop running away. This striking scene which should be an easy touch down is instead fumbled by Newton. Rather than feeling emotional and empowered, I felt bored and unimpressed. She's absolutely not entirely at fault for how disappointing her character is. The way her character is written is annoying and entitled. Overall her character is just irritating. It just seems like she, and the writers of this movie needed a few more years under their belt before they tried to act/write in such a big-name movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie, I liked it a lot."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I disliked the overall storyline.  The multiverse thing is out of hand and takes from the viewing pleasure for trying to remain cognizant of the story. When you watch a Marvel Movie, you expect an easy story with lots of action with a little comedy. But this was painful."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania managed to maintain the balance between a good MCU movie and a good movie on its own. Despite Kang being foreshadowed as the big bad of the upcoming Avengers movies, he fits in nicely in a movie of this scale without being nerfed too much. I went in expecting Kang to be the highlight of the movie, and I was not disappointed. Jonathan Majors crushed it as Kang. However, the plot itself was surprisingly coherent and competent enough (especially compared to some recent Marvel IPs) that Kang's presence didn't have to compensate for a lack of plot, rather it reinforced it. 

**Spoilers ahead**

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

MODOK on the other hand was a wasted opportunity. It was surprising to see Darren Cross, AKA Yellowjacket from the first movie, being back as MODOK. And I really liked how he was turned into a weapon by Kang. But his the way his death was treated as a comedic relief (and not even a good one) was a wasted potential. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Spoiler over** 

All things considered, this movie sets up the next big event in the multiverse saga. Kang is a beast. And he can be a terrifying villain too if treated properly. But he's not the only one out there. I just hope his character is done justice, and not wasted like Gorr from Love and Thunder. 

Quantumania is one of the better MCU movies of this phase. It has the entertainment value of the previous Ant-man movies and an ever expanding plot that connects to the larger multiverse. I'd definitely recommend watching it. 

Stick around for the end credits scenes. Both of them."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,one of the best marvel movies very funny very underatted
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining movie with good acting and wonderful VFX all around. Not all movies can be EndGame level complex. Did not feel bored. Like my friend mentioned it is concept of ‚ÄòJourney to Mysterious island'  but set in Quantum realm!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent entry into phase 5. Paul Rudd is as funny as ever and Jonathon Majors is such a talented actor who is shaping up to be a wonderful villain. Must watch!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,audience reviews >>>
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is lit üî• beautiful start to Phase 5 üôåüèº
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Not the best Marvel film but I feel at this point our expectation level is such that we can't have fun watching a move any more. Quantumania was fun that's all I expect a superhero film to be.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was a great movie 10/10
The critics are spineless and it's clear the actual audience likes this movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fine. The first 2 thirds are enjoyable set design, costume and vfx are good.

However the ""big bad"" of the saga ""kang"" they have been teasing is shown in the last third to be no problem at all, barely an inconvenience. His army and empire he's been building for 30 or so years is brought down in less than a day, by Ant-man, his daughter who just started and is a science genius and fighter, wasp, some ants and a rag-tag bunch of village people.

In short there is nothing to fear in kang. 


TLDR:
With the lower quality of writing marvel has been pumping out recently. I had hoped this film could get the mcu back on track and set up a big threat, to look forward to. 

Instead it was mediocre, formulaic where the only surprise is how underwhelming  the new ""bad"" is."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Storyline was boring and its the only Marvel movie which felt really dragging to date.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"the visual effect was so good, its funny but the plot was not that deep just for entertaining i guess. Still worths my time cuz its the part after the loki series back in 2021 and the after credits also show comeback of loki 2 and kang so its was not that bad"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie lacked the humor we have come to love with Marvel but it also didn't quite capture the heart. The artistic choices of the setting and new characters felt like if Star Wars and Monsters Inc had a baby.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,See it and I love it  kang was the best villain
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely love the new Ant-Man, this is not the same old Marvel comedy, this actually has a fantastic SYFY realm and message to always stand up for the little guy!
It's a fun time to get out and see something new in the Marvel universe and it doesn't disappoint!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Crazy that anyone would rate this movie anything but exceptional!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While I did not hate this movie, it is not all that great and it just confirms that the best days of the MCU are truly behind it. Video review: https://youtu.be/2Sr96x2oZHQ"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very silly and not great.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Well at least it was better than Love and Thunder. I don't know why but for a movie starring Paul Rudd, he felt strangely absent for about half the film. A lot of the acting all around (minus Jonathan Majors) felt phoned in? Maybe it was because of all the green screen set-pieces. Whole first half of the movie felt like a floaty dream. A lot of plot conveniences that get explained away in single lines. Overall not a -bad- movie but I wish it had more time in the oven to clean up some things."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Alot of people just don't like ant-man and it shows. I thought the movie was great a solid 7 and a half or 8 out of 10. Johnathan Majors did a great job as kang, and I can't wait to see him in the future of the MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"funny, lots of action and amazing scenes. kang was awesome! great movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fun, i had a great time watching, its got problems dont get me wrong but it was very good, The CGI was very good in general, M.O.D.O.K looked goofy but that was the point, he is even uglier in the comics, Kang was amazing, Jonathan Majors performance is fantastic. The end credit scenes were very good, the second one in particular hyped me more since we will get resolution earlier in Loki Season 2 unlike the other one which we will likely have to wait until Kang Dinasty. The side characters were pretty funny. Wasp was under used even tho her name is in the title. We got Paul Rudds best performance in the MCU. Kathryn Newton was very good. And there was not a lot of Bill Murray. In general it was very fun, i recomend it, it has problems but it is good.

After multiple rewatches its not 3 and a half anymore, its just gone down a lot, its cringey at times, 3 stars"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this movie alot its worth seeing
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Johnathan Majors as Kang steals the movie carrying the whole thing on his back, he may need to see a doctor for back injuries. It could've been a better movie but i enjoyed it. Its the same problem with Thor 4. Its like they wanted a funny movie but at the same time they add in a terrifying villain where the tone does go here and there."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie.  Great story and action, along with more insight into Kang.  Looking forward more!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Its a lot better than other reviews would make you believe, although the MODOK VFX are awful"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Was entertaining. Funny. Was good
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this film but it was so predictable and lacked the qualities that made its predecessors fun to watch. Peyton Reed's decision to base all CGI characters on The Phantom Menace, is completely overwhelming and detrimental to the overall storyline. Unfortunately for Marvel fans not even Jonathan Majors could save this movie from itself. Quantumania is bloated with campiness and predictability that makes  it a mediocre film at best. I'm uncertain on Marvels intent here, but it feels like they were aggressively pursuing a PG rating for Quantumania rather than PG-13. If Marvel would have put the same effort into the script as they did with visual effects, this could have easily been another solid entry into the portfolio."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great way to take Kang further in the MCU after Loki S1 finished. 2 Post creds btw.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Nothing more and nothing less than I expected. Super fun comic book movie. That's it. Tune out and have fun.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It's Enjoyable without being an Avengers movie. Critics hating for no reason. It's a decent Marvel movie that sets up the future. Stop hating üçÖ
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was SOOO boring. The MCU is dead.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cgi was amazing.Really 10/10. Acting was decent without counting Jonathan Majors Kang which he plays really great. So 5/10. But characters are the biggest disappointing that I ever saw. I was expecting this Kang to be a real menace. I tough that he's gonna be better than Tanos . And I know that Kang the conquer is great villain but in the comics. Disney show him from really disappointing side because he had to be ''for kids''. It's not the way of making superheroes movies without violence and really bad guys. For this 2/10. Beside this story was same bad as in Thor love and thunder and doctor strange multiverse of madness. Bad/unfunny jokes, young cringy superhero(here Cassie lang), and story that came from nothing at the beginning. Story was too fast and predictable. Oh and of course the heroes always win. This is most common thin in the MCU since phase 4. So for story 1/10. So my main rating of this movie is 4/10. Not recommend to watch this at cinema better wait until it's going to release on Disney+   to  save money."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Im not sure if they are curating the reviews, or what, but this was NOT any better then phase 4. I gave it one last try, and it was AWFUL. I mean I suppose if you have completely low expectations, you might like it. Oh well, Im sure it will get its money back in China."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not nearly as bad as everyone is making it out to be. It‚Äôs fun, Kang is awesome, and overall a great finale for Scott Lang."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme fraquissmo,  quase nada se salva. O vil√£o kang que prometia ser mais poderoso que o thanos, sendo que na verdade ele √© um vil√£o muito ruim e fraco, a unica coisa que eu gostei foi da ultima cena pos creditos"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't know what the critics are talking about, the movie was fantastic. Really sets the scene for the villain ahead and how powerful they are but also plenty of action and laughs along the way!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked the story and how Kang got introduced to the audience and also the Quantum Realm. It's had the perfect amount of comedy and fun. It was overall awesome and I would recommend watching it!!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The only good actors are the ones who makes  Kang and Scot Lang‚Ä¶ The lang girl is, I'm sorry, garbage‚Ä¶
And‚Ä¶ Socialist Ants and revolutionaries against The Conqueror?? They are not even trying to hide it, they are throwing in our faces!!! And, once more, without really significantly story for that‚Ä¶
Lazy writing all the time!! Kang is all powerful, defeating ant man and the others so easily and at the end a bunch ants and ""redeemed MORDOK"" (saved by a line of Scot's daughter) defeats him? 
Seriously, I'm huge fan of MCU, seeing at the premier since the beginning of everything but I don't know if I will keep watching it‚Ä¶ 

But to be fair, Kang is awesome! Kind of saves the movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Me gusto la pel√≠cula los escenarios se ven bien aunque se nota la pantalla verde, kang es un gran villano e impone, nos muestra que no tiene miedo a matar para lograr su cometido, Lo malo es que MODOK es un chiste, Kang tuvo una ""muerte"" rid√≠cula y el final es muy gen√©rico de que el h√©roe gana y es feliz. En general est√° bueno pero con algunas fallas."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dissapointed movie. The Fantastic world of Quantimania seems to be a great story of video Game, secundaries characters not add anything. Marvel anda Fargie are obstinates yo make a great superhero becomes a stupidhero , as same as Thor! Boring since begining yo ending... Even Khan falldown in this disaster"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved it. KANG is going to be a powerhouse in the MCU
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Very solid movie. It is what you should expect from a marvel movie by now. Grab the popcorn and just enjoy it. The critics are to full of themselves
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A wild ride from beginning to end. Quantumania sets the stage for the future if the MCU while also providing a fun, exciting and very different  Ant Man sequel. A must see!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's such a good movie! There's amazing action and visuals and just enough humor to keep me laughing but the perfect amount of severity to make me pay close attention the entire movie. I believe it was the best into to marvel phase 5 we could have gotten. 

There will be many bad reviews about this movie for ignorant and wacky reasons but people just like to complain so whatever. I just wanted to watch a movie that would entertain me like all movies should do and this one absolutely delivers."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Para m√≠, un buen inicio, tampoco es la mejor pel√≠cula del UCM pero definitivamente es un mejor trabajo que las cintas de la fase 4. Creo que, aunque tiene sus defectos como cualquier otra pel√≠cula, cumple mis espectativas."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I completely disagree with the critics. This movie was all it needed to be. Fun, entertaining, epic and an odissey of colors. Best Star Wars movie since revenge of the sith, it completely gives the vibes! Outstanding performance by Paul Rudd as Ant-Man and Jonathan Majors as Kang, it was such a powerfull villain, he will make the avengers suffer for sure. The presentation of the quantum realm world it's astonishing, with lots of different locations and characters. Cassie's and Hope's chemistry with Scott it's wholesome, they really add to the movie. Hank Pym and Janet surprised me, they had really cool scenes in wich they were absolutely ruling it!!! 
The only thing I wouldn't pass (SPOILERS) about the movie is MODOK's ending, he was presented in this film very differently than the comics (peak humor by the way), but I thought Marvel could make him more serious and terrifying in other movies, but they killed him so... Also, the rythm is very fast, they could make it slower to take things a bit more calmly.
Solid 8 out of 10!!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was funny,cgi was amazing yet it lacks with showing how powerful kang is . Johnathan majors acting was great same with Paul Rudd yet bill Murray wasnt unit long enough. I wasn't bored all through out this film. It's like marvel combined with Star Wars and made this. Some may disagree with me here , I enjoyed MODOK and his cgi was fine . It felt like phase 3 marvel ."

"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"very decent movie, only complain is that we dont get one of those Luis stories xD, new villain did a great job \m/ cant wait to see more of him"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"La verdad no fui con muchas expectativas, por eso no me desilusion√© con la pel√≠cula. Sirve para pasar el rato, nada m√°s."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was visually amazing! I like that the movie is told from multiple viewpoints to give you a total view of the story. Jonathan Major is the perfect super bad for a marvel movie and the comedic breaks make the movie very enjoyable. The movie gets way more hate than it should.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked this movie. It helped me to learn to look out for the little guy. Thank you, Scott Lang."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Though certainly not without its flaws, the third instalment of the Ant-man series continues to build upon the world that its characters have found themselves in, showcasing meaningful character growth, and satisfying this movie goers thirst for humerus, science-fiction entertainment. Plot holes seem inevitable this day and age, so some forgiveness is offered for moments of uneven pacing. Altogether, a good film with good performances from its cast. Think Thor: Ragnarok meets Spiderman: Far From Home with a touch of something near to Avengers: Endgame-like stakes mixed in."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as two previous Ant movies. Almost Star Wars like movie costumes and characters used in this movie. Also, it seems movie is trying to act like Guardians movies. Kindof reminds me of things borrowed from othe Marvel Dosney movies. Very loud action scenes are good. Not bad movie but not great either. This movie looks like one that will be included in Disney + streaming and video sales in short time after theater release."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazed by the meaning and plot of the movie. Really should watch this movie guyss!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Not what I expected from a Marvel film in a good way. Excited to see where they take Cassie and Scott's final bit gives the impression of trouble to come.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a good movie. I was pleasantly surprised how Marvel was able to create such a large story in one movie that didn‚Äôt seem underwhelming in the end.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its like Star Wars movie in MCU, and the best part is Kang.üëçüèª"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's a fun romp through the quantum realm. Absolutely worth seeing and an important contextual movie for the ongoing MCU.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another numbing, soulless CGI soup that strands its talented stars in cosplay posturings of easy emotions."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-man and the Wasp Quantumania delivers where Phase 4 was lacking. Unlike Thor Love and Thunder this movie paces the jokes, action, and serious moments very well. The movie introduces us to some fun/cool looking characters that all have their moments. Also the 2 post credit scenes actually feel important and show us where the story is going. Overall great movie I would definitely see it again."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie felt like its only purpose was to serve the greater storyline instead of being a great movie first with the benefit of serving the broader storyline. Kang and Janet Van Dyne carry the plot forward even if at times it felt as if there were 3 separate stories that, at some point, conveniently came together. Character and plot arcs feel forced."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a pretty funny and enjoyable movie. Not the best movie ever but still pretty good
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie just introduce a new character. The people was waiting for something like Avengers End Game, when Marvel is showing us how powerfull and limitless the character of Kang could be.

Just enjoy the movie, the best of Ant-Man yet."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Yikes.
Jonathan Majors is fantastic.
That's it.
There is nothing else about this movie that is memorable."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved this movie!
Is was great seeing how Scott, Hope, Hank, Janet and Cassie have become a close family unit of scientific superheroes. And Kang is going to be a fantastic villain in the Multiverse Saga. Looking forward to seeing more of all of them, especially Hope and Scott.
Brilliant start to phase 5."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Charismatic movie from all angles. The only thing I didn't like much is the way they made Modok look
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ok while it has some flaws I liked it .. Paul Rudd is very good and funny as always .. I love the interaction between Scott and Cassie .. and Kang -!! Majors is awesome ... can't wait for more Kang .. However , I agree with another review that the Quantum Realm scenes are a bit too much - especially with some of the other recent world building I have seen (Avatar).. less would have been more ... and the post credits scene was really neat ... two of may favorites .."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What I liked before Marvel is that we could see heroes who, based on effort, mistakes and perseverance, improved and were the ones who saved others, and even so, they ended up injured. For example, Tony made his armor based on many tests, and despite the fact that it improved, they continued to perfect it in each movie because the enemies were more powerful than him. Captain America was a young man with great conviction but he was weak, his determination made him the symbol of his country and to save them he ended up frozen for years, to later become the heart of a team again... now everything is a script, pure Mary Sue that everything turns out perfect the first time and that they are always right... I mean, at the time I loved seeing Natasha fight, because she was ingenious, now... well, they don't make an effort."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Marvel movies are great because they connect to each other. Ant-Man was funny and action-packed. The story, in my opinion, focused too much on Janet. I would have like to see more references to other movies too. But it was fun anyway."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am a huge MCU fan and was so excited to see this movie and how the multiverse / Kang storyline would progress. 
After seeing it last night I would say that this movie was great (a lot better than TLAT) and Kang The Conqueror was bad ass. I enjoyed the focus on Janet and her story and how the Ants made a come back at the end (keeping the ant theme alive). The Quantum Citadel and the idea of a whole universe beneath ours was super cool. The way they brought back D from the first movie was thought through well because he was ultimately defeated by being sucked into the Quantum realm but not sure I loved the way his character's direction went. There was never a part in this film where I thought it was slow or boring.  
Another thing I want to also point out before stating why I am giving this a 4/5 is that I am not a huge acting performance and cgi snob (unless it is AWFUL). I just really love the Marvel storylines so I try not to focus to much on the CGI. SO the knocked off star is for these reasons: 
1. That above statement being said, I think that KN's acting of Cassie lacked 100% effort when portraying emotion. Even when she was trying to be sad / serious, I felt like she was still smiling a little..? 1a. The whole movie had tons of emphasis on her. Her storyline was good. Maybe this means she has a bigger role in the future of MCU? So that's why I am not totally hating. 
2. I wish there was more focus on Kang The Conqueror. The movie made me feel like we didn't get enough of him, but maybe that was done intentionally? We all know he is coming back. 
Cannot wait to see what happens next in the MCU"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Important movie of the franchise.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think it's a great movie, but the are some scene which could be made better"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its was fantastic movie rather than criticize the movie we should enjoy it, no hate to movie ,give it to criticsüòë"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not a perfect movie, but fun enough for me to enjoy."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The Movie felt long. The movie was just average, definitely the worst of the 3 Ant Man movies. "
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and very entertaining. The Ant-Man movies have always been the funniest of the Marvel movies. Can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great 3D and Dbox experience, but Ant-Man is mediocre at best. The Ant-Man movies of the past had less complicated plots and more comedy. This is just another confused multiverse mess. I‚Äôve become more and disappointed with the Marvel experience and this movie doesn‚Äôt change that trend. All good things eventually end and Marvel‚Äôs no different. I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm alone."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked the movie, as is the case with most things Marvel. It had an interesting plot and premise. There was an element of predictability. It was lacking a ""wow"" factor (outside of some very compelling visuals). It did set up future movies though."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it's a great start to phase five.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rehashed boredom from a dozen other movies. 
Walked out. I've NEVER left a Marvel movie before. 
Uninspired."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was great! It was so much fun to see Ant-man taken out of his world and thrown into a place so far away from his friends and comfort. This was a fun ride and cool to see all sorts of new brings. The one and only gripe is MODOK. He is not done well and should not have been in the movie the way they created him. Without him, this would be 5 stars."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,My favorite Marvel movie in a while
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing and Fun movie to watch. What it needed was to show more of Kangs powers and more time to know certain characters.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Eu achei que o filme foi bom mas, n√£o  chega a ser √≥timo. Michelle Pfeiffer e Jonathan Majors fazem um √≥timo trabalho na atua√ß√£o. Majors passa uma impon√™ncia quando est√° em cena e voc√™ sente que ele √© uma grande amea√ßa. Paul Rudd se destaca no filme junto com Kathryn Newton. Evangeline Lilly n√£o aparece tanto no filme quanto nos outros filmes da franquia. O CGI pode falhar em 1 ou 2 momentos no filme mas, de resto, ele √© perfeito e te da uma imers√£o grande no Reino Qu√¢ntico. O filme lembra o universo Star Wars em certas cenas. Fique at√© o final do filme para ver as duas cenas p√≥s cr√©ditos que ser√£o importantes para a expans√£o do universo!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very good movie. Not Marvel's best, definitely not their worst. I enjoyed the comedy, there were some faults that should have been corrected, but everyone plays their role very well. If you're a diehard MCU fan, you'll see all the pieces-parts that it's setting into place, and understand that it can't be a fully standalone movie. Jonathan Majors as Kang is great. The chemistry between the protagonists is very solid. Biggest reason I can see for why critics don't like it is because they aren't watching everything Marvel, and as such don't understand the larger story at work, like judging a puzzle based on one piece. The two end credit scenes are biggies. 

**Spoilers**

The plot is almost exactly like Tron Legacy. I love Tron Legacy so maybe that's why I'm more partial to this one. I know a lot of people didn't like it, so maybe that's why it's getting such a low score."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie can stand alone as a entry into the MCU or be counted as a building block in the next phase of the Marvel cinematic universe. The artistic visual draws the audience in to a world the viewer has yet to experience. While the story although unoriginal meshes together nicely in a non-convoluted way that allows the viewer to be entertained and still follow the story.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think the movie was good, but hate and negativity are the two things that made this a bad movie. Nonetheless, a story and those phenomenal performances were mostly entertaining. In sum, the movie was good."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania isn't a good movie in terms of the fundamentals of what makes a story fit for feature length storytelling. But i had a damn fun time, modok killed it, kang is a worthy challenger for the next big crossover. How it serves the antman family is another story, but nonetheless if you liked rudds scott lang and the core Lang/Pym cast of characters in their previous appearances you'll find something to smile about in this marvel scifi epic. 

It can't be understated how much of a science fiction movie quantumania is. Its so much of a sci-fi movie that it risks losing the average moviegoer. I personally was down with the outlandish scifi concepts from day one but what is charming science fiction to me can be completely infuriating to others. 

This movie doesnt do much to wrap up the other installments of the antman franchise to a satisfying conclusion. This plot of the movie is more suited as a one off episode or season of an AntMan television show. 

Its a 7/10, to me it was a stupidly fun time at the movies and i didnt think of it as anything much deeper. There's also great mcu lore tie ins to Avengers 5 so even if you only see it to be in the loop you should still enjoy yourself."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have no idea why this movie is getting so much hate from critics. This movie is funny, thrilling, and so much better than Thor Love and Thunder‚Ä¶I can not wait to see more of the multiverse! I am even more excited for this stage of Marvel to continue after watching Quantumania. If you didn't like it, maybe watch it one more time to see if you missed anything. ‚úåÔ∏è"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was predictable and drawn out too long. I couldn't relate to the plot.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was okay I guess. Didnt really advance the overall marvel story at all.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Felt like a Marvel movie and a Star Wars movie rolled into one. As a nerd...big fan.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I liked the first two Ant Man movies way more than this one. It felt like they were trying to be too much like Star Wars and Avatar.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,There is no character arc in this movie. Terrible writing kang is not menacing. It‚Äôs like spy kids 3d meets the mcu
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing! It was visually stunning and so much fun! I loved how the actors, particularly Jonathan Majors, completely immersed themselves into their characters! The comic book lore that they were able to delve into has me as a long time comics fan extremely excited for the future of Kang in the MCU! I mean they were actually able to display not only the Console of Kangs, but Immortus, Rama Tut and so many other Kang versions!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Johathon Majors absolutely killed his role as Kang The Conqueror. The visuals were amazing and the movie was actually funny. It didn‚Äôt feel like they tried too hard to be funny. This was just an overall Fun and interesting movie. I also loved the Suits in this movie as well.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Let's start off with the positive. Kang was pretty good! Jonathan Majors was a good casting for the part and he played it well. The movie was also colorful and fun to look at at times. Now, on to the bad. This is without a doubt the worst movie the MCU has put out. By a lot. The dialogue was truly awful. The script was illogical, the jokes were not funny, there was no chemistry between between characters, Who in the world greenlit this script? I'm dumbfounded. Marvel should be embarrassed by this."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"the movie had its fair share of cringe moments but the performances of Jonathan Majors, Michelle Pfeiffer and Paul Rudd outshined them. Kang was scary af!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This is why i Stay away from critic reviews because clearly the audience has a different view when it comes to good movies. I have to say that i enjoyed this movie better then Thor love and thunder! 42% please!? Go watch it enjoy how fun it was to see Paul Rudd look menacing for a few minutes why fighting Kang and really earn his Avengers status this movie wasn't the MCU best but by far the worst either i will leave that to Thor 2! Still all these movies are enjoyable and great to watch with my kids !
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good and man movie the pacing was a problem but phase 5 is off to a good start and I can't wait to see what happens next for the langs and for the jang dynasty
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly I loved the movie but it could just be because I love AntMan. All jokes aside the whole movie was great from kang to the Cassie recast and the post credit scenes were amazing so definitely give it a watch at least once
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed Quantumania a lot! It started off bit slow but by the second act it found it's footing and when Kang shows up, it didn't slow down. I had more fun watching this than Love and Thunder and Wakanda Forever. Don't listen to the critics. There is a serious disconnct this time with them and the audience. Johnathan Majors is awesome as Kang. I can see where they're going with it. Start reading Hickman's Avengers/Secret Wars run. This Ant-Man gets a B+."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantum real scenes are a hallucinating, the criatures, the landscspes, the CGI was really good (something that Marvel was failing recently). The story has a weak point about motivations on some characters, but acting was really good; it felt so organic, specially Majors, Lang and Newton."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is really good, CGI improved, there are thrilling, action-packed and funny moments. I didn't watch most of the Phase 4 movies bc of the lack of plot and all comedy, but this new MCU movie is a shine of hope for what is coming to the Phase 5. Ant-Man is a great superhero!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not a masterpiece but a pleasure to watch. Great visuals and acting. Highlight of the movie is kang, Jonathan majors just nailed it. Let's not forget it's an antman movie not an avengers movie. So keep your expectations low and you will surely enjoy this one. Best way to start phase 5"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Ant-Man and The Wasp: QuantumMania"" may be the most simplistic Marvel Studios film ever.  Also, the closet in feel to a Marvel Comic single issue adapted to Live Action.  It's not without its flaws, but this film is less about character building (outside of the main villain) and more about a fun adventure."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a great kick-start to Marvels Phase 5, perfect balance of comedy and intense action scenes. Did an amazing job introducing and showing just how powerful Kang is and will be in the future phase 5 films."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This is everything I've been waiting for since Endgame. Majors is phenomenal and this film sets up everything to come.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie introduce new details and create the base for the new movies. It's funny and the actors make a great job.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing people saying it wasn't good aren't true marvel fans you don't expect so much action but this film had so much and so many good character development
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really loved how Johnathan Majors portrayed Kang
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although not the greatest entry in the MCU, the quantum realm made for a fun and interesting journey and Kang stole every scene."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,in this movie you clearly feel the tone and weight of kang presence which forces scott  into a more serious hero. he's no longer dealing with B or C class villians
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm pretty critical about movies I see. 
I was pretty disappointed. This is Marvel's Phase 5 kickoff and to me it was lackluster. Too much dependence on CGI, recasting Scott's daughter Cassie, forced humor, inconsistent editing, and lacking in emotional payoff are just a few problems I had. They are pushing quantity over quality. At least we have a general idea of who the big villain is after Thanos."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely love it! Jonathan Majors nailed it like he was born for that role. Fighting scenes are top notch and it made me feel like I wanna see it again. The mid credits scene are mind blowing and the end credits scene made me thirsty for more mcu series/movies.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Can't wait to see it again!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,The MCU really needs to go back to making movies like they did for the first three phases. This can just be skipped.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie of Antman, and great beginning of Phase 5. Better than all Phase 4, except Spider-Man."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie feels like it can show us more but they chose to cut many scenes otherwise it is good entertainer movie. If anyone is MCU fan they should watch this.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Favorite Marvel movie since Endgame! The critics are lame, go watch it and you be the judge!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not the best Marvel movie, but plenty entertaining. Good enough. "
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics. I throughly enjoyed this movie. It was fun, fast paced and had just the right amount of comedy. Kang is a great bad guy. Jonathan Majors nailed it!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought the movie was fun. It was a little slow at times and a little cornet with some dialogue but overall it was a good. Worth seeing in a good theater experience because the quantam realm cgi is awesome. 
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked this movie.  A little light on action, but not significantly light.  Had really cool visuals (some not as good).  Really liked that the movie contained world/story building regarding the Multiverse Saga.  Good humor.  Enjoyed how creative all the quantum realm characters are.  I personally would give it 85%."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If Jonathan Majors was not in this movie as Kang, Ant-Man and Wasp: Quantumania would be one of the most muddled, half-@$$ed, waste-of-time, bad-CGI-vomit movies Marvel has ever produced.  Totally unnecessary and irritating cameos that just eat up screen time and add zero to the plot.  God awful CGI for MODOK that's worse than what you normally see posted by amateurs on YouTube.  A Tron Legacy-esque rebellion that's pointless and adds almost nothing to the story.  Michelle Pfieffer just staring and not saying anything the roughly 10 times in the movie when she's asked by other characters (and on behalf of the audience) what the heck is going on.  Unexplained new tech.  Terrible, nor-funny jokes that no one in the audience laughed at.  Huge plot holes.  It goes on and on.  Disney is obviously just mass producing these movies as quickly and cheaply as possible now as soulless cash grabs.  But you should watch it.  Because despite all this, Jonathan Majors absolutely kills it as Kang."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I think the movie was really good it was visually stunning. Jonathan Majors is amazing. I think the movie was a sneak peek of Kang Power. The only problem is that they should have expanded on Cassie's character. Overall I'm excited about what is in store for us.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very slow. The story was lacking. The CGI looked rushed. It gave off cheap Star Wars vibes and Kang is a boring one-sided villain. Modok was ridiculous. There was a couple cheap laughs. Overall, just not worth the time or money."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is in fact THE BEST ANT-MAN MOVIE! It obviously isn't Endgame, and audience should stop over-expecting and just enjoy a good movie. I don't know what the critics had in their mind while reviewing it, but it is must-see. Some pacing issues here and there, and not so appealing sound track, but other than that everything else is great. No cringe humor, no overshadowing by family virtues (sorry Dom), this is what a non-cross over MCU movie is supposed to be like."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Majors and Pfeiffer delivered. Rest of the cast was just there. Movie failed to meet expectations for kicking off a new phase/era AND being a third in the series. At some points it felt like I was watching Avatar 3. This one goes into the pile of no need to watch again.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Please stop making horrible movies. 
I want to watch human beings"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Please do not pay attention to the critics rating (48%). I think they are taking things way too seriously and have an agenda. I am convinced these are individuals who deep down want to be the first to call an end to the Marvel winning streak. 
This is a good film that does exactly 'what it says on the tin'. I have read that the third act is quite busy but I observed it as being no different and just as hectic for the same act segment in the recent Avatar movie. 
Is Marvel offering anything new? No they are not, but first of all, this is an Ant-Man movie that is a little more serious and it is still a good night out."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was honestly an amazing movie. Great start to phase 5, idk why it has been getting so much hate. A specific one of the characters, however, had some pretty goofy looking CGI that made him more of a joke than a serious character. Other than that little nitpick, had me laughing a lot, and it was overall a really fun movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The way kang was introduced and their relation to the multiverse is just amazing
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was great! Jonathan Majors as Kang gave me shivers, what an actor! I liked the aproach on M.O.D.O.K., it is a silly concept and the only way it can work well is with some humor, even so the villain has a lot from his conterpart from the comics. 10/10"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I Enjoyed a lot, Modok was butchered, could be better, But was good."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania may not be the greatest Marvel movie ever made, but it's certainly not the worst. It has plenty of action and humour to keep viewers engaged and entertained. The special effects are impressive, and the plot is surprisingly intricate. Overall, it's an enjoyable watch for any fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Although some jokes failed to land most of the time, the tongue in cheek humor is quite entertaining. Especially when M.O.D.O.K. (Cory Stoll) is on screen delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie.

It can be hard to keep track of everything happening in the Quantum Realm, but that's part of the fun. There's always something new to see, and there's always something to explore.

Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer demand your attention every time they appear on screen, delighting fans of both actors with their captivating performances.

Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a decent movie. It has its flaws, but to say it's the worst Marvel movie is quite the stretch."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in with low expectations, and it was the best of the Antman trilogy.

On the VFX side, honestly, the entire sets to characters were an insane amount of variation that I could see $$$$ of investment & time. Could it be better? Sure, but the sheer amount of VFX in the film shows.  
If you have been watching the movies and the series on TV, you will enjoy this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is a good introduction movie for Kang, definitely worth seeing."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is a good movie, recommended for everyone."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jonathan Majors is the only thing that can be saved from another tiring movie of the Marvel formula
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics rate this movie wayyy to harshly. Its a good movie that doesn't suck too hard or does anything fantastic. The story worked, the characters were good, Kang standing out the most, I can't wait to see what they have in store for him later in Phase 5. Where the movie struggled a bit was in the CGI, but when the entire movie is in an alternate universe, the CGI is going to slip here and there. The pacing in the middle was little slow, but it ultimately picked up smoothly in the end. All in all, its a good movie and everyone should give it a watch."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Once you buy the premise of an inhabited quantum realm, the rest goes down easily.    This was a fun romp, perhaps a bit uneven on the opening third, but a solid finish.  The characters are engaging, even if the new Wasp gets a bit short-shrifted, but the family dynamics are great, Jonathan Majors is awesome as this variant of Kang, and anyone who doesn't like Paul Rudd is basically admitting they've given up on humanity.  Wacky fun.  Check your subatomic physics at the door and enjoy."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was quite good but cannot compare to other marvel movies
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the people giving it bad reviews don‚Äôt understand how comics work, or who kang is in the comics. For example phase 4 had a lot of movies and shows this was a lot of filler because of the blip people in that universe were gone for 5 years. Phase 4 was playing catch up, this is now phase 5 kang is here but he can move any time and any place, all the movies will be connected by the end but till we reach phase 6 it‚Äôs going to be hard to fallow and your average person today has a attention span of a goldfish. In all this movie was great, phase 5 is going to be awesome. "
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It‚Äôs the Thor: Ragnarok of the Ant-Man trilogy!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Better than what the critics are saying and it's a decent popcorn flick.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"La pel√≠cula tiene sus altos y bajos. Empezando con el CGI que nos tiene acostumbrado Marvel, en algunas escenas baja mucho la calidad, pero sostiene muy bien la pel√≠cula. La trama est√° muy bien explicada, claro con unos peque√±os agugeros en el gui√≥n, pero en general se siente natural. M.O.D.O.K ""buena presentaci√≥n"", luego de eso es un personaje vac√≠o, sin chiste, y para nada profundo. La Avispa (Evangeline Lilly) muy desaparecida en la pel√≠cula, no le hace justicia al t√≠tulo de la pel√≠cula, aunque ninguna queja de su actriz. Hablando de eso una de las mejores cosas que tiene este filme es su Reparto, Paul Rudd tan carism√°tico como siempre, Michael Douglas y Michellle Pfeiffer un gran duo, Evangeline Lilly quiero verla con m√°s protagonismo ya que su actuaci√≥n es incre√≠ble, Kathryn Newton es inspiradora, encantadora, seria lo mejor de no ser por el. Jonathan Majors es imponente en todo momento, le da un sentimiento a su personaje, que de analizarlo tendr√≠a que dedicarle un libro completo, nos dieron un villano que est√° a la altura de Thanos. Claramente este Kang no ser√° la gran amenaza, sino sus variantes. Una peque√±a gran pel√≠cula, entretenida, familiar, con un final demasiado feliz para m√≠ gusto, pero bueno. Y no s√© olviden... cuidado con el peque√±o!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Kang is going to be a good villain.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"a childish script with essentially portrays the next big bad as an imbecile, and our 'heroes' as people who eventually come on top because the Quantum Realm (for some reason) worked in their favour.  Something needs to change in the MCU because this is not working."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I didn't know what to expect going into the theatre. After the last of the credits and ""extras"" were done, I was left wanting more. I don't want to spoil anything. I hope you enjoy it more than I did. There certainly are some surprises in store for you!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-Man finally takes center stage as a serious super hero with extreme stakes. This movie had the most creative world building and character design I've ever seen and what really allowed them to pull it off was the franchise's sense of whimsy. The film both had high stakes and was hilarious. Paul Rudd and the rest of the cast were phenomenal and I am left with so many questions about Kang and the future of the MCU.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun movie to really set up Kang, not everything is Endgame but honestly critics were harsh on this one. Really enjoyed it."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"decent pass time 
kang was only best part in movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors makes an excellent Kang. Everyone on Team Antman/Wasp gets their moment on the screen which is often hard to balance in a movie and story. Saw the movie in 3D.  Great way to spend a day as fan, with a group or as family of all ages."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie! Knowing Scott Langs humor, I knew it would have silly jokes but sometimes it was too much and it got annoying. Loved the two end credit scenes."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a nice unpredictable story line, unlike the last few."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"These so called critics who gave this movie bad reviews had lost all credibility.  This movie was a great introduction to phase 5, an even better introduction to Kang. This movie was fun to watch.  If you go into looking for an avengers endgame level of movie, then you'll be disappointed. But if you go into it as a true marvel fan and understand that this isn't an avengers movie, you'll love every second of it!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great effects, Majors did a great job as Kang. Entertaining and worth watching with only a couple cringy jokes."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked this film. Phase 5 is off to a great start seeing ant-man again but in a new world with a new threat!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Was very SiFi rather than Avengers! Storyline was good.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie had a rough first act but after that this film became a masterpiece. Kang was one of the greatest villains of all time. The cgi was choppy in scenes but that's fine cause the other cgi was mind-blowing.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was hilarious and although it did feel a little rushed, the acting was great and I am still a diehard Scott Lang fan! It was overall a good movie to watch and had very wholesome moments! Plus Ryan Bergara made an appearance!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome start to phase 5! Johnathan Majors does a great job as Kang the Conquerer.   I was blown away by Michelle Pfeiffer's performance.  Loved seeing so much of the Quantumrealm.   While the Marvel movie recipe is the same and shouldn't change as it works, this movie was a refreshing new fast action pace, in another realm.   All hail the council of Kangs!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent story and plotting. Very cool visuals. Kang is a very, very compelling villain who is played exceedingly well by Jonathan Majors. I‚Äôve not seen that actor in anything else, but Im looking forward to seeing him as the overall antagonist for phases 5 and 6. The movie has a nice blend of action and humor. Could they have used Hope Van Dynemore? Yes. She‚Äôs more or less just along for the ride. But Cassie Lang shines as a spunky young hero and Janet Van Dyne is a major character throughout the movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not the greatest MCU movie but definitely not the worst.  Overall entertaining.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. Home run for Marvel.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Take the art exhibit Meow Wolf, toss in a bit of Star Wars, and add Marvel characters, plot points and the intro, and you have a close approximation of what the film was.
It wont be for everyone, but for those who are still invested in the MCU and want to see the best of Kang so far, this is a good time."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,it's a movie with a lot of flaws but not as bad as critics are saying it is. it's still a fun family flick and Majors as Kang is a stand out. 3.5/ 5.0
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was actually a good movie
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Somehow ruined Paul Rudd which I didn't think possible. Cassie is a total drag and feels forced. The movie is the most poorly edited film I've seen come out of Marvel Studios, and somehow the graphics keep getting worse and worse. And, of course they forced in some ""current day"" messaging which they can't seem to help themselves with. Read the room Disney. 

Majors changes the film when he's in it, which isn't long enough. Really disappointed - was hoping for an absolute banger to start Phase 5 and this completely missed the mark."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining and funny.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The CG was cheaply done that it disrespected the artwork of the great Jack Kirby, The acting was sub par except for that of Jonathan Majors who‚Äôs Representation of Kang was spot on accurate. Also the hints of social justice from Cassie and the lie of socialism was not needed! People go to the movies to escape life, not for it to be pushed onto them in entertainment. If this is the Beginning of Phase 5, Kevin Feige better start looking for a job under James Gunn!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the first marvel movie in a while where I didn't keep up with the spoilers & I'm so glad I didn't watch anything prior to seeing the movie. The quantum realm has been teased since the first movie so of course there's going to be a tone shift I was fully expecting that but it still wasn't totally out of left field so I'm not sure why people are complaining about that. World building was on another level this time I'm so excited for the future of Kang & Ant-man squaring off again in the future. Just overall a pleasant surprise I'd put it up there with multiverse of madness which I enjoyed quite a bit.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One word, Messy. Marvel has given up on any meaningful world building and nuance. I would imagine this was made by the same wrtting taltent of the film studios within the DPRK."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Starts rushed and a bit all over the place, but ends up being a funny and action packed movie. Some jokes didn't seem the land but a majority did. This movie in addition has a whole host of great characters and believable character arcs, and has a great side and main villain. One thing I can say about this film is that it's very much like starwars in the way how the other creatures and such are and how they react. In the end, it's definitely a flawed, but overall really fun movie that sets up the future of the MCU really well. Holes"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I understand some of the criticism of this film. But the critics score DOES NOT accurately reflect the quality of this MCU entry. Is it top tier Marvel? No. But it is by no means bottom tier either. While certainly a departure from the overall tone of the first two Ant-Man films, it is full of moments which make it feel right at home in the trilogy as well. It also provides crucial universal building plot points which have been lacking in the multiverse saga thus far. Overall, a solid entry in the MCU and nice kickoff to phase 5. Some folks just nitpick for the sake of nitpicking."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is maybe the worst mcu project of all time. This is the beginning of the end for marvel.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great start of phase 5, Kang is awesome. Acting is good and the CGI is better than Avatar!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Es entretenida. Me parece un buen inicio de la fase 5 y de la dinast√≠a de Kang.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing cast pulls it off well! The humor, I thought, was not distracting like usual. I went in expecting to groan a whole lot. But it was well used. Critics are just high off their own farts all the time. I'd even rank it above any Phase 4 movie. That's right, I said it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Literally don't listen to the 48%. It was so much better than the other projects that Marvel has put out recently. It's fun and honestly the plot is great. People expect to watch Endgame every time a new Marvel movie comes out. Quantumania actually made me excited for the next phase.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie start to finish, great special effects, and a good storyline. I will be seeing it again"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a comic book fan, I loved this movie. I felt it had a nice message and the story made sense to me. I think critics just want to whine about all the cgi but there's no way around that with the amount of stuff going on in the quantum realm. Paul Rudd is amazing as always and so is Johnathan Majors."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The film is not bad. It's a shame that the Villain was defeated very easily. But it's Kang. But he is good at that. It can be killed and revived a large number of times. But he is far from epic Thanos!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Johnathan Majors was a great villain in this. Has a wide range of depth that makes you sympathetic for his character early on. CGI effects in the Quantum Realm were fantastic.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It seems as if Disney went for the world record most amount of money given to special effects with zero dollars given to writers. I was a massive fan of the MCU and the comics. It really feels as if Disney is trying to kill the MCU. Not compelling, funny or cohesive. Modok was terrible, Ant Man's daughter was an awful addition, having geriatric Michelle Pfeifer and Michael Douglas as the frontrunners with as much or more screen time then Paul Rudd is atrocious. Their acting was nonexistent."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a fun movie, really makes the most of Paul Rudd. Post credits scenes are unreal and are for the fans."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"For a very ambitious film, the world building doesn't live up to the hype. It does get lost in the multitude of new characters, but ultimately still feels like an Ant-Man movie. Entertainingly weird, the film genuinely does not care about how odd it gets. While it does have a simple plot, the stakes do end up to begin to feel real. Incredible acting across the cast as the actors make more with their characters than the writers gave them. Very good job with the pacing as it's almost non-stop action which works well with the short run time. A definite shift in tone from the previous two entries, as this one is less witty and way more serious. In the end, the tonal shift works with the big plot and dangerous villain. Quantumania shoots the stars and almost makes it. Rating: 8 or 8.5/10"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The reviews out here are so bad...Like they forcefully want this movie to fail...And I don't understand why...This is absolutely the best ANT MAN film with Jonathan Majors with a MAJOR W! as KANG THE CONQUEROR. Don't look at the rating of these critics out there...They are BS.. But yes the movie is not perfect and I had my issues with it...But its nowhere bad as these people are making it. I would definitely recommend you to watch this as I am pretty sure you would get what this movie wants to deliver. A start to PHASE 5.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally, a good Marvel movie after all the bad ones we had these last years, including Black Panther.
I would have prefered a different end, with more details to what's coming, but it was a very good introduction to a new saga. Imo, better than what Captain America 1 introduced.
The only thing I didn't like was the CGI and humor on one of the surprise character"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film has interesting performances, fun resolutions, and tees off futurew stories very well."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Really mediocre, they forced a lot of jokes into scenes that didn‚Äôt really need them, the action wasn‚Äôt the best and a lot of important moments are  just cliches from other films, also the emotion it tries to have feels forced and artificial. Kang was cool tho."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,this movie doesn't amaze me but the comedy and cinematic experience is lovely would recommend it + the end credits are a must watch
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Quirky Sci-Fi from beginning to end!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome great special effects
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It's an amazing movie
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very funny, enjoyed it a lot, and the critics seem to have decided this is the time in the news cycle to be negative. In a year or so they'll write some stories about how the MCU has improved massively, and complain about the critics of this time, pretending that they're not the same people... GOTO 10."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie I was very disappointed
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great way to start phase 5. Watch the movie for yourself and don't rely on other people's reviews. They are skewed or DC fans. People seem to forget that these movies are not standalone movies and not every movie will be at endgame's level. Their expectations are way too high and wrong. Great movie!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw it yesterday day. And I can feel it even now. What a performance by all characters. But kang is not a character, emotion of so many hearts. Jonathan gave everything to kang. Its only kangmaniaüî•üî•. Kang kangüî•üî•"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Ignore the critics! Great film!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Do NOT listen to the crtics on this one. It was a VERY enjoyable film. Had some flaws as most movies do, but this movie was what movies are supposed to be, ENTERTAINING. Evryone is a critic now, do not let it drag your experience."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics, their relevance is over inflated"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Decent Marvel flick.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved this movie. Paul Rudd and Johnathan Majors were amazing together. So excited to see where the marvel timeline goes from here. I love how thought out and intertwined they have made the Marvel Universe. Would highly recommend this movie, will definitely watch it again when it gets to Disney Plus."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"By no means perfect but it's fun, there's a good setup and good world building, Jonathan Majors is amazing. It's really enjoyable, and they don't push too much in, it's never a labour. Good time, and that's all it needs to be :)"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really great film, i have no idea what the critics were watching but it cant have been what i just saw.
Great comedy but not OTT like Thor 4 was, great action sequences, some of the film settings made it feel like i was watching something truly epic like a star wars movie.
The CGI was much better than in Black Panther 2.
Overall id place on the scale of marvel movies somewhere at the bottom of the absolute best or among the best of the mid tier.
Cant wait to watch it again."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was okay. I expected too much after the stunning experience from Loki. But don't get me wrong, Jonathan Major did a fantastic job as Kang, love him. But the plot just doesn't seem that great. Also, weird they recast Cassie Lang but I think I like Kathryn Newton as Cassie.

But this isn't my final review. I may have a change of opinions after a re-watch once it comes out on Disney+."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Season 1 of Loki was enough to introduce Kang. No need for this ""Ant movie"". No story at all, I feel like I wasted my time. Popcorn was delicious though. The 3 stars belong to the post-credit II scene which was really good!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Interesting, fresh film with many novelties; the new world and its population is marvelous, and overall everithing has a refreshing and new vibe."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely doesn‚Äôt deserve some of the critic hate it‚Äôs been getting. Not the most perfect movie and some of the comedic scene could‚Äôve been done without. But it was a fun ride and I great introduction to phase 5.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was good, but not great. The acting was great, but the plot was somehow way too boring."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed the movie, evangeline and rudd are great can't wait to see more kang. I was laughing üòÉ"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was an amazing movie complete with cool effects interesting trama some fun moments an a new strong villain. Exciting for what is next. I don't really understand the last reviews from some people. What do they expect?. This has been a good movie from marvel like Spider-Man. So much better than Thor or Dr strange and wakanda forever.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you're looking for another nonsensical, terribly written story. Then step right up, we have more marvel poo to stuff down the consumers throats. The acting 2/10 the story 2/10 the cgi and visuals 7/10. Overall mood from the movie... I was bored, I chuckled a few times, I cringed for 75 percent of it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not in the upper echelon of Marvel films, but better than most of the TV shows and better than the reviews let on."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel is looking down on the audience
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a HUGE MCU fan, I'm not the kind to go into these movies to nit pick every detail. I simply go in looking to be entertained and entertained I was! This movie was a fun ride and it was interesting to encounter a whole new group of living beings in the Quantum Realm.  For me, this movie does a great job of mixing the usual Ant-Man wit while also establishing the threat that Kang will be going forward. Go into this movie looking for fun and you won't be disappointed."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Think the critics saw a different film
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent, I thought Kang was a great villain."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed very much. I wasn't disappointed at all.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just a big dumb fun marvel smash fighting movie. It is mostly CGI throughout the film. But if you go into the movie expecting this critically acclaimed acting performance then you will be disappointed. Fun movie that sets up the future of MCU
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was the story that was needed, to give more voice to Janet and her relevant place in the MCU. But like a few of the ensemble pieces Marvel has put out as of late, there's too much puff, non-necessary filler that doesn't move the plot. So the story was a little over-engineered and the whole suffered for it. Kang though, freaking epic!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This certainly wasn't the greatest movie ever, but it did what i believe it set out to do. The entire point for this was to be a setup for phase 5, it does that. And there's a ton of fun along the way."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I had a lot of fun with this movie! It‚Äôs definitely an Ant Man film. I think the critics are being way too harsh - and I wonder it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt get it? If you‚Äôve watched all of the MCU entries (including Disney+) then you will really enjoy this and understand what‚Äôs going on. Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors are really fantastic and I can‚Äôt wait to see more of Majors in the future.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fun and fantastic CGI. Well written and acted with less than the usual political preaching (the one exception being an awkward and obvious pitch for the failed ideology of socialism by a central character). Kang is a great antagonist and, although his character was introduced in the Loki TV series on Disney+, there‚Äôs no need to have seen that show to know all you need to know about him."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was a little apprehensive after reading the reviews, but reality trumps critique in this instance. It was a wild ride throughout. The effects were magnificent as usual. Janet van Dyne and Hank Pym were the unexpected heroes. Jonathan Majors was amazingly subtle at first and monstrous at last. Definitely a must see. Forget the reviews."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie! The critics are completely wrong! Go see it!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I‚Äôm afraid marvels glory days are behind them
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A bit different from the first two Ant-Man (& Wasp) installments (yet retains the heart and charm‚Ä¶especially Paul Rudd‚Äôs constant likability)‚Ä¶and has the needed sci-fi/fantasy escapism and popcorn action. Great cast and good chemistry with Rudd, Lily, Douglas, Pfieffer & newcomer, Newton."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Esse √© o filme q inicia a Fase 5 do UCM e com ele somos apresentados mais uma vez a Kang - O Conquistador, q j√° apareceu no fim da 1¬™ temporada de Loki, feito pelo msm ator Jonathan Majors, e √© um dos poucos pontos altos do filme. Quantumania n√£o chega a ser um filme t√£o ruim como t√£o falando, mas n√£o chega a ser melhor q os 2 primeiros filmes do Homem-Formiga q ainda eram da boa fase da Marvel. A Marvel nos cinemas t√° parecendo a maioria das s√©ries de TV em q at√© a 2¬™ ou 3¬™ temporada √© td hiper bem feito e amarradinho, a√≠ chega a 4¬™ temporada v√°rios atores saem, os roteiristas n√£o tem boas ideias e economizam o or√ßamento nos efeitos visuais. √â um come√ßo de fase morno e gen√©rico, por√©m os efeitos t√£o um pouco melhores, tirando apenas aquele tro√ßo bizarro q fizeram com o M.O.D.O.K., oh coisa mal feita. Tem 2 cenas p√≥s-cr√©ditos bem importantes, 1 pra toda Fase 5 e outra pra 2¬™ temporada do Loki."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely not as bad as people are saying. Although there is a lot of new stuff being thrown at you since it is building up to the next few movies. Paul Rudd was great as always. The recast for Cassie was fine too.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,For me the Best entry of Ant Man since the original
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely spectacular! The pinnacle of what marvel is, from the moment I sat down to the moment I got back up it felt like original marvel. This moves made me laugh and took me on a journey into the imagination which is the true intention of the MCU!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Saw this one in IMAX 3D. It was definitely shot and formatted for this type of display. Amazing visuals and a fun story.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,So the movie is the best Ant-Man movie in the trilogy! Ant-Man and the Wasp:Quantumania is not the best MCU movie but its not the worst! I love the relationship between Cassie and Scott plus this movie opens a whole new door in the MCU!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,A great way to kickstart Phase 5.....
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Bro got bodied by ants
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall a fun movie and I don‚Äôt quite understand some of the hate. Is this movie a top tier MCU movie. No, by no means is it up there with GotG or Infinity War, but it is nowhere near the bottom. I would safely put this in the upper middle. What is does do however is set up this phase perfectly. While the movie might not be top tier, Johnathan Majors is absolutely top tier. I could watch him play Kang (or variants) of him all day and am extremely excited for Majors to be the big bad of this phase. He seems so menacing and I understand and agree with Marvel saying he will be just as bad as Thanos. All the VFX teams shine in this and create a wonderful world and yes go see it in IMAX it was just a visual treat. One of the few times I‚Äôm looking forward to it being on Streaming so I can pause it and look at all the background details and character details because it does look like a lot of love was put into that. Does it have problems? Absolutely. A few jokes were meh but the vast majority of them give levity and, as an Ant-Man movie, it‚Äôs supposed to be more light hearted. I wasn‚Äôt too thrilled with MODOK but I think it‚Äôs because a giant head is just jarring and hard to look at so it creeps me out (much like the baby face in the sun on Teletubbies) Fortunately it is played for laughs a lot more and I really feel it had to be. The idea of a giant head cannot be taken seriously except in the pages of a comic. To me this isn‚Äôt a one and done viewing like Thor L&T and would gladly watch this again in theaters multiple times. Overall a fun, entertaining, escapist ride that makes me excited for the next MCU movie and that‚Äôs really what it‚Äôs supposed to do"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's hardly Shakespeare, in fact it has little emotional resonance, but it's mostly a lot of fun. There's a 10-15 min section in the middle which is exposition heavy and dragged, but other than that I really enjoyed the film.

Not the greatest MCU film - in fact not in the top ten MCU films, but definitely worth watching."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"With the introduction to an entire new world , the plot felt very rushed. & the acting during intense scenes were very subpar. The scenery +visual fx are top tier   but the movie doesn't feel believable."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was really good, I definitely recommend"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"So good. Seemed like they ran out of jokes towards the end, but Kang delivered!!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The visual effects are amazing and the new super villain is going to be a fun story to watch.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was entertaining felt just kinda useless at the end
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was fun and a great first step to Phase 5. Majors is a an absolute star bringing complexity and depth  to the role!  And of course Paul Rudd if just delightful, I mean can you really hate him in anything. M.O.D.O.K.!!!!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just out.

I'd read reviews of this film in the context of the marvel fatigue that seems to be a popular position with critics in the last couple of years.

Essentially, you'll find what you are looking for‚Ä¶

If you think marvel films have gone off the boil since end game (excluding no way home) you'll see that.

If you think marvel films are killing ‚Äòreal cinema', yeah you'll see that.

Etc‚Ä¶

Personally I thought it was great fun and it introduces Kang into the MCU beautifully (don't come at me with Loki comments, that's He Who Remains)"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie overall. Especially Major's performance. Wished it was a bit longer to expand the story.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Screw you critics its the best so far best ant man movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really fun movie. Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors, and Michelle Pfeifer are all terrific. I laughed out loud at several of the jokes, which hasn‚Äôt happened in an MCU movie in awhile. The movie is weird and not all of its moments are earned, but I was thoroughly entertained and will see it again."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Actually a great movie !!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie. it was hilarious
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best ant man movie I don't know why the critics hate this movie, I think that the people that don't like this movie just want to see marvel fail. This movie is so funny the Cassie/Scott scenes are so cool and Jonathan Majors ruled as Kang, so did the Kathrin Newton"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although it's not the same as previous Marvel phases and despite all the weirdness, this movie delivers what is intended in a typical Marvel's family movie package. I don't understand the hate about it, considering how worse were movies like Thor Love and Thunder. For a movie about Ant-Man, it's actually great"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,it was a great movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun sci-fi adventure that serves as a solid introduction for Marvel's next phase. Jonathan Majors owns every scene as Kang the Conqueror!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fun and really expanding and set up for the next phase of movies. I'm shocked this could have a bad rating.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena pel√≠cula aunque no era el final que esperaba y no me gust√≥ como muri√≥ kang por eso 4 estrellas pero la pel√≠cula cumple es una pel√≠cula m√°s de ant man y una introducci√≥n al villano casi perfecta...
Sin embargo la pel√≠cula cumple, es divertida con acci√≥n y fuerza muy recomendadaüëç"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"In fact, I think the whole thing is pretty good, the only thing is that Hope Van Dyne's hairstyle doesn't suit the actors at all and she has too little scenes in the movie.  But it really does a good job of showing us the Quantum Realm, and the kinship of the Ant's family.  Janet's performance is very eye-catching. Also, I would want more Kang, but I understand that they have to save them for future movies.  I think if most of the villians in the future movie will be Kang, it might start getting boring before the Kang Dynasty."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing and a fun thrill ride
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Muy mala, la trama forzada, kang es lo mejor de la pel√≠cula pero es mucho villano para ant man , si entretenida pero una decepci√≥n"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,It‚Äôs not a MODOK. But it‚Äôs not a Thanos either. 
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I could follow the story and loved the graphics
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Daddy DANG the Conqueror üí™üèæüò©ü•µ
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Safe movie to open Phase 5 MCU, moderate-high SFX, quite short with good content. Better than some MCU movies in 2022. Highly recommended"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman and The Wasp Quantumania is another good entry in the MCU. It was action packed, visually stunning (especially in IMAX), good BGM great acting by everyone (especially Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquerer), really good family dynamic and two awesome post credits. Kathryn Newton could have done better in the role of Cassie. The storyline was basic with a couple of small twists. I don't really feel that the film deserved a rating of 50%. Overall, this movie was indeed good and a great start for MCU Phase 5 and 6. My rating is 9/10."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a movie Full of action and some little weird jokes, like the others ant Man movies. But it's funny in the end of the day, Kang it's the better think in this movie, and set the pieces for the Future in the multiverse saga."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,it's a fun movie. I really loved it.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Major as Kang is great. That's all I can say for now...
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst MCU movies, I felt like a child wrote dialogs and plot"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,saw it last night. it really good not terrible like everyone made out to be. Their were some points that drag a bit but it is a pretty strong start to phase 5.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Just an absolutely fun movie. Aesthetically groundbreaking and tbh everyone was spot on‚ÄîKang is outstanding.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The story was good and Paul rudd was great
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was so good. Kang is so cool but they kinda nerf it and it's bad, CGI is fine im giving it 9.5/10 it was an awesome movie definitely a good start of Phase 5 I'm excited to see more of a Kang and Ant Man"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"So far, best movie in phase 4. Better than Love and Thunder and Wakanda forever. Glad I watched it in spite of the critics reviews."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"QuANTuMANia was amazing, Marvel hit it out of the park with this one"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Que filme ruim , est√° de m√£os dadas com Thor amor e trov√£o ."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Meh, not the best. Loved getting to see Scott again, and Hank had some cool moments. Honestly the second post credit scene was better than the entire movie. (We love you Tom!) I do like how they set up for kang though. But all the weird blue, green, and random cgi people in every single movie is getting old. We need another grounded movie, like the GOAT, Captain America and the Winter Soldier."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fue muy interesante la pelicula. No fue la mejor pero tampoco la peor. Lo volveria a ver.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie met expectations. It was funny enough to keep me laughing throughout. It had action scenes that kept me engaged. Most importantly it left me leaving wanting more Jonathan Majors Kang! Yes there were some things I questioned after the movie but overall, the criticism for this is way off. Don't expect Avengers: Endgame. This is still an Antman and Wasp movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No geral , √© mais um filme bob√£o da Marvel, o que salva √© a atua√ß√£o de Jhonatan majors como Kang, o conquistador"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' is a passable start to Phase 5 of the MCU, let down particularly by its underdeveloped aspects."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible visuals, sound design, score, and acting, except the main villain."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang has great potential in the MCU, Jonathan Majors absolutely killed it in this film."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is very funny and very entertaining, the villain looks very threatening and it had a very good ending, I will see it again"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the better phase 4 MCU entries and sets up phase 5 for tremendous success. Stunning visuals and fantastic insights into Kang moving forward.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,i still dont get why is this movie getting all this hate i loved it
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"O filme em si e divertidinho, por√©m o humor e muito bobo, o primeiro ato e uma bagun√ßa, os personagens s√£o planos, o roteiro √© f√°cil.
Se a Jenet tivesse ao menos conversado com a sua FILHA, o filme n√£o aconteceria.
A CGI est√° muito ruim, o filme n√£o consegue se levar√° a s√©rio, chega ser desrespeitoso aos personagens e f√£s.
As atua√ß√µes s√£o nota 10, principalmente do J. Majors, por√©m o kang foi subestimado pela Marvel,
Melhor cena do filme esta fora do filme.
N√£o passa de duas  estrelas e meia pra mim (o que salvou foi as atua√ß√µes)."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was great. Everything you would expect from an Ant-man movie. If you like Ant-man, you would like this movie. Really fun and really well done. I can't wait to see what marvel does next."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a great movie to see in 3D IMAX. I really don't know why these critics think that this movie should have been anything more then what it was. My family and I had a great time and everyone enjoyed it. Just go to have some fun.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining for a moment, but nothing at all like my experiences in the quantum world."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dull & redundant plot. Lack of build for main plot that surrounds the villain's background story. Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror was great! Wish they gave him more time to build up his story rather than being told by Janet.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not bad at all, one of the better movies of this phase"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is weird, entertaining, and fun. The hate feels so unwarranted at this point, and anyone who doesn‚Äôt like this movie likely has a dump in their pants. "
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought the movie was really good, though it seemed very short too me and things just happened too fast. I did watch a YouTube video and originally the film was supposed to be around 3 hours long. Overall I did enjoy it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's an excellent start to phase 5. It shows the construction of a new villain and a new context for the heroes are in the process of being evolution. It isn't an epic event, perhaps because it's not yet the time, it's a film that discovers new things, provides important clues and creates the foundations for, precisely, the epic evento."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"There was plenty of action, and the story had potential. Where the movie lost me was the end with the Kang variant. Don't want to give anything away, but what was the point??"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked the whole cast and while the setting wasn't as interesting as it could be I didn't have any issues with it - it made sense for where we are in the overarching universe. While I think Kang was a little mishandled, he's a super entertaining villain and Jonathan Mayors elevates all the scenes he's in. I liked the humor for the most part, but some gags particularly toward the end undermined the tension in a way that hurt my investment. I think some poor writing choices ultimately made me dislike the movie more than expected. I genuinely enjoyed about 80% of Quan-tumania but the final product is worse than the sum of its parts."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors was intense and magnetic! A great addition to the MCU's gallery of villains!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"THE BEST MOVIE, YOU NEED TO SEE IT!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was fun and entertaining. It was a really good beginning to Phase 5. Jonathan Majors was amazing.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Full action, some jokes are corny but it is for all ages"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Meh. Far too long with a weak plot and zero character building. There's very little of the humor and heart of the first film. And the CGI‚Ä¶awful. It's so clear that the entire thing was filmed on green screen. Half the time I thought it was a StarWars spinoff on Disney+.  Love Ant Man, didn't love this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eu amei o filme
Simplesmente t√° perfeito"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fits the MCU very well. Good action, funny where it needs to be, but not over the top like Thor. Much better than the critics give it credit for."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Paul Rudd yes. All of act two in the quantum universe, no, thank you. Hysterical. Pointless. Neither funny nor artful. A marvel studios needs way better scrips for these projects. This movie was a waste of time and junk."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's hard to review this movie, fell asleep multiple times. Also they went too hard with 'AI' designs, everything looked so random yet so unoriginal. Lol it was weird to see the really hood antagonist that's also in the next CREED movie act all scifiy."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics have a toxic relationship with Marvel lately and it shows in their reviews which aren't accurate. This movie was entertaining. It had wonderful visuals. The pace was wonderful and it kept me engaged throughout. Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Master's acting really stood out to me. Phase 5 is off to a great start and I can't wait to see more of Kang!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I had a great time! Jonathan Majors is absolutely outstanding!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie! I like how they kept the movie full of science and what can be. The comedy was perfectly distributed and was limited where needed to bring out the darkness of the movie. Thor Love and Thunder failed epically with this. There are a few actor spotlights I didn't think were perfect but overall an 4/5 stars for me. Kang sold his performance perfectly! Ant-man is a must watch movie!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The Best Ant-Man Movie!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great lots of action and the story line was even better! Cane will be my favorite character they always make the bad guy awesome....
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overhated movie cause it's marvel and everyone hates marvel. Great casting and a great comic accurate portrayal of MODOK. I swear people just hate to hate. Cgi was also decent, few rough scenes but great overall."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great movie from Marvel !
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was great! The visuals were amazing üëè
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Just a mid movie. Nothing special.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantamania created a fresh, fast paced world of action, heroes and unique villains that kept me entertained in a glorious 3D IMAX movie. Not really sure what some of these critics were expecting."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Film diverte e le due ore non pesano,  Kang di Jonathan Majors mi √® piaciuto molto , anche se forse poteva essere sfruttato un po' meglio,  le due scene dopo i titoli di coda sono fondamentali per il futuro , non parliamo di un capolavoro a i suoi grandi difetti, per√≤ io la reputo un buona partenza"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This Movie üçø is really amazing üòç‚ù§Ô∏è love it üíû
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Did the critics and me watch the same movie ? It had some issues overall a very good movie. I like the way Paul carried the role, and the quantum realm environment building was pretty solid. Only downside I felt was the way they handled MODOK and the first post credit scene."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watched it tonight with my partner and totally loved it!! We weren't expecting too much from the critic reviews but it's actually entertaining, re-watchable and made us super hyped for MCU again! Can't wait for Kang Dynasty"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. Fun. A lot going on, but you also see how things get set up for the next MCU phase."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very enjoyable film. Kang is going to be awesome in the MCU
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, gorgeous visuals, good humuor and not as bad as critics were thinking. I loved the movie except for the end which could have been better in my opinion. Overall we couldn't get bored throughout the movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun, exciting and entertaining movie. It's not as good as No Way Home but it's way better than other low-rated marvel movies. Like Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness, there was a character that was pointless and stupid. It is a solid movie and nothing more and nothing less. To watch it you have to have seen the other Ant Man movies as well as the TV show Loki. Defiantly recommend to anyone who wants to watch a great marvel movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics are coming down on this movie way too much. It's a fantastic watch and Kang is a terrifying and menacing villain. Go watch this movie!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining, lots of laughs, exciting setup, and a nice dose of heart.  I felt this movie was really good and quite the SciFi rollercoaster ride."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, brilliant villain."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this movie, but the first half is very silly, and the humor just didn't land with me. I enjoyed the Kang story and how he had a history with Janet. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily are great, but the story ends with almost no consequences for our heroes. I'm sure future movies will continue on this, but it doesn't help this movie's enjoyability. I'm not one to buy into the ""Marvel is failing"" argument, but this movie made me feel that more than ever."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I had really high expectations for this movie I thought it was going to be insane. They underpowered Kang so much. Kang is not him. Someone should've died by Kang in this Movie BUT NOBODY DID! Kang was getting bitched around a lot during the movie.  I don't know how the hell Kang was beaten by fucking Ants that shit was sad. The only really good fight scene with Kang is at the end whens he's beating the shit out of Scott. Hope and Janet did a really great job   In the movie. I got nothing bad to say about them. Cassie didn't really show any emotion in this movie. Some of the scenes with her were kind of meh. Hank wasn't as good as the previous movies but regardless he was good. I was pretty disappointed at the end credits but always stick around for them if you're a true marvel fan. The movie was still pretty alright. It was still pretty entertaining. It just didn't live up to what I expected‚Ä¶ Solid 6-7/10 for me, you pick the number."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Entretenida sin muchas pretensiones, presentaci√≥n de Kang m√°s que aceptable. Me sobran cosas como MODOK y el personaje de Bill Murray pero lo peor es la actuaci√≥n de la nueva Cassie Lang, la actriz es sosa a m√°s no poder, el cambio de cast con respecto a End Game le ha sentado bastante mal.
Con todo esto en contra, la pel√≠cula es bastante mejor que su predecesora y sirve como introducci√≥n de fase y presentaci√≥n del villano que nos espera."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In questo film non c'√® nulla di Antman, nulla di quello che lo aveva reso amabile e diverso dagl'altri super eroi. La CGI √® insopportabile, livelli bassi e troppa troppa troppa. Inoltre ho avuto l'ennesima conferma che la Marvel non sa scrivere i personaggi femminili, o sono delle rompic****ni allucinanti o sono anonime. Che delusione."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania just delivered a very strong villain who is going to wreak havoc on the multiverse. Jonathan Majors slays as Kang. The movie is good with great visuals and the cast does a great job. The story is not perfect but it's a close second. Totally hyped for KANG DYNASTY!!! 

P.S.: Go watch the movie and make your own conclusions rather than relying on critics."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang is excellent as the new big baddie.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As of right now this movie is getting way to much hate. The MCU has been on a streak of mediocre and just bad movies in general, this is the first movie that definitely brought me back to loving the MCU in a great new way"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this film was amazing and better than I thought
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Antman 3 is a good movie, but it is flawed.I love the ideas that are in the movie and most of all I and loved Kang.this movie has a tone balance, not a great one but there is one.compared to thor love and thunder.I wished it was easily the best one of the trylogi, but it is better than 2 [in my opinion] and it was easily the largest in scale.not bad, but wish it was better.overall (7/10),"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie! Jonathan Majors obviously did a fantastic job, but so did the rest of the cast, especially Michelle Pfeiffer. This movie never forgets it's an Ant-Man movie & also isn't afraid to get weird. Even the quantum realm species are given enough time that when the climax of the movie unfolds you care about what happens to them. I could literally watch a Disney+ show just exploring life in the quantum realm. The people in my theatre applauded at the end of the movie so it shows how captivating this movie was. Absolutely loved this movie! I hope the MCU continues to give us stories that aren't afraid to be different & explore areas of comics that we not only never ever thought would be in the silver screen but is still connected to the other dozens of projects in its multiverse!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, well put together . Interested in seeing how the rest of the upincoming films work out"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun marvel adventure that does not over stay is welcome. Kang is fantastic. Saw it imax, which seriously helped the experience."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Another middle of the road marvel movie. Throughout most of the movie it was pretty solid. Kang is a cool villain obviously. Acting was good enough, storyline was actually really good. The ending ruined it for me. Disney seems to becoming too safe and trying to please everyone at the end of their movies. Not every movie needs to have a massive ‚ÄúSave the Main Heroes‚Äù ending where a massive army out of nowhere saves them. Would‚Äôve been a 4-4.5 stars with a better ending but Midvel strikes again"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie critics are dumb and not give the faire reviwe of this movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,So many good parts you just have to see it
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Movie is Good Enough. It's just the starting of a great dynasty. Overall it's a great movie but sometimes it felt like something is off in this movie. Character development for the new characters could have been better and the ending should have been a bit more interesting. But overall it's a great movie to watch, the humour is amazing and Jonathan Majors nailed it as Kang the conqueror."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this movie way more than I expected too. It was funny there was plenty of action Jonathan Majors was stunning and I wasn't in the theater for 3 hours. I only wish I had more popcorn. It was a great time at the movies. I will be seeing it again
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A 2 hour and 5 minute teaser for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. This does not work as an Ant-Man movie: It's the least funny and charming installment of this trilogy. Also, the action sequences are incredibly boring because their choreography and direction are lazy and rushed. This is one of the worst MCU films ever made,"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Left room for character development, very entertaining and left the theatre with high hopes for the future of the MCU"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Me encant√≥ la pel√≠cula, el √∫nico fallo que le v√≠ fue M.O.D.O.K. que me hubiera gustado sea mejor tratado en cuanto a car√°cter y bueno Kang es espl√©ndido, ya quiero verlo de nuevo a√∫n m√°s villano en Avengers: Kang Dinasty... Los efectos, Ant man como tal, todo excelente, volver√≠a a verla üòÅ"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"the movie was entertaining, and I really enjoyed Jonathan Majors as Kang. I felt as if there were a few plot points that were missing, but overall, I enjoyed the movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"While not a perfect movie, it was thoroughly entertaining. Jonathan Majors as Kang was fantastic (except maybe in the post credits scene where his acting could have been improved). Overall, it‚Äôs an Ant-Man movie. It‚Äôs going to have some jokes where it should be more serious but you know that going in. Sit back and enjoy the ride."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't let the so called ""critics"" scare you as this one...  This is a solid Marvel movie.  Lots of fun from beginning to the end with lots of action throughout.  A nice balance of comedy and drama sets up so much moving forward in the MCU. Johnathan Majors absolute kills it as Kang.  My family thoroughly enjoyed it opening night as well as a packed audience who left the theater very happy."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too many characters, too much going on and the final battle scene looked too familiar"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie to kick off Phase 5! The stakes were high, there was tension and jokes were not overdone but used here and there in the way we know and love it from the MCU! Additionally, the CGI improved a lot by what we've seen last in phase 4.
What I loved most about the movie was the connectivity to the greater picture of the multiverse saga by referencing previous issues like the incursions that we got to know in MoM or the timelines and variants that we know from Loki. 
Jonathan Mayors is absolutely great and brutal as Kang and Paul Rudd and the others did a great job portraying their characters as always. Katherine Newton is a great addition as the new Cassie and I loved seeing her use her powers for the first time. And Modok was just a super funny addition, as well!
All in all the movie is not your typical Ant-Man movie as it is of course not a heist and is of real importance to the story going forward. I enjoyed it a lot and cannot wait to see how phase 5 continues!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a great movie .With less humour than other antman movies. Jonathan Majors killed the role of Kang. I would definitely recommend it.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a great movie .. love it
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It had a the classic mix of humor, drama and spectacle that we've come to expect from MCU movies. This might have been a better Star Wars movie than the last 3 Star Wars movies. The main cast all shined brightly, especially Jonathan Majors as Kang. 

I've always enjoyed the family elements of the Ant-Man movies and the characters trying to do the right thing. This theme was even stronger in this film. 

We are also set up for a pretty terrifying future which was really satisfying to see. 

I wonder truly if critics are even trying these days. It seems they just want to rain on the parade and hope you do too, which is weird. This isn't high cinema folks."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The main reason to watch this movie is for some comedic relief brought to you by, Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors killing it at his role  of Kang. 
Majors steals the show and makes us excited to see more of this villain and great acting by him.
Much better than the last few marvel movies but I hated that 4 ant-men/women beat Kang. That was total bs and do not believable."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"decent movie. typically comical as expected of an ant man film , but there was definitely a seriousness at times."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Most definitely my favorite marvel film out of the last 3 to 4. Modok and Kang were so justice. Johnathan Majors really chews up some scenes.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nunca hab√≠a puesto una cr√≠tica a una peli pero est√° me ha parecido tan mala que he tenido que crear una cuenta para decirlo, nonla quiero volver a ver jam√°s"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed it.  The humour was good and not overdone.  The stakes felt high enough and the ending was really good.  Sets up the Kang Saga really well. Reminded of me of Rick and Morty. I enjoyed that
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely one of the more polarizing movies in the MCU. A fun watch with major implications. The CGI is spotty at times, but the story line of the movie makes up for it. Also Jonathan Majors is absolutely brilliant."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,When you conquer the multiverse and lose to a fucking  ant man
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie had a great storyline. I believe if people would separate themselves from Endgame and a few previous movies, they could enjoy this movie a bit more. Infinity War, Endgame and a few others setup unrealistic expectations for future Marvel series motion pictures. The acting was great. There was action, comedy, romance, and no typical Disney ""agenda"". What more could one ask for in a comic book film?"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Was great entry to phase 5. Alot of critics are burned out on comic movies but comic fans will love this story. Keep at it marvel üëè
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, Jonathan killed it.Critics can suc mai dic"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is amazing,all the critic low reviews come from people who have never kept up with a marvel or dc movie in their life and just want an oversimplified one time movie,but this one you gotta know what happened before to understand and thats what urks them to review it so low.Don't trust the critics,the movie is awwsome,recommend watching it"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed the movie, very funny and kang was great"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Marvel is coming back
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A Good Superhero movie with an amazing antagonist in Kang who does the best. The movie falls off the cliff with its writing at some points and the fact that all we were expecting out of kang was to become the next big bad of marvel. Sometimes funny, sometimes fun, sometimes cringe and sometimes too much stupidity, overall a mix bag of a movie if your a die hard fan."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is the first time I have ever agreed with critics. It was disappointing. Best part was it was only 2hr long. What happen MCU
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is extremely dumb and the script was written by a 5 year old. Once again, Marvel is sending us more sludge with the same ridiculous tropes you'd expect: comical jokes when people are dying, a super smart child who jumpstarts the plot of the film, and no important characters dying because that would be too sad. There's also the stupid memory store thing that happens again, which is just horrendous. Michael Pena does not return, making one of the only jokes that landed in the first 2 Ant Man movies to not return for this one. Most people are giving positive reviews on this movie to spite critics but basically this is Marvel at its worst."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A family movie across the Quantum realm. Fun in all accounts and really sets the stage for the future movies. Marvel fans should watch it and ignore the critics.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This is Perfect Starting For Phase 5 Actually I Love This Movie Previous Ant-Man Movies is Funny but This Movie is Totally Action i love Action scenes And i love The VFX it's Great Phase 5 Movie so don't believe Negative Review Go watch the Movie You Guy will Loved üêúüí•üí•üñ§‚ù§Ô∏è
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pacing was off, sound design and music was either non-existent or completely forgettable, story beats move blandly from one moment to the next, Bill Murray's character was a passing nuisance and ineffective in bringing anything to the movie apart from ticking a Marvel comic-fan's checklist of cameo appearances.
Jonathan Major is great, but his performance suffers from the lousy ""climax"" of Giant Ant Deus Ex Machina Marvel Studios likes to write into their movies now, instead to fall neatly into the 2hr+ feature film formula, left Kang's first silver screen appearance woefully lackluster as a whole.
One final saving grace for Kang is his variants are abundant and hopefully more interesting in future feature films or series, which frankly speaking this movie serves only to push the overarching story forward, and nothing more.
2nd Worst MCU movie I've watched apart from Thor4 which is a bloody mess I couldn't even bother to finish watching."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie. Another MCU banger.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"My thoughts about phase 3 was perhaps I am growing old. Perhaps we are not the target market anymore. But the ""introduction"" of Kang was not entirely perfect, yet it was exciting. This movie took me back to the first Guardians of the Galaxy. None of other Marvel movies managed to do so. It's definitely not my favorite Marvel movie, but definitely one of the joyful ones. Strong performances from the actors kept it engaging throughout. Kang will return."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,greatttttttttttttttt
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,More Marvel eye candy for the sheep to gobble up. Seems phase 5 is picking up where phase 4 left off. Disney definitely needs to slow the amount of Marvel content being churned out and concentrate on quality.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It should have been called ""Ant Man's daughter featuring family."" She had as much screen time as Ant man and was often placed in the center screen or ahead of him. But why? She has the dull face of Kristen Stewart and adds nothing to the movie. The Wasp was barely in it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"While critics continue to spout their negatively, audiences agree that this movie is not only a great start to Phase 5 of the MCU, once again most critics don't understand current modern day cinema"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The moive was class grate comedy moments action was amazing disappointment that the post credit scenes was short the council of kans was predictable. And missing Louise but all aside amazing moive gona see it again
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not a 10/10 but a solid ,fun ,enjoyable movie. Well worth a trip to the cinema."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I felt that this was way better than Wakanda Forever and doesn't deserve the bad ratings.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a solid MCU film. Kang, the whole Antman family are great. 

Only real complaints were moments of, ""did we really need that ‚Äòfunny thing'?"" We play the pronoun game for a bit too long -meaning a lot of references to ""him"" as if no one on the planet ever saw a trailer for this movie. One villain role was completely unnecessary and they should have cut it completely. Cassie has great moments and moments where you really have to suspend all your common sense - every kid is a super genius and equally preachy thing is a bit tiresome but overall enjoyable.  Jonathan Majors is a great actor for his role and I'm looking forward to seeing him more after this movie. Loved Douglas and Pfeiffer."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While the visuals were great and there was a lot of good parts, a lot of the story and plot was absolutely horrendous, MODOKS entire character line and ""arc"" being the most insulting part to marvel fans as well. It's incoherent to the story and feels just so odd and like they added him in there for fun. Marvel also is losing its touch, constant long pauses between fights, villian and hero standing face to face and having whole monologues and unneeded lines before fighting. It's getting too predictable, too boring. Kangs fight scenes all though cool could've been way more fleshed out, I really wanted to see the full power of Kang! But this movie held back on Kangs power so much and it's so dissapointing, because the conqueror has such a cool backstory, that just doesn't add up nor make sense in the end. The story is horrendous in the matter of, some characters actions make absolutely no sense to the movie, nor what there goals are. Also there's no Luis or the three wombats, that alone makes this a two star mess. Only thing that makes this film redeemable is the two post credit scenes"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Must see for any marvel fan
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"E a Marvel segue com uma incr√≠vel sequ√™ncia de filmes fracos. Piadas for√ßadas, roteiro cheio de pontas soltas soltas, final clich√™. O que salva, em parte, √© o vil√£o. Por v√°rias vezes fiquei esperando aparecer um Jedai nas cenas, uma vez que cen√°rio parecia ser um aproveitamento dos filmes do star wars. A Trama n√£o acrescenta em nada no universo UCM."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Took in ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA earlier today in IMAX-3D (I couldn't resist the irony). Marvel Studio's has another hit. Everything about the film is superb: story, production, acting, visuals, stunts and music. The plot is timed perfectly and mixes in humor just where and when you want it. Michelle Pfeiffer is radiant and portrays her character's emotional journal with ease. Mike Douglas' comedic skills are a wonderful balance in the film. Paul Rudd is at the top of his game. And Jonathan Majors' depths are astonishing and will clearly be on display throughout Phase V & VI. The rest of the cast are stellar as well. Worth the price of a second ticket."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie as a whole was enjoyable although unlike the past 2 movies I did find that there were large sections of the movie were I was starting to become bored. However there scenes only took up about 20 to 25minutes of the film and as a whole the majority had me hooked. Overall it was still on the better side of the marvel films and Johnathen Majors really stole the film when he was on screen, along with the 2 incredible post credit scenes this is a must watch for any marvel fan and a very fun and enjoyable watch for anyone else."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. The themes really represented what the movie truly was
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, better than the last few marvel movies, plus Paul is hilarious üòÇ"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Beats phase 4 at least
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"An amazing Antman film. Paul Rudd plays his fun and tiny hero so well. Special effects are amazing and well executed. 
This film is Antmans biggest affect on the whole Marvel pipeline and it does it so well. Being serious but also keeping it fun, weird and humorous 
Kang has an amazing introduction as the strong, overpowering conqueror he is and proves to be one of the biggest challenges for Scott Lang
Wish we got to see more of Bill Murray though"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"So start for the beginning it takes us to the adventure of quantum realm. The critic's were wrong about the movie as it has comedy, adventure, goosebumps moment, suprise,crazy action.the seriousness it builds after the first half is on another level, once again endgame vibes in the climax (watch it to know it).With some loop holes like the Kang character was not that level as it was hyped+ the Bgm was not that good. VFX+CGI were great ."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a good movie with good plot and acting. Also there is very good sense of humor and everything just was great!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just liked the movie. It doesn't have any really touching moments, but the plot was just good. Finally Ant Man lived to see a good villain, maybe you can feel some insufficiency when it comes to Kang, but let's remember that this is just the beginning. A good opening to Phase 5."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolutely great action-packed Marvel movie that includes many of our characters that we have seen and new characters that emerge into the Phase 5, including Ant-Man, Hope Van Dyne a.k.a. The Wasp, Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne and last but not least our new hero Cassie Lang. We also see Kang the Conqueror as our new villain for Phase 5. An awesome movie that is great to watch and also very important for future movies such as The Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and The Avengers: Secret Wars in 2025. Would highly recommend watching this movie for both MCU watchers and absolute fans!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I actually enjoyed this movie. I personally thought that the cgi was great and the acting. I can't understand why people are mad ?
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it! The chemistry between Scott and Cassie is real. Perfect
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love love love Antman 3 Quantumania. I NEVER trust ball sucking Youtubers and critics,, especially Grace Randolph."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie truly seemed to be at its core a way to build up hype for kang and the eventual movie, Kang Dynasty. The movie doesn't shy away from the Kang heavy story in its middle and third act. It does however take time in the opening section to hide Kang from the viewers and in return heighten stakes, here's an example. Showing us M.O.D.O.K , who almost kills the heroes. The suspense is deepened when Kang easily flings M.O.D.O.K aside. The movie is unafraid to share Kang's power and the power balance is skewed. The eventual defeat of Kang is admittedly the wrong path to go down I think. It would've made more sense for the Avenger killer to get away scratched rather than to maybe be dead. Either way the movie is funny, comedy has always been a selling point in the Ant-Man films and is at its height in this movie. Characters feel rushed and Cassie, Scot and Janet (at least to me) can come off as annoying due to varying factors. 

Cassie: Never listens to adults or anything they have to say.

Janet: Under no circumstances can she actually tell anybody whats going on which makes her more annoying, rather than draw out suspense this kills it.

Scott: The writers can't decide if he should be a genius or idiot.

Overall I enjoyed the movie but it can be lost on those who haven't caught up with phase 4 (a phase which I am proud to say I liked for the most part). Loki season 1, Avengers Endgame and Ant-Man 1 & 2 and required viewing for this movie to make complete sense to viewers."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is so ridiculous and no sense.  Apart from how much they talk, just talking and talking, the multiverse and the quantum world they have already become exhausting.  boring, without any sense and without going anywhere. My son just fell asleep. In the movie a teenager just creates a machine so easy and a lot of other things that already went too far. 

To be honest I prefer the absolutely no sense of fast and furious that at least is good and nice that watch another boring and Just talking from marvel."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, lots of fun. I hope there's a fourth.  I don't understand the negative reviews"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Once again, the critics are way off on their rating. This movie was a fun, entertaining ride throughout. If you liked the humor/style in the first two, you'll like this one too. Agree that it's the best thing from Marvel since No way Home. With that said, not perfect/wish some things were different, but still entertaining and one I may watch again."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While although what they end up doing towards the end of the movie with Kang wasn‚Äôt what I was hoping for, the movie is still a solid MCU movie! Nothing ground breaking but something you could easily enjoy when you have the free time to go see it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie, yes the cgi was a bit dodgy but people are just finding reasons to hate on movies more so if you're wanna watch it go ahead I say. Don't let other peoples reviews stop you from enjoying your movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie sets up the future of MCU but as an individual story it's not that great. The storyline is too obvious and no elements of suprise & twist. From acting point of view the movie looses its string on emotional pov, especially the father - daughter chemistry of Scott & Cassy. Acting of Jonathan Majors is on point, just what you expect from a such high profile actor.

The world building of Quantum realm is gorgeous. Good camera work & direction. The action scenes are good but the side characters are got shadowed.

Overall an one time watch. The movie has 2 post credit scenes and both are important for future."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie overall would see it again
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"No movie is perfect. It also has minor flaws but that can be overlooked by it's awesomeness.Overall it is very enjoyable and best ant-man movie.[Not a time 
or money waste movie]"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed Antman and the Wasp Quantumania. Ild be honest was quite wary considering it would be CGI heavy but it looked great. 

Kang and his variants are going to be a great villain going forward. 

Ps. The cut of the film could have been a little bit better, a few scenes could have been fleshed out ever so slightly. 

And modok. Not sure if I'm impressed or disappointed ü§£"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the movie it was quite enjoyable
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, different, great action, good story 
Johnathan majors as Kang was fantastic"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was definitely better than Multiverse of Madness. I don't get why it has almost the same rating as Ethernals bc that movie was complete garbage. This was just a typical Ant-Man movie, not the greatest but fun to watch with great visuals and some funny jokes."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not the best entry in the MCU, but not even close to the worst.  Funny without being ridiculous, excellent performances, and some very smart moments, this was worth seeing. Should have an 80%."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I see too many people overthinking about great plans and design of this and other fictional universes. I went to theater trying to let apart all the stuff on the media and trying to be as naive as a little kid going to the movies. The film is fun. It delivers. Great science-fiction adventure in a strange world. A canvas of colours and textures. An enormous villain that made you hold your breath when he was on screen. Marvel films are not dead. They are still alive and strong.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is a complete non-sense, visually not that impressive wrt the liberties the scenario offers, even humor is not quite good...
One of the worse Marvel's I've seen so far..."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In this movie they talk about ""time"" a lot bit after leaving the cinema I felt like a wasted 2 hours of my time . 

It was a royal mess and a disappointing start to Phase 5 of the MCU. 

They tried to go BIG but it failed . Would have been better if it was a more grounded family movie focusing on regular life. 

The acting was all over the place however Janet and Kang are probably the best, Ant Man comes in close behind, he is just a fun character and the rest being Cassie and Hope could even have been cut from this movie. They added very little and had very flat and uninteresting acting expressions through the movie.  I even forgot about Hank as he was just like a confused old man forced to tag along with the kids. 

The VFX and 3D at times was almost nausea inducing, not sure if the Quantum realm made it seem that way but it almost gives you a headache. 

Kang as an Avengers Level threat was seriously nerfed in this movie, Jonathan was great for the role but the Directors and Script did him dirty here. He deserved his own series as a introduction with back story but was wasted here. A lot of what they do in this movie leaves you scratching your head in confusion. 

Overall the movie had a fair amount of action and entertainment,  it wasn't boring but it didn't do anything to make you go wow, this is great. This was all over the place, lacked heart and was just a mess. 

Could of been a streaming movie 

Rating 5/10"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I found it very enjoyable. Had some great funny moments and the visuals/special effects were amazing. Can't wait to see more of Cassie and Kang.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Finally got to see the quantum realm and the back story of Janet Van Dyne. Scott and Hope are finally officially a thing.  Kangs backstory and setup for his future variants was written so well, can't wait to see more of Kang. Let's not forget MODOK, small role, but was funny as heck. Hopefully, we'll see an Antman and The Wasp sequel rather than later."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,dont know what the hell critics were rating so much low. i pretty much enjoyed the movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I feel like this movie is just about the perfect way to start off phase 5. As a film, it‚Äôs mid. I would say trash, but I‚Äôm biased for marvel so that‚Äôs why my rating is pretty high. You will get an amazing time at the theaters though. I love this movie. It lived up to hype ( for me at least ). And I suggest it for any marvel fans. It gets me so excited for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The cons, when it went from scene to scene, it made like a huge jump to something that had almost nothing to do with the previous scene. It seems like marvel only filmed the scenes that were needed for future projects to make sense. No extra effort in putting in extra filler scenes to help the flow of the film. Also M.O.D.O.K felt kinda wasted, he wasn‚Äôt really written as a character to be taken seriously. Kang was amazing of course. I wish there were more scenes of Casey alone, and more scenes of Ant Man and the Wasp together since the movie is called Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania. I don‚Äôt think there was anything that didn‚Äôt feel needed, there was only stuff that should have been added. Other than those cons, I really enjoyed this film. Can‚Äôt wait for everything else. Oh and the CGI was soo goood!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Honestly stereotypical marvel film. More interested in how the movie affects the marvel universe. Plot, characters and fighting were all predictable and lackluster. Wasn‚Äôt the worst marvel movie but definitely not the best."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie has funny bits but there‚Äôs no story arc that I found interesting to follow
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was such good movie and everything About it was great action special effects and funny
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this movie. Fun and exciting. Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors are fantastic. Kang owns every scene he is in. Can't wait to see how the Multiverse Saga plays out. Finally excited about the MCU again!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As everyone says already, Jonathan Major's Kang shines in this installment of the marvel franchise. Yet the very obvious marvel/star wars formula makes it somewhat dull as the film goes on. It still brings the fun&action that we all like, so overall not a bad viewing experience!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It lacked any essence or character. The cgi did not transport the audience to a sci-fi world, despite all the effort to be atmospheric. Performances were okay but the writing was extremely lazy and disconnected. It was not boring but the movie could not decide if it was a juvenile comedy or sci-fi adventure. Terrible."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are in any way a fan of comic book lore, this movie is 100% on point. Kang and the quantum realm is exactly what you'd hope marvel would make of them - 0 issues with the portrayal of characters. This movie alone blows out avatar. üíØ highly recommend. Critics sadly don't know anything about these movies."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"SEM SPOILERS - Filme leve e bom de se assistir. N√£o entendi o ""hate"" da galera at√© agora. Pra mim o melhor filme da trilogia do Formiga. Um bom filme dentro da proposta dele. At√© o cgi que estava bem cagado nas √∫ltimas produ√ß√µes da Marvel, est√° muito bom, tirando uma cena ou outra. Logicamente t√™m alguns pontos negativos, mas tudo de novo que nos trouxe e apresentou para in√≠cio dessa fase 5 da Marvel foi t√£o maravilhoso, que faz os pontos negativos n√£o serem t√£o importantes assim. E o que falar do Kang. O conquistador est√° incr√≠vel. Jonathan Majors fez um trabalho espetacular para a primeira apari√ß√£o do vil√£o nas telonas e as cenas p√≥s cr√©ditos s√≥ nos fazem ansiar muito pelos pr√≥ximos encontros. Entendo quem n√£o gostou, mas definitivamente n√£o √© uma porcaria de filme como a maioria da cr√≠tica especializada est√° pintando ou o pior filme do MCU como est√£o ""hateando"" pela net."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The visual effects were amazing, the quantum relam was exactly what we needed to see, kanga storey was great and he was an amazing character.   Where marvel are starting to fall down on is the comedy.  They try to throw in too much funny jokes, and silly things and don't take it serious.  Kang is supposed to be this big bad guy, but I felt he was overshadowed by all this humour around him.   Modok never needed to be in the movie and served no purpose, feels like he was put in just because marvel need to show him somewhere. 

If marvel want to see kang and his varients worse than thanos, they need to start making movies like iron man, winter soldier, civil war.  Gritty, action packed, less humour and seriousness.

I was disappointed with last night's kick off to phase 5, but I trust the process and hope the other movies can more serious like endgame, infinity war."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very good and entertaining movie, but honestly I was expecting it to be better."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The Worst Marvel film I have ever seen. Boring, lacking real action. And too much of a starwars rip off"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wouldn't say this is bad cause for something to be bad you have to actually care and go somewhere with your film. This is just a nothing burger. 

And oh boy, that firtt post-credit scene really feels like the death of the MCU is near..."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"the movie is a good time especially for an antman movie.
the story is great, the acting works, the jokes are expected.
Kang stands out and the post credit scenes are brilliant.
The future looks bright for the MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun and awesome movie and Kang was amazing just movie needed more Kang and his power of strength!!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Visually it was good but this movie could have been skipped for starters this was supposed to be marvel not a star wars film
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Even though the movie had action. It felt slow paced almost boring?
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's better than the reviews say for me. It sets us up for an amazing phase 5.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"much better than the previous two film. MCU have it list of bad movies, and Quantumania definetely not on it. so enjoyable and visualy stunning."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Marvel has lost it's grip and cannot awe you anymore.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had a good time with this film. Beautiful skyboxes, Rudd being funny, Lilly being sexy. Majors as Kang is vicious and terrifying, Ant Man really makes the hero turn in this film leading into Phase 5 and 6, with guest appearances by Stinger and M.O.D.O.K.. Really has a 5-8 issue comic book arc feel, jumping right into the action, while managing to do a lot of world building. 
9.5/10 for me 
""It's never too late to stop being a dick."" -Cassie Lang"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Everyone in the theater enjoyed it. Fk the critics
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,A messy story with yet more of the phase four bad writing and jokes that don't hit. it's meh at best.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was absolutely incredible!!! I have no idea what the so called critic's were watching but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie start to finish. As a lifelong comic reader and actual comic book fan this movie was exactly what I love about comics. I don't know if people have become so jaded in today's world and society that they just want to stomp out any joy and entertainment for anyone else because such poor reviews make zero sense to me. I will be watching this multiple times and definitely the best Ant-Man movie to date!!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,The plot is not good but the special effects are great
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably one of the best man movie's
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"F‚Ä¶ the critics this movie is an absolut top tier MCU movie. It felt like a lapse 3 movie and yes Luis should have appeared (the jokes in general could have been better) and ant man should have lost more, but all in all it is a must see!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was two different movies.

One half was really dumb and felt like a really expensive kids movie. Whereas, the other half felt like a spectacular superhero movie that reintroduced a very intense and awesome villain who I am very excited to see more of.

I'm no fan of plots that are based on the mistakes of a naive teenage character and it really seems like Marvel is making that their main theme. Also, I'm no fan of the idea that there will be 'Young Avengers' because so far it'll be full of stupid kids. Same goes for the idea that all the Avengers are now celebrities, it's all very meta.

Ever since the underrated and great Ant-Man (2015), the movies in this trilogy have gotten dumber. To the point where science is just a joke and not even explained in the film, it's just things that happen. It's left Hank Pym being quite a simple character and not as mysterious and brilliant as he was in the first film.

Now for the good bit. As soon as Kang came on the screen, the entire feel of the movie changed. Jonathan Majors brought this intensity and power to the screen which elevated Paul Rudd's performance too. I really cannot wait to see more of him. That last post credits scene is what got everyone clapping and cheering so do wait for the end.

The visuals were incredible, probably the best it's been for Marvel but it's hard to measure, but this was all totally original visuals. It was what Multiverse of Madness should've looked like. It actually was gorgeous and it made some brilliant scenes. The overworked visual effects artists definitely did a great job on this one.

There were some pointless secondary characters who had little explanation for why they were there. And they wasted the return of an old villain for something really dumb. It's like they had a really good serious movie but the recent theme with Marvel has been that they squeeze in silly childish bits in between to make the parents happy. They've forgotten it's the adult superfans who pay and will repeat watch.

This movie showed signs of the old Marvel that was wonderful and showed signs of the new Marvel which I'm very scared about."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It didn't have a positive effect with a cowardly script. Jonathan Majors is amazing even with a script that doesn't exist, he's a spectacular actor."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't care about MCU anymore. I was hoping that this movie will set MCU back on the track, cause from End Game to now it's a downhill. Unfortunately Ant Man don't change anything. Good job Disney; you killed Star Wars so hard that I almost didn't watch Andor (Best Star Wars thing in recent year) because I had no hope. Now it's pretty much the same thing with MCU‚Ä¶.."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Don't listen the the critics. This is a very enjoyable movie. Kang is absolutely amazing. This is a great introduction to Kang, and his Dynasty!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Full time entertainment & fun a lot
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is great. I enjoyed the movie much. It was not boring. We can predict upcoming movies from this movie. And kang was mind blowing. Overall this movie is great
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hit on some bigger questions. 

Better than Captain Marvel"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand why this is getting so much hate? This movie is an amazing start to Phase 5. 
It has the funny style that you'd expect for a antman movie but Jonathan Majors sets the tone for how serious Kang is.
 If you were hoping to see how dangerous Kang is, this movie will more than satisfy for marvel fans. It's an amazing movie to finish Antman's trilogy. 
For being the first film of phase 5, it truly showcases what the future holds and will leave you more than exciting for it to come. 
Only thing I'm upset about is having to wait till 2025 for Avenger's Kang Dynasty because this movie will leave you wanting more Kang."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I do think that this movie is great!¬†
It‚Äôs a fun movie but the first 30 minutes were messy but after the first 30 minutes it does get better. I do think that this was better than Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) but it‚Äôs no where close to being better than Ant-Man (2015).¬†
Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror was terrifying and I loved it! M.O.D.O.K was an ok villain.I thought Kathryn Newton did an amazing job as Cassie Lang.She was one of the best characters in the movie other than Kang. The final act was my favorite part of the film cause it gets super intense.
¬†The ending was great.
There are 2 post credit scenes and they are both hype!¬†
I‚Äôm giving this film an 8.7/10 it‚Äôs a fun movie great start for Phase 5 
edit: I do think its better a second watch"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the most thrilling and fun ant man movie to date. The humor is perfect and majors' performance as kang is incredible. It's a shame that critics graded this film negatively, as if they're smarter than everyone‚Ä¶üòí"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I love when the daughter said... Daddy!!!... hahaha...
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another great feel good, fun marvel movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing..!!! Must watch.... The best Marvel movie of Phase 5..!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics don't do this movie justice.  The comedy hits the spot while the overall tine is carried by Kang.  Definitely worth watching.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"First act was a little slow, found myself getting impatient waiting for Kang. Movie ramps up after and post credit scenes set the scene for future MCU projects"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie for the ones with MCU experience
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, it was an amazing movie, i wud give it an 8/10. I personally enjoyed it and for those complaining abt kang being weak, well that wasnt even the main kang. Cant wait to see how the upcoming movies play"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a way to kick off phase 5, the way the film links with Shang chi, ms marvel and Loki is great and only true marvel fans would see and understand the ways it links. Brilliant film all round."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked the movie, the visuals were great, it's a very nice opening for a new phase of the avengers"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie, maybe because I had heard so many bad things I came in with low expectations, but it was great"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was the best marvel movie after Avengers Endgame & Avengers Infinity War. A great thriller ‚ù§Ô∏è. Enjoyed every bit of it üî•
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,More Kang please. Love the movie
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie's overall is alright. It introduces a new realm which explains it. It gives an idea on what marvel wants for kang and the other series/marvel to come. Although I'm not a fan of the film score. there is no connection of the sound to the scenes and it made it confusing. Lets not forget the other characters close to ant-man.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another movie with low stakes, bad cgi, undermined characters within a small cast and dull plot and character development. A movie that advertises action and comedy yet neither exist or land."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie is really awesome , awesome fighting sequel and i really enjoying this movie a lot ,  awesome fighting ant man vs Kang . Everyone should watch this movie really awesome .and cgi is good and editing is awesome . Really awesome movie üçøüçø"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,More entertaining than last year's MCU offerings.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie! So much fun to watch
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is amazing. Fighting sequences are awesome. Post Credit scenes tease a lot. Don't miss them.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Meh‚Ä¶ Blockbuster escapism. Could have toyed around with history a bit. Now that would be fun.ü•≥
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,i think it's good to see
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie was quite enjoyable. First act starts with a fast pace but it was still fun to see what these characters have been up to since endgame. Johnathon Majors absolutely kills it as Kang. Although movie was fun some characters didn't quite have the same charm that they had in the previous movies. Towards the end the movie struggles to find its overall tone. Post credits scene are worth the watch!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think in our generation, movie critics have finally lost touch with moviegoers completely. It feels like the priority of this film wasn't to make something people will forever study for its deep writing and metaphor - it's an Ant-Man movie for goodness sake. This movie was made to be fun, action packed funny and to do a great job at introducing the MCU's baddest villain yet in a satisfying way. All in all, this movie is for the fans of Marvel comics and movies, not for the snobby critics who think everything needs to be pushing some kind of societal message or meaning beyond the source material. Highly recommend for comic book/action/sci-fi fans."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was different but I enjoy it .. it was fun and kang was killer! Definitely gotta see it in the theaters
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an absolute blast of a superhero movie! It's filled to the brim with humor, action, and an incredible cast that will leave you with a smile on your face from start to finish. Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man, is back and he's better than ever before. He's settled down with his wife and daughter, and they're living a normal life until his daughter, Hope, makes some scientific bumbles that put their family and the multiverse in jeopardy.

But don't worry, because the heroes in this film are like ants, they never give up! The film takes inspiration from these little creatures and showcases the importance of persistence and determination, making for some truly epic action scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat. And the visual effects are 10,000% over the top, adding to the excitement and adventure of the film.

But be careful, because the flashing lights in some scenes might make you want to dance like an ant! It's important to note that they may pose a risk for viewers with epilepsy or sensitivity to light, so take appropriate measures before watching the film.

Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a happy-go-lucky, action-packed ride that will leave you with a huge smile on your face. It's a must-watch for any superhero and science fiction fan, and I guarantee you'll have an absolute blast watching it. Five out of five stars, all the way!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,the movie is ok but kang stole the show. this movie is like a character that is miss cast in his own movie. none of the charm from ant man 1 and 2 is in this movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Big smiles and exciting action throughout!  Great 3rd act to the Ant-Man/Wasp franchise.  Super happy viewing opening night and love the Ant-Man popcorn tub we got! OH! Jonathan Majors was AMAZING!  This is a complex character that is very compelling, and he portraits Kang so well!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. Scott Lang played another great movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie has gotta be the best of the series by far. The movie truly was an Avengers level event that did not disappoint.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel left nothing on the table, it was all there.  KANG means business, who do we turn to now."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang stoles the movie. Cgi is good. It takes a good start for phase 5
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"MODOK, Rules baby, collecting comics since 1969, so I was wondering if they could pull this off, and they did, and everyone else was amazing too, so what if its CGI crazy, its work it, Kang best Villan since Darth Vader, nuff said!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie reminded me of WonderWoman1984, a not-so-good movie that you should see, perhaps only because of the performance by the villain. Majors as Kang compared to Pedro Pascal as Maxwell. 
I'm poking fun but the dialogue is rough in Antman, specifically the scenes that michelle pfeiffer led. There's plenty of action in this movie and I really enjoyed those scenes. The world building in this movie was also somewhat good or atleast on par with expectations. I liked the background/side characters introduced. Cassie's dialogue comes off very rough especially in emotional scenes. Paul Rudd doesn't have much chemistry with his grown up daughter. In fact chemistry in this family or team, is shaky all around. There's a lot of humor in this movie that works for me. Also how they chose to portray Kang, and show his powers was very fun to see. The ending of the movie had a couple of good twists, but there were a few parts that i felt didn't work. I come away thinking about things i wanted to see differently, but also having appreciation for some of the interesting Quantum history discussed and the introduction of Kang. I'd watch it again because of the fun action scenes, but make no mistake, this movie has problems."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun movie and I love it!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I didn't get to watch it bc they said my ticket wasn't good no more all because I went outside real quick
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Uma perda de tempo, o que acontece no filme n√£o tem consequ√™ncias no UCM, filme sem sentido de existir, muito infantil, esse filme foi rasgar dinheiro e tempo."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, visually amazing, and I liked what they did to set up future movies. Plus, Bill Murray. It was a great movie for date night and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the MCU, but also people who are just wanting to watch a solid movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought I was going to be really disappointed after the review on this site and some farts on british bullshit corporation...

Luckily trusted my instincts and went ahead and watched it. Thoroughly entertaining and exactly what I expected. Keeps the charm but also explores new worlds and gives more insight into KANG. Majors hammed it up for the ending with the 'Council of Kangs' but other than that --- no complains at all...

Also they should let Majors be physical - that was brutal. 

Story - wise,this was way more interesting and appealing than Avatar 2"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"FU*k rotten tomatoes it was a great movie as a marvel fan it was a great movie overall.. if you are a marvel fan u can't miss this film as it was the starting of kang dynasty I am not going to spoil the movie but it was awesome!!! I will give 8 out of 10 . And if you are going to watch the movie don't forget to watch the post credit scenes otherwise u will regret it, there are 2 post credit scenes. And I can u will scream after watching the 2nd one ‚Ä¶ LOVED THE POST CREDIT SCENES!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"is good more star wars then marvel, bit too long but Kang does make his name known"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie. it's Ant-Man, no more needs to be said."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was great! Some of the CGI could have been better and the comic fans might be a little mad at the portrayal of a specific character but overall it was a very funny and enjoyable movie. Of all the new movies marvel has released this one felt the closest to being something OG fans could recognize. Definitely a good watch!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie is very good the plot its great and the characters are also great !
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm going to tell you guys this since we are in 2023 Phase 5 has just begun!! as a Marvel nerd and a fanatic you guys better buckle up strap in and hold on tight this movie was amazing!!

I ADVISE EVERYONE TO STAY IN YOUR DAMN SEATS AND WAIT FOR THE TWO END CREDITS TO THIS MOVIE I'M NOT DOING NO SPOILERS THAT'S YOUR LITTLE SECRET FOR ANT-MAN QUANTUM MANIA IT'S AMAZING
I'm going to have to go see it two more times cuz I think I missed a couple Easter eggs but this is something pretty amazing!! Jonathan majors played his part as KANG tremendously.
hope you guys enjoy it."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not that bad, but not that good either. But a superb performance for Jonathan Majors, and a great introduction to Kang."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,great cinematography
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is everything you would expect in a Marvel movie. It puts you in the action right away and it offers spectacular visuals. The plot was very well written and it obviously had a lot of jokes, some you are not expecting. Jonathan Majors is incredible as Kang and Rudd is hilarious. Yes, you could've changed a few parts to make the movie ‚Äòperfect' but this is a solid B tier movie from Marvel.

Also, two amazing, must see end credits scenes

Overall grade: 8.8/10"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very disappointing ending for sure, not what I was expecting."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie has its flaws, but overall is consistent in delivering good action scenes, and funny and diverse characters. 

Kang totally balances the comic parts of the movie with his rage and impulsive moments.

The CGI is good for the majority of the movie.

It's a solid beginning for phase five of the MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really good! Glad I didn't let the critic reviews spoil it for me
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is different than the other two ant-man films but unique in it's way in delivering this intense story of Kang the Conqueror. It has a good balance of comedy while delivering a much more tense story arc for Scott and his family. This film does keep you wondering what's next for the Avengers as it sets up the next big bad of the MCU and brings this Multiverse saga to a close end.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Really no idea what the critics issue is on this one. Excellent movie and sets up a lot going forward
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Good performance by Jonathan majors but Kang is shown extremely weak. The movie has many shifts in tone which don't work well and the start wasn't very captivating. MODOK was a character with huge potential that marvel simply wasted.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang Bang Fifty Shades of Kang etc
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually brilliant. Lots of ‚Äòsafe the day at the last minute' moments and a great bad guy. A couple of end credit scenes with one in particular setting up exiting things to come.

MCU on top form."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie. Ye it's not perfect but as a Marvel fan it is the movie I wanted. My biggest complain is that Scot should have died and Kang should have survived (as he is the one king that could be the main threat in Kang dynasty.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was excited for this movie, I really was. The plot felt like a setup to Avengers rather than an Antman movie. The movie consisted of plot armor which would be fine if done correctly however, in this case it felt as if there was no effort in the climax of the movie. Visual effects were average at best which doesn't make sense considering the budget. Johnathon Major's performance was very solid however and is a great villain. However, the potential was wasted. Overall 3.6/10 and not worth the watch."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Cool movie really enjoyed it with my wife.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a pretty good film it was funny like first two Antman movies but this one had better fight scenes and the quantum realm cgi looked amazing overall kang and Antman went crazy!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Epic, fun and absolutely original art design. Kang is a beast.

In the context of the MCU, revealing and trascending."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are obviously mad about Marvel's success and are purposely trying to destroy this movie. I saw it last night and it was fantastic. Excellent pacing. Great humor. Great action. Great villain. Paul Rudd was amazing as always. There is almost nothing not to like. Stop worrying if you're a fan. Go see it‚Ä¶twice.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant movie. The critics definitely flubbed their ratings on this one. Quantumania is full of action and heart, with gorgeous visuals, moments of hilarity, and lots of action. Jonathan Majors, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Kathryn Newton knocked it out of the park, and this film does a great job setting up the rest of the MCU Phase 5 and the Multiverse Saga to come."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly don't know why some people hate it. For me, it was a really good movie. I liked the final fight against Kang. Because it shows that even if he fought many heroes in other universes there's always something to surprise him. Don't know why but for me awesome opening for phase 5"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a good setup for phase 5, Jonathan Majors shows an amazing performance as kang the conqueror!! I understand people were upset with how the antman trilogy concluded but this will not be the last antman movie and this was meant to setup the big events to come. It did lack some charm and comedy that was shown greatly in the previous films, but then again this isnt the end for our shrinking family and I believe we will see them kick ass once again but even bolder than shown is this film."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was very different than the previous two and it wasn't one I felt matched the topic of the other two. Some of the comedy was missing due to some actors who weren't in this movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Interesting start, nothing happens in the middle, some certified marvel idiotic humor then a bunch of ants come and save the day through the power of socialism and time contrivancies. Phase 4 was too preaching and directionless, phase 5 starts just as plain boring."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was fun. A bit too silly at times. Jonathan Majors was incredible as Kang
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It is a terrible way to kick off the Phase 5 of MCU.

It's Bad, Dumb, looks Cheap and has some of the Worst Action sequences of the entire MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mcu keep on messing up this movies up, what a horrible way to introduce a main villain. They made Kang look beatable right away. This company is just trying to milk out the Disney plus shows by doing this disaster on the theater. Very predictable movie don't recommend watching"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun comic movies full of Jack Kirby visuals
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is so fun and wondrous!! Kang and Janet were amazing!! Definitle something to look forward to
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Feel like it‚Äôs overhated it really isn‚Äôt that bad and it‚Äôs pretty watchable 
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Huge bounce back from marve
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not the best Marvel movie but something that was certainly enjoyable the whole way through. For me, the MCU has been lacking lately and to begin phase 5 with something fun but also setting things up for the future was a good decision. The only issues I had were the portrayal of M.O.D.O.K and perhaps forced comedy at times (but that's the MCU nowadays). All the actors did a good job in this movie from Paul Rudd's Ant-Man to Jonathan Majors Kang the conqueror."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is Perfect
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun film. Great visuals with solid acting from the cast. MCU did a great job of starting MCU Phase 5.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Very satisfying and can‚Äôt wait for more Kang!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was absolutely STELLAR!!   Great actors the lot of em'
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Some faults but not the worst
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,good except for the bighead dude
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Many gratuitous action sequences that did not advance the plot, overused tropes, and predictable dialogue."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it!
Maximum Marvel grooviness!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Not perfect but a lot going on behind the scenes but now that a change has been made now things should be high in quality. But I don't know if it's a huge push somewhere in the movie world to trash superhero movies and create a false narrative about superhero fatigue. I never heard of something so stupid that's like saying I am tired of action movies or comedies. I just think some film makers are jealous of all of the attention superhero movies attract. So all of the negative reviews don't surprise me because success always attract hate. But this movie is not my favorite MCU movie but it's a great addition and something fresh and new and great cgi. I don't know what they complaining about that because I don't know where a real quantum realm where they can film real scenes at. I mean it's call Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Im glad the movie had quality CGI. The MCU should be commended for creating a world like the Quantum Realm with CGI technology. It's a beautiful watch. I give the movie a 8 out of 10. But everyone has a right to there opinions.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in with low expectations because of Thor: Love and Thunder l and Doctor Strange: MoM. It was better than both of those movies, and while flawed, is a fun start to phase 5. The plot armor trope continues, expect heavy CGI and a movie that makes you think of a Guardians of the Galaxy/Attack of the Clones hybrid in the visual regard. Characters are 1 dimensional ish, the movie could have been an hour longer and I think that extra time could have worked in its favor."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"After the hot mess that was Thor and the drawn out and underwhelming Black Panther, Payton Reed manages to build on his two previous outing and deliver a solid and quirky end to his ant man trilogy.... The last few marvel villains have been held back by unconvincing redemption arcs, but  Johnathan Majors put in a solid performance as the franchises new major threat. Still plenty of laugh out loud moments - and bucking the recent trend Cassie Lang does not feel like shes been shoehorned into the plot. The only thing missing was any chemistry between Scott and Hope... perhaps the marvel franchise has not run out of steam as reported.."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not even a mediocre mess, really disappointing. It should have been good, but it seemed like CG quality was prioritized over story."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not the strongest MCU film, but there are moments that personslly I feel are peak MCU that elevate it to a bit of a higher level than the overall relatively average, almost lack luster film.

Paul Rudd continues to be charming and really just the perfect Scott Lang, and the new edition of Cassie really wasn't too bad. Kang stole the show, as expected, Majors is just knocking this out of the park, I'm so excited to see more. Biggest gripe is MODOK, but not how he looks, (personally I like the mask, and the awful face CGI is forgivable, I mean look at the comic and please tell me how they could make that look any better..), but it's actually his arc in this film. What a corny and awful way to end it, it feels like the character was just wasted. 

While it doesn't have the best story telling, it does the job a comic movie is supposed to do, it entertains, and ultimately I just hope to see more Antman.

My percentage score is around 68%, but with the stars I'm nit gonna penalize and round down as I feel that's too harsh for this particular movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Seriously don't mind what others think. Get yourself to experience at theater and feel it. Phase 4 is kinda mess in overall but antman really focus on their story and shows its unique story. Crazy tech but not on some nano tech shits, instead we see the power of ant!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie lacked the spectacle and levity of the previous installments, but was a solid comic book movie, and last a good foundation for Phase 5. I've seen criticism that Kang and Scott didn't work as enemy/hero, but I don't know if kang and Scott were a mismatch, or if that was intentionally the point. Like they're in entirely different playing fields to show we are heading towards scary times in the MCU. The movie left me optimistic about the tone of phase 5. Like I think the tone was a necessary adjustment to hopefully have the whole phase work together.  I'm excited to see where the MCU goes from here. 
Side note-I also enjoyed when Kang beat the shit out of Scott. I like when the movies lean into the vulnerability of the heroes.  And Kang is an awesome villain in all his iterations.
Second side note-was anyone else bothered by the visuals? Some of the scenes felt too bright and hard to watch, and the world-building felt uninspiring in the quantum realm."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,awesome....  I was entertained!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed this movie. It felt a little different for Ant-man as visually the movie feels like a cross between Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy. 

The positives were Jonathan Majors performance, the brilliance of Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas; Paul Rudd is charming as always. Visual effects were great too (minus M.O.D.O.K). Storyline was pretty decent, as was the cameo by an all time legend. 

The negatives, Just don't think Evangeline Lilly is a good enough actress and she barely gets any dialogue in here anyway, she wouldn't have been missed if she wasn't there. Unfortunately, there was no chemistry between Paul Rudd & Kathryn Newton so I struggled to care about their relationship, compared to the previous ‚ÄòCassies'. As this is quite fundemental to the storyline, it felt like there wasn't much heart in the movie vs other Marvel outings. 

Spoiler alert!


There was no Luis!! They should have managed a small scene or end credit at least."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't see review its good movie just watch it and decide it
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Was waiting for it to be over for most of the film.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining but no depth...does not develop the quantum realm, nor focus enough on character development. Does little to move the arc of the series."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,quANTuMANia was a solid first installment for Marvel's Phase 5. It stayed true to the cook-iness of the previous two Ant-man movies while creating a whole new playground for the characters to play in. The only reason I am not giving this five stars is for one missing character who left a Giant-man size whole in the movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,It offers nothing but bordem
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie felt rushed and incomplete. The saving grace of this film was of course Kang. Sloppy storyline, sloppy acting from Cassie‚Äôs actress and overall confusing."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love antman he is one of my favorite marvel characters! The movie had amazing graphics and visial scenes. The movie was well made and set up future projects for marvel which is why I love these movies. Many people say that Phase 4 or 5 movies aren‚Äôt good, but it‚Äôs only because they have such high expectations because of infinity war and endgame. The movies are still quality movies."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfect?! No.. but good enough for a phase 5 starter.
Don't listen to the sleazy critics, this film is quite enjoyable."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,If you've seen all the films and Disney+ shows you'll love it!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I legitimately don't understand all the hate. I thought it was definitely better than most of phase 4. A good time
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad in storytelling and building characters, the only thing of this movie worth watching is the acting of Johnathan Majors. How come the Kang in this movie be that weak?"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awsome movie , very good and griping story and also a good ending and the best part was the post credit scene was awsome"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Do not listen to other people's opinions or even this one to go watch the film. Go watch it and see if you enjoy it or not. Personally, I thought it was a really great movie and it perfectly got me hyped for the future! The humor was on point and everything looked amazing."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Another fun Ant-Man movie. Lots of heart. Loved the Star Wars vibes. Looking forward to the Kang Dynasty and the Young Avengers.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Felt off and not right.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very entertaining. Good set up for what's to come. Visually amazing.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's purely my opinion.. 
I've watched this movie yesterday and i liked it. I'll start with negatives - The story wasn't great at all and felt like they have rushed the movie as the running time was low and the movie was fast paced . I felt like they needed to increase length and improve the story and some characters role felt weak and could have been improved. CGI was ok not bad, but still it could have also been improved for a movie with total CGI. 
Positives - Kang was literally lit. He is just awesome and his backstory was also good but i could have been elaborated a bit. 
Paul Rudd as always was too good. His humour and his acting was great as always and worked out. There are some funny moments which i really enjoyed. The mid credit scene and post credit scenes really hyped me up ."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Es una pel√≠cula mal√≠sima!! Aburrida, los efectos especiales son del a√±o 2000, los villanos son muy desperdiciados. La ni√±a se muestra m√°s lista que todos como en muchas pel√≠culas de Marvel, demasiadas cosas ilogicas, personajes molestos. Un gui√≥n bastante est√∫pido. En MCU est√° Muerto! Si Disney sigue as√≠ se ir√° a la bancarrota."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"4.5/5 Honestly it was a decent start / set up for phase 5 and should be treated that way. NOT as a stand alone film, because if you treat marvel movies that way of course they will be bad, because there will be no ending. I loved the visuals of the movie + the atmosphere. For the biggest issue that I have brought up was MODOK, people saying he looks like Mr electric from shark boy and lava girl... Well they are right he looks like a joke, acts like a joke and you know what I think maybe its just because the wrote him that way, AS A JOKE CHARATER. People just need to remember that its main audience is children. ""pre teen"" So when the writers make a small villain a joke that SHOULD NOT bring the entire film down."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Build up to a larger plot. Definitely better than Thor love and thunder
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too bad, I didn't expect to die so easily."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Don‚Äôt listen to the critics movie was amazing.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best antman movie ever they came up with
Cgi was on point it wasn't bad like we saw in thor love and thunder and dr strange MWOM
How they incorporated Modok was incredible"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The story incredible awesome. I totally live how Kang 1st introduce in MCU and hope to see his appearance in future film. The end battle have similar tones as Endgames.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,So excited to see the future for kang
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is overhyped, as a die hard marvel fan of the mcu and comics, this movie did not hit the homerun i had expected, BUT, the film is still enjoyable, slow start, mid finale, GiAntman is a bonus everytime, Johnathan Majors as Kang is great, thats really about it though."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is a perfect set up for Kang Dynasty, the visuals were insane and the action scenes are fire. Don't listen to what are critics is saying. It doesn't deserve the hate."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the movie was really good, I do agree that it was a fast pace movie but it was fine. The comedy was really just great!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was fire. Loved it a lot
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Inconsequential film with a story that seems to go nowhere. Seriously, is this ""the phase 5""?"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great beginning to the multiverse! Super fun, amazing special effects and Jonathan Majors is just phenomenal as KANG!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Original storyline, amazing graphics, and the 3D didnt make me sick!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow! The visuals and sound make this a must see movie in the theatres!! Kang is one of my favourite MCU villains!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Doesnt meet the full epicness of previous Marvel installments but still a solid fun film
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this installment was better than the last two which felt smaller in scope. My kids had a great time!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Somebody vomited CGI all over the screen while taking writing tips from the most ridiculous parts of Twitter and called it a movie. This movie is just complete nonsense.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a fun movie and a great start to phase 5 of the MCU!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just seen the movie. Enjoyed the whole of it. Don't believe the critics, watch the movie and enjoy."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was so far the weakest MCU production to date. Terrible copy and a mix od star wars and ragnarok.
Clusterf*ck."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Really fun movie. Some parts were cringey and weird but for the most part this was an enjoyable ride with an awesome villain.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's fun, I don't know what everyone expects from going to the movies as a break from work life.
Does the story have to be intense, dramatic, cruel or very funny?
Why does everyone have to criticize movies all the time just can't they enjoy it?"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"In the last 15 years, we've seen a considerable amount of marvel movies where the story is a small part a bigger overall picture. The same can be said about the latest installment of Ant-Man. The journey back to the quantum realm has been nothing short of a psychedelic trip. The serious tone and somewhat brutal display of Kang is exactly the narrative shift that the MCU needs after the last 2 years of an oversubstance of TV shows that sometimes have too much of a cushy feeling to them. With that said, the movie does have its heartfelt moments but in a way where the audience still feels a sense of gravitas towards the situation with Kang. Overall, Ant-man has been a solid platform in which to delve a little deeper into the mystery of both the quantum realm and multiverse."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"don't listen to the critics or let rotten tomatoes sway your decision if you you should or shouldn't see this movie. I enjoyed immensely. my theater was packed and the whole crowd was with it. had a great time. kang is that guy and M. O. D. O. K was ugly creepy and funny as he should be lol. go see it , or don't!. I think you should üòâ"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of marvels worst!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Meh. Best way to describe it. It was kind of boring. I fell asleep at least twice. Not sure what happened to these amazing actors, but they were pretty bad here. I just find Kang extremely uninteresting and the multi-verse feels like cheap writing."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"If youve watched the other ant man movies, youll appreciate this one! If you havent seen the other ones recently, Id rewatch those, and then watch this. Itll make the movie that much more enjoyable."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant man and the wasp Quantumainia completes the Trilogy of hero. The movie is seems to be very predictable(rarely) sometime but it provides everything you need like emotional scenes, action scenes, vfx heavy visuals & sort of time-travel. Jonathan Major's KANG THE CONQUEROR, is just fascinating. Chemistry b/w Scott, Casey and Hope was also fabulous üëå. M.O.D.O.K was totally wasted by MARVEL, which is unforgettable. VFX of starting 30-40 min. lacks but completes it's task. Post-credit scene and End-credit is very important for Multiversal Saga."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Avatar 2 ruined marvel movies because this cgi looks like spy kids and is distracting. Most jokes land flat, most characters are hastily put together, honestly just let down. Unfortunately I feel like it was worse than the second one. Externals feels more impactful because I was just so taken back by poor movie making. What happened to the visuals we saw in doctor strange? Just all around disappointing"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love it.... LOVE IT!!! I love Sci-fi... even the obscure low budget foreign Sci-fi movies. Quantumania is pure Sci-fi and it is magical!

[SPOILERS AHEAD]

I don't like to read or watch movie reviews before I watch the actual movie but my only exception is when the movie got really bad reviews. I wanna know how bad it is so I can lower my expectations... and damn... Quantumania got really bad reviews. 

What I got from these reviews are... seems like they are trapped in the 2 previous Ant-Man movies mindset especially on the humor. They also talk a lot about plot holes. When Marvel introduced the Multiverse... that already a big ass plot holes in MCU. Every other MCU movies that dealt with Multiverse have multiple plot holes in it.

Some also seems like unable to accept a secondary level Avenger facing an Avengers level big villain like Kang.

Quantumania is a movie introducing Kang to MCU phase 5... and the movie successfully done it. Jonathan Majors as Kang is amazing... Kang is absolutely menacing and scary.

Ant-Man defeating Kang is very important for Phase 5 Kang Dynasty movie... if a secondary level Avenger can kill a Kang who already killed other variants of Kang in other Multiverse... what more destruction a top tier level Avengers can do to other Kang variants... hence the 1st post credit scene.

This movie called Ant-Man and The Wasp... many reviews also said Wasp not so much in the movie. What version of Quantumania are they watching?? Hope / Wasp is in the movie from the get go until the end. She has a big role in the movie.

The movie itself is great... magical Quantum Realm... fast pace... non stop action packed... funny... emotional... a lot of ants and a lot of Ant-Man. All characters are great... the Pym family... Cassie... the freedom fighters and even MODOK is awesome... if you ever watched Patton Oswalt MODOK... he's about 80% like

Highly...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED... 8.5/10... Quantumania for me is the best Ant-Man movie in the franchise and the best MCU phase 4 movie since Spider-Man No Way Home. 

2nd post credit scenes.... can't wait for Loki season 2."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"""I have holes!"" 'Nuff said!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sadly, this was not a great start for phase 5. The scenes that should have been tense and scary felt boring. Although I like Kathryn Newton's previous work, she was not a good fit for Cassie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is definitely better than She-hulk and Thor. Could be better, more impactful like someone of the protagonists could (and should) die. But overall it was nice, fun (right amount of fun) and lot of action. Marvel may be coming back"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Was A fun ride and new villians and was very good will watch again.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was very entertained watching Quantumania; Kang is incredible!  It's a little weird in some parts and not as humor-filled as previous Ant-Man films, but it's definately worth the watch."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Some of the dialogue could've been better, but overall it's a great addition to the MCU. One of the better Marvel movies of the last year, and in my opinion blows the other two Ant-Man movies out of the water. 

They did a great job of giving us a more in depth look into the quantum realm, and like other Ant-Man movies it had some laugh out loud moments."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The first half of the movie kinda felt slow. But it definitely doesn't deserve the rotten ratings as given by the critics. Jonathan Majors is absolutely brilliant as Kangüëè
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man for the win! This was a phenomenal movie! I loved it! Ant-Man meets Star Wars meets Avatar. I know it sounds crazy, but it‚Äôs so so so good. It‚Äôs been a long time since I left a Marvel movie super pleased and stoked by it. What a way to kick off Phase 5. I cannot wait to see it again."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a solid Marvel movie - does a great job with call backs and staying true to the trilogy while raising the stakes. The movie excels when introducing the new characters specifically Kang. The VFX could have used some work in certain parts but overall a good watch.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A great start to phase 5.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The creature design was cool and Jonathan Majors killed his role. That was about all the good stuff. It was bland, forgettable side characters, all the main actors way overacted making it feel unnatural and obnoxious. The dialogue was clunky and sounded like it was written by a five year old. I didn't really feel like an Ant Man movie. It just felt like a 2 hour long commercial for the next Avengers movies."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely weird but a fun ride over all. Loved how much bigger it was on the third go round.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,The plot failed to get deep and stayed kind of airy and light the entire time. The acting was sub par and the dialog was super cheesy.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Has some issues but it's really a fun movie. Jonathan majors killed it as Kang.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Spoilers: Is it sadistic that I was disappointed that no one died except the one person I saw coming? It was pretty standard.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie had serious tonal issues, Kang didn't feel threatening because of the tone of everyone else in the movie and it lost the charm of previous Antman movies"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Entertaining And A Solid Start For The Saga
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Why does everyone expect so much from Ant-man. Just enjoy the totally absurd fun of it.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Forgettable plot, even if one could ever understand it...  but then, this IS the 'quantum realm' of confusion.  But I enjoyed the cinematography as a work of art, as most all such movies are, these days.   Still not sure who or what Kang, the nice 'arch-villain' really was.  
   I didn't think it was funny, but some in the audience were guffawing.
   PAUL RUDD is way overrated, as is this flick. 
   Giving it 2 RT stars, out of 5.  'Meh, passed the time.""
   Saw it opening Friday 2-27-2023,  'lerton AMC."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too much CGI.
Not enough humor."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"At last, an enjoyable post Endgame MCU Movie. Good film. Enjoyed it with my family."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was üíØ% FANTASTIC! Seriously! Because of the ridiculous critics, I went in thinking that ""they spent too much time setting up Phase 5 & not enough time on making A GOOD MOVIE"" . WELL THEY WERE WRONG. Not only was it a compelling, funny, suspenseful, thrilling, WILD RIDE from start to finish (in between the bookends), they *weren't* tons of ""setups"" for future projects.  There were the end credits scenes I won't spoil, but we've come to expect those to setup what's to come. But the movie itself literally focused on telling a really GREAT story."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's the most Science Fiction of the Marvel movies. But it was fun, and enjoyable. It did a great job setting up Kang who is terrifying. Visually the Quantum realm is gorgeous. All in all, it's definitely worth seeing in theaters."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"the best ant man movies, and properly the best movie so far phase 5
it worths waiting for"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I don't get all the hate this movie is getting. I enjoyed it and Jonathan majors is a great kang
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Between Paul Rudd's flawless delivery of comedic lines and Jonathan Majors' performance, this film was quite good."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Another win for Marvel - and a great start to trhe KANG DYNASTY!!!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It felt like watching all 9 Star Wars movies mashed up with the Ant Man cast, which is perfectly fine with me."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I did not like modoks backstory. Its not what I expected based on the comics
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best superhero movie all the time. Much better than Thor love & thunder. Jonathan Majors as KANG is killing it and best new big bad boss in phase 5
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was fun and interesting. Kang is a great new villain. I don't think the low critic score is accurate. Nice start to phase 5.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film was alot of fun. Lots of visual stimulation and lots of laughs as well! The Quantum Realm was beautiful, and felt very unique! The father-daughter relationship between Scott and Cassie was fantastic and very believable. Cassie actually felt like a young teenager, messing up but meaning well, and really just idolizing her Dad. Jonathan Majors as Kang was phenomenal, I can really see him becoming a massive threat to the multiverse! The only thing that didn't work for me was MODOK..although to be fair, I felt MODOK was silly and stupid in the comics as well...so I can't really blame the film for this miss. I did miss Scott's merry band of thieves, but loved the Baskin Robbins callbacks! I wouldn't say this movie is top tier MCU, but it was alot of fun and definitely doesn't deserve all the critical hate it's been getting. To me it was better than Thor: Love & Thunder and even better than Iron Man 3. I can definitely see Phase 5 of the MCU starting to string together all the pieces that Phase 4 threw out there! I knew Feige was to be trusted, we all just had to be patient cause it's all coming together! I'm really intrigued and excited for this next phase of the MCU!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was one of the better marvel projects in recent years but it is an acquired taste. It‚Äôs a mind messing movie so be prepared for that, but overall a very solid movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Ok so I was hesitant because of ratings but the movie was very good ... After no way home finally I get to see another real Marvel movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is a great cliffhanger and ending to the antman trilogy. It keeps the elements that made antman antman while keeping the serious danger and threat in the air. Kang was amazing. I think the consequences were missing but I'm sure future films will make up for it
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, didn't expect it to be this good, especially after the trash reviews. Absolute must watch on the biggest screen possible."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,movie critics are so dull these days. this is no where near as bad as they're all saying. i actually enjoyed this more than wakanda forever. it didn't overstay its welcome. and it was GOOD. it was like a star wars movie tbf. the ant man films haven't been the best but they're enjoyable. kang was awesome.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Super fun movie! Johnathan Majors was amazing! I cannot wait to see him terrorize throughout the Marvel Universe!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing VFX! Action in every second , love it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A really really solid start to this new phase....there needs to be an embargo on critics reviews until the movie is released to see if that alters perception. I feel people see that it has bad reviews and they go into theater looking to see why it was given bad reviews and watch it with that negative perception.

Majors was next level, Rudd was spectacular as always.

 I read somewhere someone said there was no stakes. They must have went on a bathroom break when Kang said If you don't bring me what I need I will kill your daughter in front of you and make you relive that moment over and over endlessly until you be me to kill you.  Stop having expectations stop wanting something in a film and just sit back and enjoy. It was great....I enjoy everything Marvel does"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,So stupid. Marvel movies are getting so gimicky. Honestly sad
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Super entertaining. A great addition to the Ant Man legacy.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Mind melted by how much information was given to us with this one. This phase of the MCU will be limitless to the who's the how's and the what's. Lots of big names in this movie and I feel that the movie came very full circle. I enjoyed the relationship Scott and Cassy share. I also like that Marvel isn't changing Scott's character traits as much as some of their other characters. All around a great movie and can't say I have much to complain about.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think we're getting Marvel fatigue. I could have enjoyed this better on Disney Plus
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall, just a fun marvel movie promising something big. The villain was
great (7/ 10)"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I mean it‚Äôs alrightü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"For a movie that's called Ant-Man AND The Wasp, Wasp barely does anything the whole movie lol

Regardless, it's a pretty good movie, even with a few weird choices."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The comedy on this one is the best one out of all Ant man's. Good plot, villain always needs a bit of work but overall better than expected."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"You should see it if you are a Marvel MCU fan, but it is not going to make your top 10. Just go and realize that Marvel/Disney know they need to make some real changes to their release and project schedules. These projects need more time to cook and less corner cutting with CGI investments, story writers, and editing. I am not regretful I saw it. However, I wish they had spent more time to live up to the real Marvel standard."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great film. It for sure felt childish at times but overall I understood what was happening and Kang was awesome! The end was phenomenal got to see Kang go ham on everyone. It was lit enjoyable movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The post credit scenes are so exciting, and set up so much. And the movie is so engaging."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This film reminds me of what Marvel used to be before phase 4. I hope phase 5 can build on the momentum of this film.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie cool effects good 3d loved it
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed every minute of it
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'll be honest. Not great. Marvel hasn't been good for a while now.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked the movie, it's not my favorite movie in the mcu but it's still decent. It felt alot like a sanitized guardians of the galaxy movie and not really a antman movie, I wouldn't be suprised if the director is using this as a proof of concept so he can helm the next trilogy of Guardians of the galaxy movies or even a Nova project since James Gunn is leaving Marvel. Alot of the fun from the first 2 movies was missing but I think it's because I missed the Xcon crew, Jimmy Wu and Scott's ex-wife and her husband. Cassie also felt underdeveloped and Scott and Hope being married is just mentioned but they seem to have less chemistry than previous antman movies and they don't even kiss. Kang was awesome,  he felt like a real threat and I doubt it's the last we'll see of this version of Kang. M.O.D.O.K was funny in a wtf way lol. Jannet was great and Michelle Pfeiffer really carried this movie along with Johnathan Majors, I just wish we'd have seen her quantum realm powers she had in the second movie, and it's like the director just forgot that she had abilities when she came back from the quantum realm. There was a bit to much talking for me personally and not enough action set pieces and personally I think this movie could have worked a bit better as a mini series since they're doing a lore dump, but it was a decent enough mcu entry. I give it a 7.5 out of 10 because with all its faults it is a fun film just not the best, so lower your expectations. It sets up alot but I feel it doesn't deliver as a proper antman film and comes across as a advert for a better film that's still to come."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was great. Typical Marvel film that was much better in comparison to Dr. Strange. Of course like a classic Disney marvel movie they force the jokes but the overall story and action was excellent. Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) was perfect in his role and his future as the main villain is building to be epic. Don't take the critics opinion if you enjoy a classic Marvel movie, this is it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Introduction to Kang
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am so excited when I heared a news abt this, and its here now!
I cant put it in words how amazed by this movie. Cant wait for  Avengers: Kang Dynasty... Please watch this it is really worth watching. I can watch this all week, nonstop!!! Love this!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing Cast - writing probably needed little more work.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is a ton of fun. Is it top tier Marvel? No. But is far better (in my opinion) than some of the other marvel movies (I'm looking at you Love and Thunder). Jonathan Majors was FANTASTIC as Kang, and Paul Rudd is as charming as ever - and we get to see a different side of Scott Lang to boot! His relationship with Cassie is on full display and I ate it up. The supporting characters were all on their game. I plan on seeing it again in the theater."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jonathan Majors as Kang is a 10 out of 10, holy shit did they cast Kang perfectly.

Paul Rudd did a fantastic job as well.

But HOLY SH*T.

It's like writers aren't even trying anymore, they have fast and furious'd the sh*t out of the MCU. They'll keep throwing new heroes and villains in our faces (in the MCU) as long as we're going to see them.

When hulk Discovered Thanos was coming, it was literally the first sentence out of his mouth and he was terrified to be hulk again.

When Janet Discovered Kang and got rescued she didn't say SH*T, it makes no sense.  Then as soon as she gets back to the quantum realm, she jumps into action and then is smiling the whole way through... Janet had all these wonderful experiences in the quantum realm and didn't think to mention it at all? You could say that she wanted to protect them, sure fine I'm okay with it.

Jump forward to when they have to retrieve the multiversal engine, somehow Janet whose only seen this thing in a small form knows what happens when you're inside the device? Tells Hope you're I'm a realm of possibilities or whatever it was called and then hope magically knows she has to shrink down to get inside of it, then magically knows that she's gotta hit it with Pym particles. Hope couldn't hear Scott until he was already inside so she couldn't have heard the convo. Did I miss Scott telling Hope what they had to do? Maybe, idk I get fixated on the plot hole lol.

Then to jump back, you're meaning to tell me that M.O.D.O.K has the technology to fucking track a signal and create a warp hole to drag people in but doesn't have the technology to get out???? Did they just magically pass through pym particles to shrink down? Doesn't make sense whatsoever.

AND THEN when they are trying to escape and Scott and hope get stuck Cassie is able to open up another portal using the same technology that made it previously possible even though it was just DESTROYED. Suddenly Cassie knows how to open up quantum realm portals..... fast and furious'd

What good is a force field anymore?

So the ants were able to go through 1000 years... thousands of ants had the same experience but none of the humans that fell had a time-lapse experience.. plot hole padding. And Kang NEVER encountered them? Maybe it was instantaneous, that's fine but still odd. 

They got M.O.D.O.K right.... for about 5 seconds and then the rest was just.. idk stupid screen time filler. The representation of him image-wise was spot on.
Plot holes aside if they got to the part where they threw Kang into the multiversal engine. I believe that is where Kang's time lines connects and where all his variants are made. At one point he held up a multiversal ring that represented his timeline. That moment is the beginning and the end for Kang, it superseded his birth. That means he kills every single avenger and then the new avengers banish him into the quantum realm where he encounters Janet and that part of his timeline begins. That's just my theory as to why he knows he will never go away and why he knows what's coming.

 I believe that inside that multidimensional engine is where the TVA is and when Loki gets back inside is long after Kang's gets forced in. All his variants take over different parts of the TVA etc. And Loki starts a revolution and Kang escapes and the regular TVA takes over and it goes back and that's how the superseding event takes place. But this is a separate theory.

We just want good content. The action is great but just make it make sense that's why people hate the fast and furious."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,We loved it. My husband isn't a big fan of Marvel movies and thought this one was funny and exciting and very entertaining. It will really be one of the most fun MCU movies for us. So much action. Michelle Pfeiffer was fantastic. And Jonathan Majors really steals the show. Great MCU film.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the low score for this movie.  It was quite enjoyable.  The audience score really tells the whole story.  The pacing was quite good, and the story really flows."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely a feel-good Marvel movie that leads into the grander scheme of the MCU
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a great movie. My son loved it too. Very funny. Lots of heart. Special effects were great. I don't know what these critics were expecting.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very fun movie. Kang was as advertised. The Ant family is cute and funny. Critics were way harsh on this. The fact that this has worst critics scores than some phase 1/2 installments is telling for how critics think about the MCU now. But also, forget the critics, form your own opinions."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a great movie ! My son & I enjoyed it so much
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was very visually appealing, love to see the new big bad Kang. Cut scenes are great and fight scenes are awesome!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed the watch, it overall met my expectations and was enjoyable. I was slightly disappointed with Modok and underwhelmed with Kang‚Äôs ending in this story but overall it wasn‚Äôt enough for me to dislike the movie. Would recommend"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Movie , The  Best Out Of The 3"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved watching Michelle Pfeiffer. Evangeline Lilly look very cute with her new haircut. Kang the conqueror was really good and very intimidating.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,From start to finish this was action packed. You leave the theater wanting more and appreciating Scott Lang more. Great start to phase 5.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Thought it was great!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you're looking for a nice action adventure film then here's your chance. I'll admit some moments were a little cringe especially with some of the actors,
 And cgi but it's still worth seeing"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year so far.  I will definitely watch it again.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Phenomenal Setup For The Growth And Development Of Kang The Conqueror As The Main Long Term Villain And For The Young Avengers Going Forward Into The Future.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantamania, could've been an amazing movie to begin Marvel's ""Phase 5"" and journey through the Multiverse Saga. However, the movie just didn't deliver. Aside from the god awful VFX/CGI, the plot was mediocre (if there actually was one). I could write a novel on how bad this movie was, but this movie doesn't deserve that much time from me, as it already wasted plenty of mine. I do believe that Marvel is on a downhill slope for me. Phase 4 was an absolute nightmare, only having 2 movies actually being worth to watch. Phase 5 is off to a rough start, but hopefully Marvel can pick it up in the next film. I give this film a 3/10, only because the post credit scene saved it. If it wasn't for the post credit scene, it would be receiving a 1/10. Awful movie, awful plot, great actors, terrible script and director. Please keep this director from any future marvel films."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Apart from other Ant man movies, this movie is set in the quantum universe making it visually stunning. Especially the imax experience was worth it.
The movie is not specific to Scott but explores all 4 characters, Scott, Cassie, Janet and Hope, officially setting foot in the MCU with Kang, the conqueror, Jonathan Majors as a supervillian. It lays an amazing foundation for Avengers, the Kang dynasty. Kang will be next supervillian post Thanos and believe me he has a great screen presence. I felt second half was just sprinting towards the climax and the climax was long and foreseen, no goosebumps. Would have loved to explore and dive into the quantum realm but apart from VFX, it was a missed opportunity.

Overall for Marvel fans, go ahead and watch. Its entertaining, visually aesthetic and an official introduction to Kang Dnt miss the end credits scene). For others another classic hero villian story with good VFX, can be skipped"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good start for Marvel Phase 5. Sometimes, good thing don't have to be very good, but just get things done. cya phase 4, time to get away from Dark age of Marvel. By the way, for fix Disney star wars, just deep fake the chart. and Neo Star War is good to go."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just saw it and it was absolutely great! I love that it felt like a good mixture of just a classic Ant-Man adventure but at the same time with Avengers level events, action, and just chaos. Jonathan Majors is without a doubt probably the best casting option for Kang, his acting was really on point with what a conquerer should be. I give Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania a 8/10!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"was borning and bad storyline ,, it was all over the place"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie, definitely hated on for no good reason, MODOK was great but didn't want him to come back like he did.  Johnathan Majors is amazing and the family banter is great. It is what I wanted from the last of the ant-man trilogy and gets me excited for phase 5!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Existential nightmare. Seven year old was confused and scared.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Not listening to reviews anymore!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Now, while YES I am a fan of the MCU I have found that the projects in Phase 4 were Experimental and while sometimes it worked most of it was to its detriment, that being said I personally believe that this movie is one of the best projects that MarvelStudios have put out in recent times, But, I have a few issues with it
First off Hope Van Dyne didn't really do much within the actual film, she did contribute to the overall events but she didn't do much outside of the setpieces, Second there are bits where I wish we could see more of the Quantum realm and how it's Society actually functioned before Kangs Arrival, I also feel as if they wasted any future potential for a certain character by Axing them off, but I can understand why that decision was made considering another character will be introduced (technically RE-introduced) with the same abilities and character plot

I give my HIGHEST Praises to Johnathan Majors' Kang the Conqueror, every moment he is on screen he just has this Preasence that only Majors could deliver

Paul Rudd delivers a performance that is memorable, witty, and heartfelt as he usually does

Evangeline Lily was amazing as she usually is but the script was more focused on the dynamic between Rudd and Newtons characters

Kathryn Newton really brought Cassie Lang into her own with her performance that felt fairly genuine when paired with Pail Rudd's Scott Lang

Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas continue to shine with their Dynamic Chemistry as Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne with Bill Murray adding to that brilliant duo with his Brief appearance as Krylar

Overall I'd give this movie a Solid 8 out of 10 for people who just want to experience a heartfelt story shot in a Beautiful Science Fiction World
And a 9out of 10 for followers of the Marvel Studios Story"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"One kang week variant got defeated he is not dead just trapped, look up who kang is before you rate this movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun movie. After credit scenes are worth watching. Definitely NOT an ‚ÄúAvengers level‚Äù movie like it was hyped to be, but it was fun to watch. It is an Ant Man movie - second tier, not the best Marvel has to offer."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The whole film was great! I liked everyone‚Äôs character & Scott & Kang. Wow. Amazing performances from both of them.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I don‚Äôt know what the critics are talking about. This movie good. It‚Äôs not perfect but had a lot of fun watching it. And some good funny parts too.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie and worth watching in the theatre, don't expect too much from it; enjoy it as it gives you a thrill."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è!!!NO SPOILERS!!!‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
I watched this movie! I can say that Ant's triquel was a success, I don't understand why critics scold him so much, now in order what I liked and what I didn't like
1)Scott and Cassie, there is a Father-daughter chemistry between them, they save the world together and that makes me happy.
2) Janet and Hank, they are not the most central characters here, but they also play a role in the film, there is such a frame in the film with Hank, he is very funny.Janet, as a narrator, tells half of the film about everything and it pleases that the film has an explanation for almost everything!
3) Kang, it's not for nothing that he is a CONQUEROR, Jonathan Majers, he just shines in this film, his voice, his facial expressions, his goal is to conquer something, and destroy something completely! His canonical costume is just fire! They finally managed to make a cool villain who will come back, and I think more than once.
4) Modok is a cool guy, he puts himself up as a cool guy with guns up his sleeve, he has a funny face, I won't say anything more.
5) Graphics, what about graphics, and there is a lot of it in this film, and I am glad that it is finished and there are no flaws in the graphics
6) Living beings, well, or residents of the Quantum realm, they also stood out very well, everyone has their own costume and they are also so cute and brave!
Well, the minuses of this movie!
(ALL THE MINUSES THAT ARE WRITTEN HERE, THIS IS PURELY MY OPINION!!!)
1) There are several dialogues in the film, well, they are very stupid, they are just too long and I just want to reduce them to a minimum
2) In my opinion, there was very little Kang, it seems to me that such a powerful villain should be given more time on the screen.
3) Hope, what's wrong with her? She just walks the whole movie, and does nothing to promote the plot, she's just like butter on bread.
I may not have written everything here, but you can watch this movie at least once!In short, the film at one time is no more.
The scenes after the credits just shock you, they are so cool you need to look at them in cinemas, be sure to stay until the end of the session!
My rating:
8/10"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Special cgi effects awesome!! Loved it
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie I loved it!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the end where Kang the conqueror was going to finish Ant-man! Im excited to see the Kang dynasty!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely more in-line w/the audience score. Who tf rates these things is not the audience. They find these guys under a rock? This is the MCU mfs. If u ain't w/in by now, tf u doin' even watching this movie?!??"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was everything I expected and a little more... definitely better than thor love and thunder
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Overall better then most of phase 4 I liked the movie kang will conquer this saga
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a ride into the Quantum Realm! So many emotions happening.  The ptsd after this film has me in high gear for the Avengers. I can definitely say I felt the heart of Ant-man & adored watching Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas OG, & Jonathan Majors ripping the screen with every inch as Kang The Conqueror!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is a very adventurous movie and also, there are some comedies which make the movie more interesting. Also, It is more planned film than movies of phase 4"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a great ride! Love Kang and Scott Lang! Quantum realm is insane!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the movie. Yes it's a lot of setup for the next phase but they still delivered character stories along the way. Kang is the awesome big bad.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,The plot needed work. The ending was stupid. Kang is simply not Thanos.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed this film. Fun, exciting and the quantum realm was wild. 
Jonathan Majors was amazing as Kang. Can't wait to see him in more Marvel movies."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed it but it was definitely set up movie. Jonathan majors killed it. Needed more of him and his story. Modok was interesting to say the least. Rudd is still the man. Overall enjoyable but could have benefited from a longer run time time
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Khan great  ,Visual maybe? Storyline weak , joke suck"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was solid good set up for future MCU. The Humor  was good when they wouldn't force it but when it was forced it was cringe. The end fight scenes took it too the next level. So did the Post Credits. Overall solid movie opened up a whole new world of possibilities for marvel gave it about a 75%.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pros: Jonathan Majors as Kang, we get to see more of the expanded universe, ""I have holes!!"", the second post credit scene.

Cons: weird editing/jumps through the story, waste of potential for Modoks character.

Overall it's a very enjoyable film, lots of comedic relief (which if that's a complaint for you, sorry but that's literally expected of Ant-Man/Paul Rudd - welcome to Marvel?) I just wish they took the time to make it a bit longer so some of the jumps in the story didn't feel as off with editing. I'm excited to see where things go from here."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie really opens up the next phase of the Marvel Universe. Kang the Conqueror did not dissapoint.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect blend of comedy and action
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I would say it was pretty good and the plot was nice. Nothing TOO special but it's recommended! The acting was phenomenal. But.. forced humour.. especially in serious scenes.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A great Sci-Fi action film. An Entertaining Marvel film. The critics are way off base. It's about entertain. Don't overthink it as Scott Lang would say.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a really good movie I liked it
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"horrible movie, felt like i was watching a shark boy and lava girl knock off"

"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,OMG! The critics are NUTS. This movie was TERRIFIC! 9/10! Go see it! üòäüêú
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was fun and fresh but also different from what we got within the first two Ant-Man movies. This is due to the fact that the stakes were a lot higher in this movie compared to the first two. It didn't really fit ant-man's character to go up against such a high level threat with the help that he had. Jonathan Majors stole the show for a chunk of the movie and portrayed a menacing villain brilliantly. Other than that, overall it was an enjoyable watch."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just a little childish didn't know much about the quantym relm left the movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie. Didn't love the ending with Kang because someone should have died. It got a little too weird with all the different creatures at times. But I liked being introduced to the Quantum Realm and loved Kang. Looking forward to the next time we see him. Hopefully it won't be so expected.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was amazing!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"My partner and I both thought it was great. We've both seen all of the previous movies, tv shows, and specials. Over the last couple of years there have been few Marvel properties that we would be interested in seeing more than once. This one? We're both down to see it again once it hits Disney+. Returning characters were all great, this Kang variant was awesome, and M.O.D.O.K. was fantastic. All of the other supporting ""alien"" characters were great as well. Post-credits scenes are also highly consequential and interesting. To quote my lady friend, ""That was the best Star Wars movie I've ever seen!"". Me? I concur."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly I thought it was a pretty good action and science fiction movie. If you like Marvel movies you will like this one too.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutly amazing. Kang is incredible
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Copied Star Wars. Pathetic and lazy. Seen it dozens of times. Paul Rudd was the only good thing about it. 
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed it.  I am a hardcore MCU fan and the Antman flicks have never been my bag.  What makes this one is Jonathan Majors' Kang.  The villain of the Mutiverse saga has arrived and is awesome!  My full review is on my YouTube channel X-Lair.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great 3rd movie for the Ant-Man Saga, I enjoyed the classic MCU humor in scenes. This movie definitely had a more serious tone than the other two movies and that set it apart. This movie was the build up in the Kang saga that I've been looking for in the MCU phase 4 I'd give it an 8.7"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It promises with its purpose to give an introduction to Kang's power level.  Jonathan Majors & Michelle Pfeiffer steal the show
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I don‚Äôt get why there so much hate on this movie. Pretty similar to the other Antman movies. Not sure if it‚Äôs better or worse than the others but still enjoy this movie. Kang was a good villain. Story was mediocre and some characters were sidelined however
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst of the Ant-man trilogy.  I didn't hate it but it wasn't memorable and I don't ever need to see it again.  The trend of disappointing MCU movies continues....
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics who reviewed this negatively shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to watch Marvel movies ever again. Great movie. On par with the last Dr Strange, Thor, and Black Panther. Kang is incredible, the plot is perfect, humor, action, etc. I would give it 4 stars, but the extra one is to counteract the haters. "
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good entertained movie :)
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a villain driven story that is setting up the next phase, view this movie as a transformative adventure and you will be satisfied. I would not call it a ant-man movie per say, it was more of The conquerors movie from my perspective."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had a fantastic time seeing this movie. Jonathan Kang was amazing as Kang and Paul Rudd portrayal as Antman was different than the first 2 movies but he hit it out of the park. The story was interesting and the humor, while landing flat sometimes, had me laughing throughout the movie.  Looking for a good time? See this movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Liked almost everything except the execution of MODOK, he could be more than just a joke character."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I disliked the whole movie! 




NOT!!!:0p"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun.  Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd are great.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite being set in the quantum realm and released in the bleak midwinter, this film was a big, fun, rock em sock em adventure. Majors is brilliant, Rudd never disappoints, and the hero moments loomed large and the story sets the table for the next phase of the MCU in such a way that leaves you craving the next course."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a great sequel, very entertaining, not as funny or deep as people might hope, but still a solid entry for Phase 5 of the MCU"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,After a long time it felt fresh and execution watching a marvel movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the ending was great very entertaining, maybe lacking some things here and there but overall was a great watch and I highly recommend to watch. (unless you're a stinky smelly 40 yr old Marvel fan obsessed with the comics)"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Plot holes, terrible humor, terrible acting. Disney just making money and plebs eat it up cause its MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are tripping, it‚Äôs a good watch. Jonathan Majors kills it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite going in watching the movie, hearing all the bad reviews, I really enjoyed this movie. I'm excited for what comes next."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great set up Movie.  Worth the wait.  Is Kang good or evil or something else is the question I'm left to ponder?  Bring on Loki 2 so we can get more of Kang Einstein
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved this movie - it was thoroughly entertaining, had great emotion and family ties, and furthered this next saga storyline. AND‚Ä¶the ants showed up!! My daughter and I had a blast!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Worth the wait to see a proper KANG and setup for the phase! So fun will see again!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Both fun and exciting and moves the MCU forward in a great way! Paul Rudd is a favorite who does not disappoint. So many other great characters and a fun story. Was definitely entertained!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not very good. kind of cringy and cheesy. not at all what i expected from a marvel movie
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I honestly was very underwhelmed and disappointed. The only positive for me was Jonathan Majors as Kang. Other than that, the jokes did not land, and the movie's pacing was really weird. This is the first marvel movie I came out of really not liking."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"You know the reviews and critics, even the ones I follow on you tube.. what we're you looking for?? Because that movie packed a punch. It was balanced with all the actors. Everyone had a moment in the spotlight. Not to mention the visual effects and backgrounds were out of this world.  I feel critics and reviewers got so used to a typical format that movies especially Marvel would present. This isn't 2019 anymore or rather pre covid. Times have changed and so have the audiences.  Not to mention diehard fans get mad because they want the movie their way. These movies have to appeal to all audiences. I sometimes think reviewers and critics are in some kind of guild, where they just all decide to smash on a movie, not in a sexual way.  And even though the movie was dark it shared many light hearted and ""COMIC BOOK"" moments.  You can tell from this movie something big and threatening is coming and this is just the beginning.  My only regret is I didn't see it in IMAX. Which I will now.  Great job to everyone!!!!!!!  I never saw this as a trilogy ending set. But what do I know?  It was great entertainment. I could see several times over. Good start into Phase 5. Notice the AUDIENCE score is 84% as of 9:36pm."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the first MCU entry where the Rotten Tomatoes critics score genuinely confused me. It was a fun sci-fi heavy romp that raised the stakes without taking itself too seriously. 

There were some missed opportunities and pacing issues (especially second act), but overall this movie works. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to seeing it again. 

The performances in the movie were strong. However, Jonathan Majors as Kang is on another level. He owned every scene he was in and felt genuinely threatening. 

I won't guarantee you will like the movie, but don't let the critics talk you out of a chance to make up your own mind. Give it go. It is easily better than the majority of what was delivered by MCU Phase 4 movies."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang: Quantumania

Enjoy!!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel not at its best if being nice some cool parts but overall its close to but better than Thor love and Thunder ,which was terrible. So hey"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it better than wakanda forever
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This sets up all well for the Infinity Saga. The Cast especially Jonthan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer nailed their roles to perfection.

One backlog I noticed would be the rushing of some characters without proper intro to fit inside the screen time. Unnecessary comedies should have been avoided instead. 

Its a fun movie to watch."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Had its entertaining moments but definitely not much to write home about
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,it's better and so far it's a hit.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, comfortable seats, and good beer."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stay for 2 endings!

Made for a great night for my friends and I  We laughed a lot and enjoyed thr ride.

Really solid setup to the Kang Saga."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie visually stunning great storytelling loved the action and perfect blend of comedy A+
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Disappointing. It's sad to say it and it pains me to say it but this movie hurt. The potential for something much more serious turned into a joke hurts. Is that all the mcu is now? Just a joke? This movie is a joke for sure.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"They've made an Ant-Man movie that gets it right, while also showing off a sense of wonder in the Quantum Realm. Hope could have used a little more screen time or something to do, but other than that, it's a really good time at the theaters. I'll be seeing it again!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed watching this movie. And I'd see it again. Lots of laughs, serious when it needed to be."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"amazing movie, would highly recommend to anyone"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors as kang is an absolute menace, Modok was really good, overall very good movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania is a movie full of surprises, action and entertaining, as well as exciting. I think it paves a great path for the next MCU projects, mainly Kang Dynasty Avengers."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Incredibly generic, uninspired, and forgettable. So many cliche Marvel tropes, part of me suspects the script was generated by an AI trained on previous MCU movies."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It told of future problems in the Marvel Universe that's going to continue. From the ant hills  to the mountains of all the times.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wasted potential honestly I never expected it to be good anyway  only reason why it gets a 3 star is Kang
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly this was a great movie.  Not up to End Game standards but I wasn't expecting that.  It is however one of the best movies of this phase and a great introduction to Kang.  He came off just as he should, intelligent and powerful, a dangerous combination.  It should help lead to the future of the MCU.  Ignore the critics and see for yourself."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Although I need to watch an MCU movie two or three times before giving it my real number, a 7 score is where my mind first went. From a production standpoint, the film isn't incredibly impressive. They use trippy visuals and lots of colorful explosions to try and trick you into thinking it's impressive, but I found the practical production with character suits more impressive than the CGI visuals. The film even has some Star Wars influence in both the CGI and practical production, which I think is a cool touch.

The story of the movie is where things get a bit more complicated. The beginning feels rushed, and the movie tries to balance a serious tone with classic Ant-Man humor. I appreciate the attempt, but I don't think it quite hits the mark. They didn't fully commit to the serious moments, which takes away some of the excitement. It felt like they were trying to deliver a serious tone as they introduced the next big bad of the MCU, but didn't want to give up what the Ant-Man movies have been so far. Instead of making this a serious Ant-Man movie, they threw serious aspects into an Ant-Man movie, but did not fully commit in the moments that probably would have mattered most and would have made the film more effective. One issue I have with this movie is that the characters the film wants you to believe are main characters don't really get that treatment. Scott Lang hits the minimum requirements to be called the main character of this movie, and the Wasp is barely in it in any meaningful way. The film was entertaining, but it's not the best start to Phase 5.

That being said, the acting was great from almost everyone, especially Jonathan Majors, who definitely feels ready to be the big bad for this new saga. Although his character had some questionable moments, there's no doubt in his performance, and every time he was on screen, I felt captivated. Michelle Pfeiffer was also phenomenal. However, the story that they had her acting in could have been better. One question that I did find myself asking was why the film felt the need to cast Kathryn Newton as Cassandra Lang. She did an okay job, but it didn't blow me away. They could have brought in Emma Fuhrmann or Abby Ryder Fortson instead.

Overall, I'd say that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a 7/10 movie that I'd definitely watch again before some of the other MCU movies."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie and addition to the Ant-Man trilogy! I have to say tho, Jonathan Majors stole the show. His acting is just next level. And Kang is definitely going to be a problem. 

PS - The critics are 100% smoking laced crack cocaine. This film is NOWHERE near as bad as they tried to make it sound. And I think most would agree considering the huge difference in critic rating and audience rating."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the movie! Bring the kids.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,very entertaining and full of action
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"So good, fun time. Visuals are amazing. Kang is absolutely brutal. Moves really quick will Def be going to see again. Good laughs with family heart."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's getting a bunch of bad reviews, but I had fun with it. Was it the best MCU film? No, probably not, but I enjoyed what was in front of me.

What it was NOT was the silly atmosphere of the first two Ant-Man movies. This one was far more serious as it's the stepping stone for Phase V of the MCU (this was the first film in it).

Probably will need to see it again to grab everything.

Actor alert: I forgot the actor who plays Chidi in 'The Good Place' is in this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,2nd half of this movie lived up to the hype!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A great intro to the Kang madness! Can‚Äôt wait for more! üêúü™∞ü•ú
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good movie it sets up the next phase and Kang was awesome! Make sure to stay until the end credits.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the unity of the family.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Nice visuals but felt like a Star Wars duplicate. Terrible dialogue!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,IT WAS VERY GOOD KANG WAS AMAZING AND THE REST OF THE CAST PERFORMANCES WAS AMAZING AS WELL AND BOY IM EXCITED FOR THE FUTURE FOR THE MULTIVERSE SAGA
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang carried!  Ant-Man movies have a certain level of humor that's always going to thread through the plot, but they also didn't skimp on heart.  This movie built upon the Kang domination of the phase and I can't wait to see what happens next."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I really enjoyed the movie. Is does a good job setting up the next movies
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors is great. Paul Rudd is always funny.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äúbest‚Äù marvel but not the ‚Äúworst‚Äù probably could have been made into tv show. I‚Äôd probably wait until it‚Äôs available for streaming. 
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not everyone has to be a Dck
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Bigger in scale and more serious than the previous ""Ant-Man""s, ""Quantumania"" serves as a major stepping stone in the rise of Jonathan Majors' well-done Kang the Conquerer, even if barely anyone else has any development this time."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pretty fun time, not too much else to say about it"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I found it complete. It presents a powerful villian for the next saga that also has great potential. The movie is funny as always, mainly because of Paul Rudd. He's fantastic. There are some characters that i found interesting and that maybe could have more relevance, but that's something secondary."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"No era lo que esperaba, y estuvo bien, aunque deja un mal sabor, odie a M.O.D.O.K siento que desperdiciaron horriblemente a un personaje con gran potencial."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was ok, them being in the Quantamwhatever was visually exhausting.  San Francisco was such a fun backdrop, not really used beyond the first few minutes.  The funny parts were really good but not enough to save this on, first Paul Rudd movie in a LONG TIME I wouldnt recommend"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I found that the movie was very enjoyable and entertaining set up the next phase of MCU movies perfectly. Also the cast delivers an amazing performance throughout, would recommend everyone checks it out for themselves."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,the vfx and cgi is great & the credit scenes are just phenomenal
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very fun movie, I went into this film with apprehension seeing all the negative critic reviews - they typically love marvel.  Although they liked Thor 4, so who knows.  This movie was fantastic.  I wouldnt put it in my top 5 marvel films, but its top 10 probably.  The story is good, it flows well, has interesting characters, finally a well written villain - and connects to the rest of the films like we want.  

Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd are treasures - and I felt like I would be annoyed by Cassie and her character was done well too.  

A bit of language, so careful taking young kids - but not overdone - its become a theme of marvel to add cursing where its not needed.

If you liked AM or AM&tW you will like this film no problem.  My favorite marvel films are winter soldier and No Way Home, its not that good, they are 5*, but its miles above L&T and probably a bit below Ragnarok - without as much comedy this time.

All in all - critics are dumb - this film is not, check it out - dont let the critics ruin this because it should be seen on the big screen."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was awful! It was so out there that I kept hoping it would get over with soon.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very satisfying, Kang was a BEAST, lot of emotion. Some things could have been done better but all in all a very fun MCU entry!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a great continuation of the Kang story. very nicely done.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It'z an amazing movie, I don't understand why te ""experts"" punish the score. For some reason the ""experts"" don't make movies. Is easy to say something negative about a movie, but I want to see them directing and filming one."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"DONT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS!!! This movie is really good, a little cringe at times but really good, it's a great start , Jonathan Majors was incredible, perfect"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Slow start and wasn't until the scenes with Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquer did I sit up a little straighter and really get into it. I will say that the 2 post credit have me excited to see where Phase 5 will go!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Llena de humor,  accin y muchos detalles de lo que viene, es una transicin a mi gusto"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This superhero movie was really good. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton, Jonathan Majors, Bill Murray, and the rest of the cast did an excellent job in this movie. The plot of the movie was action-packed, thrilling, and entertaining. It's about protecting the world from a dangerous threat from another universe and getting home safely. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's a definite must see."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"All the humor you expect from the Ant Man series with tons of action, stunning visuals and some epic battles"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it!! Pulled a couple of marvel movies nuggets
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A film with a lot of promise that suffers from an uneven pace, little to no depth, and obvious studio meddling."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, must watch!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,save money and time and skip out on this one! cgi was terrible for marvel and acting was absolutely horrendous. the dialogue was so cheesy and story line was very disappointing. the only thing i enjoyed about this movie was it being over and the post credit scene!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie! Loved it!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't go with the critics reviews. The movie is actually good. Enjoyed it all.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was phenomenal
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was entertaining but it felt like part Star Wars and part Star Trek.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,sad modok died but a good ending
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! MODOK was meh!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Too quick to start. Too quick to end after main plot
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jonathan Majors Kang is a scene stealer
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent and excitedly good üëç üëå üëè üòÄ
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is definitely one of the Top 3 epic Marvel movies I've seen.   None of the anchor celebrities or relationships felt forced.  Nobody seemed like they were there just for a paycheck.  It felt very Guardians of the Galaxy to me, and I wouldn't be surprised if it does a better job than GotG 3 at that humor/epic comicbook game.  I won't spoil anything else, but Jonathan Majors was absolutely legendary as Kang, the Conqueror.  This movie has me hyped for Loki Season 2 and more Kang variants (hey, it's not a spoiler if Avengers 5 is called ""The Kang Dynasty"")."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kang is great. The rest is average to below average. To much prep for the next few phases and not enough focus on the smaller world Ant-man exists in. So many good elements, in particular the cast itself, but it just did not come together as well as it could have."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was entertaining, but it didn't give me the interest in the storyline that I wanted. Kang was pretty dope, and I want more of this villian."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good movie with a great villian can't wait to see more off Kang. Ant-man was sidelined a bit in the movie but over it turned out good. 6/10
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this was the best Marvel movie since ""No way Home"", it was lots of fun and had a lot of creative characters."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Really great movie and the end credits were the best big things are coming !!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best of phase 4. Ruben cameo (iykyk). Good world building and power scaling, though power balance is questionable in the 3rd act.
I have been waiting to see Kang and he did not disappoint."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! A wild ride from beginning to end. Bizarre, imaginative, and captivating. The stunning visuals added to the creative storyline. As usual, a good bit of comic relief helps to balance the serious moments. Well worth checking out."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has a different tone, but likewise it was an amazing film..."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a comic book brought to life! Strange and funny and Jonathan Majors is hot. I also love how Michael Douglas' whole role in the movie is to just say ""Ants"" and ""Holy shit!"""
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very enjoyable ride from start to finish. They really built up Kang nicely and set things up well for what's to come. I'm sure you could poke some holes in the plot if you want to nitpick every detail, but I won't be one of them. It got me excited about the MCU again which a lot of the last phase did not accomplish outside of Shang Chi and Spiderman."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"the movie good it wasn't perfect but, it was fun to watch and kang is a menace"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another good MCU movie. I loved the character development especially for Cassie and Scott. The special effects were fun, and it had some wackiness without going too far over the top. 

Kang was intense! and MODOK was disturbing on every level... just as he should have been LOL!

A really fun time at the movies - highly recommend."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Wait for the mid credits and post credits scene
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good start to the next phase of movies. If you‚Äôve enjoyed the previous ant-man movies you‚Äôll enjoy this one.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was visually stunning. Great MCU world building as well as great classic Ant-Man comedy moments. It's a must see for sure
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Esta es la clase de pel√≠culas que los fans queremos ver
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not Amazing, But Best Marvel Movie Since No Way Home"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great Marvel production!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm really scratching my head at the poor critic score as they are usually pretty accurate with marvel movies. This movie is 80-85%.  Easy. 
It did everything it was supposed to do, and did it well. Audience score is the correct score."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great concept but slow start.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it, it wasn't perfect but it wasn't Eternals bad either.  While I still think the 1st two were better, This was a setup movie introducing Kang & Cassie. I think the problem with allot of the critics is they expected it to follow the formula of the 1st two while simultaneously complaining that marvel movies follow the same formula. This movie was made to be different."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang made the movie. Watch this for Kang. He is awesome. There were also some really good moments between Scott and Cassie, and I like Cassie's character development in general. She's growing into herself in the shadow of her con/Avenger father, and that's a very interesting dynamic. This movie was silly, so if you hate that part of Marvel you will find yourself rolling your eyes a lot, but I enjoyed it. There was a sort of half-twist thing that happened near the end and played a significant role in the final battle which I didn't love. That and a couple other things knock a bit off my rating, but overall this is a way better movie than the critics would have you think."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure what everyone is expecting.. it's a solid MCU movie. Some cool stuff, some imperfect stuff. It can go toe to toe with any DCEU movie and beat most of them. 

Overall good CGI, good amount of humor, Kang was awesome, they went full sci-fi, Paul Rudd is great. 

Some moments of bad writing or acting but nothing major. 

I liked it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Marvel movie. Not much depth yet, but this sets up
What will be an excellent phase 5 and 6!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,8 out of 10. great comedic moments splicing the action scenes. middle dragged a bit but was expository. Kang stole every scene..so terrific..terrifying and super intelligent..he would make short work of Thanos! So excited to see what's next. make sure to watch both mid- and after-credits scenes
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,What a great start of phase 5. Ant-man and the wasp quantumania is up to the mark film of MCU. The acting of Jonathan Majors as Kang is really badass. Overall the movie is so enjoyable. Best film yet in Ant-man triology.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang the Conqueror is the highlight of the movie because Jonathan Majors does an excellent job. Everything else is beyond silly.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While this doesn't conclude the Ant-Man trilogy, nor does it overtly stay on track with some of the characters in a satisfying way, Paul Rudd kills it as always. The standout of this movie is Jonathan Majors as Kang. He was the best part of this film and I'm excited to see him return for more. Overall it's a fun popcorn movie, as most MCU movies are. Not perfect, not awful, just a nice little pass time."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie and we finally got to see Kang. People enjoy the movie. Marvel knows what they‚Äôre doing. Stop being too damn picky.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was like going into a dreamworld - with major consequences. Personally loved the backstory and how it somehow leaves more questions than answers. Where do we go from here? Only TIME will tell...
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"While the ambitious scope is a noticeable departure, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania still delivers the size-changing action and humorous family dynamics that powered the previous two films."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than i though it would be
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed it! Kept me entertained also had lots of humor!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm not sure why this movie was rated so low by critics. It's not a perfect movie, but I definitely don't think it's bad either. There's a good balance between the comedy and drama. My criticism would be that Kang should be shown as a bigger threat and possibly higher stakes, but it was entertaining, to say the least. 7.5/10"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Creo tiene sus puntos fuertes, aunque no es la mejor de Ant-man pero tampoco es lo peor del MCU como lo ultimo que han sacado y han calificado bien en la pagina."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie is good funny entertaining. Just go and watch it. Its doesnt deserve all the low ratings given by critics.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Really far fetched.  One of the villains was ridiculous, a flying human face."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie! The critics are crazy! Not the best marvel, but still amazing! This movies is if Star Wars and Marvel had a baby. They really took a shot for something different and it totally worked. The only critique I have is I wish they took MODOK a little more serious. I still loved the character though! All in all, a must see for what's coming in the future for marvel. Also Kang is amazing, he made everything about that movie just so much better, and it was already a great movie!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a very fun decent movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice movie! Worth watching
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I had a lot of problems with this movie, starting with the plot. I just didn't buy any of it.  It felt more like a Fantastic Four movie than an Ant-Man movie. They should have had it in the Negative Zone instead of the Quantum Realm. MODOK looked like complete crap. They should have left the helmet on him. Evangeline Lily looked like a 12-year-old boy with that haircut. Her face looked older than Michelle Pfeiffer's. This was not a flattering movie for her.  Some of the greenscreens were awful. I could see some green in Michelle Pfeiffer's hair. I never felt Kang was a threat as I did with Thanos. Overall very disappointing."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a great movie giving the characters development and some amazing scenes. Jonathan Majors as Kang was amazing, the range he has is amazing. I get the Star Wars & Dune reference but I think it worked fine and doesn't take you away from Ant Man it self. End credits were amazing and back to what they should be setting up the future. It's a must see to link in with the future projects and can't wait for the ride. Overall loved it especially my 10yr old daughter and her friend. They even found a few jumps and loved the fights. Better then Thor L&D as i can and will watch this again."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's one of the weaker MCU movies; Paul Rudd is terrific, Michelle Pfeiffer feels like she's the leading superhero, and kind of a disappointing Kang. Overall, it's still better than the Eternals."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"My son and I both went to see Ant Man and The Wasp: Quantumania  and we think it is a great movie. The best Marvel movie in years (for us). The plot is compelling, the visuals amazing, and the humor entertaining (usually).
Seeing the number of bad reviews from critics makes me want to ask if they saw the same movie we did. Another reviewer, mentioned politics being a part of it. Maybe they are correct. Marvel/Disney have struggled with many recent offers, but even a weak baseball team wins on occasion. I believe this movie wins."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,By far the worst of the MCU movies. It's basically a worse version of star wars meets Tron legacy. Totally forgettable movie once you leave the theatre. Only decent things are John majors and Michelle Pfeiffer. I'd say save your money wait the 45 days and watch on Disney+
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,should have been more scenes with Kang.  and modok.. that whole heart to heart scene should have been deleted.  there was a lot of wasted scenes.  the ending after Kang was killed was anti climatic
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the hate for the movie. It was awesome! Kang was SCARY! All the acting was great! Paul Rudd was great and Cassie was a great addition to the the MCU. The only problem I had with it was MODOK at the very end of the movie. Other than that, it was GREAT movie!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't listen to critics. It's a sensational beginning to the next phase.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ant Man And the Wasp Quantumania does a good job introducing Jonathan Majors Kang as the next MCU big villain but lazy writing and slow first act cant save the movie with Jonathan amazing performance. Amazing CGI and set desig. Paul Rudd and Kathryn Newton relationship in the movie was amazing. Overall not the MCU best not the worst. 6.5/10
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing and refreshing! Kang stole the show!!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Porq nerfearon al kang, osea no dur√≥ m√°s de una pel√≠cula, lo vencen con su ej√©rcito despu√©s de que dominaba todo el reino cu√°ntico, en un d√≠a, por el ant man que cay√≥ por error ah√≠, despu√©s de que kang espero tanto esta oportunidad. El kang que se supone era el m√°s mal de todos. :v por eso lo enviaron el consejo de cakngs, todo mal"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A perfect start and setup for phase 5!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really like the movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Phenomenal start of Phase 5! Cohesive pieces with quality pacing. Interested for what's to come.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome M.O.D.O.K was funny and a cool goofy arc as he should be. Kang was threatening I can't wait to see ymore. Hank and Janet were so enjoyable to watch and they were funny the jokes hit. Damn I don't know I just really enjoyed it I wish I could have seen  in imax but I may go back to watch it with my wife.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,fANTastic movie. Hilarious.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible first 1.5 hours. It finally speeds up, but it‚Äôs too late to recover from the bad acting, slow plot and ridiculous characters. The fat head bad guy is, hopefully, a joke, but I couldn‚Äôt tell. "
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely weird, but a fun mix of jokey and intense and Jonathan Majors deserves all the accolades Hollywood can bestow."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"La peor pel√≠cula de Marvel! Demasiados di√°logos y humor muy, muy flojo, poca acci√≥n. Perfecta para ir a dormir. Muy mal. La Fase 4 haci√©ndo todo mal!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow the critics missed big time on this one! I give it a 8/10. This was an excellent movie even if you're not a fan! Lots of complexities in this film and they were able to pull it off pretty good. Sure some parts were a bit slow or could have been better. But so is in EVERY movie! Majors was amazing as Kang! Now we know what is to come until Secret Wars!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's to faster I think if it's a close for scoot very bad y don't like it to much and the history it's mee‚Ä¶
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Really really good! Only edit I have would be the ending
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,What happened to these critics? Feels as though they are being paid to sabotage marvel! The movie is good and definitely worth watching! You can not listen to critics. Let real movie goers go in to critique these movies please‚Ä¶
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was fun. It was like if Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, John Carter, Strange World, and SAGA had a baby. A real fun Sci-Fi Adventure. Johnathan Majors as Kang is amazing and cannot wait to see him throughout this next phase of the MCU. The dynamic between Scott and Cassie was a highlight as was seeing Michelle Pfeiffer's as a major player in this film too. Downsides were some dialogue and unnecessary characters shoehorned in. Overall, see it. You'll have a blast. Quantumania gets an 85% B and a good start to the Multiverse Saga."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw the movie, Paul Rudd was funny and amazing as always. Jonathan Majors was a home run and can't wait to see him in the future films."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie to start phase 5 off Jonathan Majors, as kang was a great performance and the Ant family superb as usual."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know where the critics hate is coming from. Some dialogue is a bit lame, sure, but the film as a whole is a very fun adventure."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great special effects and funnier than i thought.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's a pretty good movie. Not one of the best in the mcu but far from the worst
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I laughed only once during MODOK's death scene.  The whole theatre was silent once the movie ended.  Kang was the best part of the movie but not enough to carry it.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great, Wholesome, Fun, Visually Stunning. 

Great storyline with an amazing set up in the end. wonderful way to truly bring forth Kang. He stole the show. Solid MCU movie that we haven't gotten since No Way Home."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Very epic and fun. No Luis minus one star.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"made me believe in Marvel again and want to see future movies, Kang is just fantastic and an extremely well-built villain"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Adventurous and funny!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exciting Fun Ride for those who grew up on comics. I will never lose the awe if seeing heroes on the big screen.  The pace quickly picks up toward the start and takes you on a ride through quantumania and the newest Marvel Big Villian. So many expected the same Ant-Man Story and crew, but this is an exciting new direction with the core being Scott's Family. Don't forget to hang out for the 2 End Credits Scenes."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Quantumania is the exact movie I hoped it'd be. Johnathan Majors is a revelation as Kang & will be menacing for years to come.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a decent start to phase 5 of the MCU. Jonathan Majors is incredible in the role of Kang the Conqueror. As for the rest of the cast, it's a pretty mixed bag. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang is fantastic as always. The only problem, is that much of him. Evangeline Lily as the Wasp, is pretty good, but similar to Paul Rudd, she's practically non existent in this movie, along with Michael Douglas as Hank Pym. The real stars of the show are, Kathryn Newton, as Scott Lang's daughter Cassie, and especially Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet. They are fine in their roles, but take the spotlight away from the better actors. Unlike most people, I personally don't mind the CGI landscape, but the visuals can be a bit iffy at times, especially Payton Reed returning as M.O.D.O.K. The worst part of the movie is that there isn't any consequences. You don't care about the new characters as much as the returning cast. Walking out of the movie, I didn't feel like anything changed. Marvel was hyping this up as a big event, but it didn't really land for me. The plot is pretty thin as with a lot of recent Marvel movies, but Kang as the villain has much more depth than most Marvel villains. This movie was pretty funny, and could put a smile on my face, it just wasn't anything special."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Paul Rudd is timeless as his everyman buffoon of a super hero, and I mean that as a compliment. His genuineness helps sell so much of this film, plus the absolute powerhouse that is Jonathan Majors. 
There are no bad actors here, but Jonathan Majors is Kang  and he sells the big bad well. while not as charming of a role as his Loki outing, this Kang is TERRIFYING. And terrifying are the implications of what is to come.
But back to our hero, Paul Rudd's Scott Lang continues to be the sweet man who can't believe that he is a hero, and now that he has it all, fame, love his daughter is terrified of losing it.

This is a solid film that might be trying to do too much, but despite the critics, still manages to hold onto it's heart. Honestly it's more of an 8/10 for me as far as Marvel movies go, but I felt it's been unduly hit by some reviewers, so I punched up my number for this rating."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fun and entertaining
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing details a creativity
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Something that I've missed from marvel movies. Purpose
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,it's not as exciting as you may think based on the trailer but it is a entertaining movie the 3D is a waste there's not much in it for that effect but if you're a fan of the MCU it is definitely worth watching and it opens the door to the next big thing coming to the MCU and the Avengers. Jonathan Majors as Kang is not as iconic or memorable as Thanos was in my opinion but he still is a really good villain and does a really good job in the role.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-man meets star wars with the Ant-man charm. Jonathan Majors as Kang is perfect and will be a great big bad for the future. First movie since Endgame to really move the overall plot of the MCU forward in a big way while still being at it's core an Ant-man movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ok 8.5 out of 10 really enjoyed it, idk what the bad reviews live about. Kang is awesome. I thought the jokes were awesome a couple of things were a little weird but overall really good movie. I will also add it had a slow start but it got really good. Some of the science doesn‚Äôt line up, but when does it when it comes to marvel movies. I really enjoyed this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,the movie i'ts not great but Kang introduction was amazing
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Only focuses on Kang! 
Straight forward movie. No wow moment happened while watching this film üé•"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,We enjoyed the movie so much!  Very action packed!  With some great funny moments. I can‚Äôt wait for one of the Memes to come out soon
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall an enjoyable movie. Jonathan Majors was the stand out actor. The CGI was a little excessive, and taking place completely in the Quantum Realm made the audience disconnect a bit, but I would still recommend.

It finally starts to connect other movies and shows, and gives a roadmap for the future, something they have been missing for a while."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It dragged on some parts but overall I enjoyed it very much.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I feel as though the movie is being review bombed by marvel fans who are wayyyyy too picky. This movie is fun, funny, beautiful, and has huge implications to the MCU. I never felt bored in the theatres & I definitley liked this more than some other marvel properties from recent memory."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"best, marvel movie we had in a while post credit scenes will blow you away"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great, fun addition to the MCU. Excited to see more of Kang."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I personally really enjoyed the movie. I don't really get the critics dislike.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Was solid didn‚Äôt drag on
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Many praise Jonathan Majors performance as Kang, and they're right, but he's the only part of this film that's interesting, and that isn't enough to validate its existence. In the end the MCU formula is more noticeable than ever."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The fact that this is getting a negative critic rating on Rotten is unbelievable, Kang is here to stay! Stop making Scott seem like an idiot"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,thought it was a very good movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was overall great. The pacing of the first 1/3rd of the movie felt a bit fast but it was still great. Both of the credit scenes were amazing. Between the movie and the scenes, it was a promising start to kick off Phase 5 and made me very excited to see everything tie together further into The Kang Dynasty."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I guess this is the MCU movie that everbody hates that I like. I liked the change in environment, and the interesting look of the Quantum realm with the interesting looking aliens, gave me a bit of a flashback the sacar in Thor Ragnarok. I liked that the stakes of this movie have been raised considerably. I feel like this film, mostly, had a good balence of when to be serious and when to have humor. I really enjoyed both Jonathan Majors as Kang and M.O.D.O.K even though I'm not thrilled with both of their conclusions in this movie. I thought the pacing wasn't great, but I did have a very enjoyable time with this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing! Some great lines delivered. 10/10 recommend
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Kang! Kang! Kang! And the two after credit scenes are worth it. The CGI was over the top and gave great depth to an emerging Quantum universe, however the plot is pretty basic. Michelle Pfeiffer gave a solid acting job, but we needed more Kang time and destruction. I still recommend you go see it, as this is a fantastic opening film for Marvel's Phase 5."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Okayish! Good action but wasn‚Äôt as dark as expected!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing start to phase five. Kang is already a top 3 mcu villain.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I created an account just to review this movie. I do not think the critics and I were watching the same movie with the low score they gave this movie. It is a unique action comedy built to start an epic journey in the MCU. If you truly give yourself to this movie, you will find a heart warming story between a father and his daughter. They do their best to make this movie a standalone movie for people who have not seen the other two, but you wouldn't expect star wars episode 6 to make sense without watching 4 or 5 would you? Epic villain, hilarious comic relief hero, and a story with a heart. The CGI was cleaned up and looked really good compared to what was seen in the trailer. Everything is so serious these days... Just go and have a good time watching a movie and go be entertained for 2 hours instead of letting critics ruin it for you like they have started to for me."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Can't go wrong with Michelle Pfeiffer, she has a much bigger role in this one. Kang is great."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,it was a good standard marvel action movie a bit of a Mary sue complex for the teenager kid and i don't know why Hollywood likes to portray the girls as strong independent but they come over as a bit of C's or B's like in star wars i know whats wrong but i cant tell u yet if they would be like normal people they could have prepared better... and 1 seen dedicated to the abc mob easily edited out for china other than that it was a standard old marvel movie good action seens a cool tiny world but they cant get off the time travel back so its hard to follow... if the bad guy controls time..... i assume he is the next thanos 100% better than thor and dr strange the bad guy was actually evil
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!! The plot was very interesting. Spoilers ahead‚Ä¶.Kang is amazing. Jonathan Majors nails the role and gives it his all. The dialogue at certain points doesn't really come across right. The pacing is good. Didn't really feel like an Ant-Man film. It felt like a prequel to Avengers: The Kang Dynasty mixed with 2010's sci-fi. The only part of this movie I personally had a problem with was how cheesy Modok was. His character felt wasted. Other than that this movie was really great and I would highly recommend it.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie.. could have had more kang!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great opening for phase 5....
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie I've seen in 2023. Incredibly fun, light hearted. Didn't feel like 2 hours long. Incredible performances from all cast members but Looooved Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd in this! Definitely recommend and will be watching again!üëèüèæüëèüèæ"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining- nice balance of humor and action. Sets up the future MCU
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action, funny and sets up new movies and tv.  I will see again in the theater.  Critics are dead wrong!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I‚Äôm not a marvel movie fan, but I do like Ant-man movies because I like Paul Rudd. I enjoyed the first two, but this one was way to Syfy for my liking."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it ü•∞ super funny.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is visually stunning, has great family themes and emotions, and Kang is incredible. And‚Ä¶the ants showed up!! My daughter and I loved this movie. It's incredible sci-fi and family fun!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Personally loved this movie more than the first 2. Laughed so hard I cried 4 times, loved how they handled MODOK, given he's an extremely hard character to attempt to do live action, and of course Kang himself. I can see why the audience scores on this are so drastically different than the critics scores: us real fans don't care that it's not as funny and leans more toward being dark and serious. We don't care that it doesn't connect to many other MCU properties. We don't care that Bill Murray was only in a couple of scenes. This movie has gotten me even MORE hyped for this Saga."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie that's not too long and not too short. Great mix of serious moments and humour that makes the audience invest even more in the characters. Kang, as an ongoing villian, is perfectly established for moviegoers both familiar and unfamiliar with the character. Great visual effects wrap it all up in a nice bow."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie with lots of emotion. The perfect start to this year‚Äôs mcu line up
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie and the cgi was wild and post-credit scenes were interesting and left me wanting to see more and how it will play out in the next few movies
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was stupid. Corny jokes plus terrible cgi
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible CGI, especially in IMAX 3D. The amount of critics complaining about the CGI really irks me. While there is still some uncanny valley going on, graphics have some such a long way. This is the kind of movie comic artists could only dream about 50 years ago, or even 20 years ago with Phantom Menace. The oddities inhabiting the quantum realm are straight up gorgeous at times, looking like a live-action Rick and Morty space episode (I mean that in the best way possible).

That said, one particular character's CGI was unsettling and awkward. Given that he was also a returning character whose legacy was undercut for comedic relief, the movie would have been better without him. If you've seen the film, you'll know exactly who this is.

Kang was not this person. Kang was great in Loki and he's even better here. Can't wait to see more variants of him.

If you enjoy MCU films in general, Quantumania is probably the best movie they've made since Shang-Chi. It finally feels like the MCU is building up to something again."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kant should‚Äôve been more dominant
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was Great! Yes there was a little bit of CGI issues with MODOK but nothing that can't be overlooked at an entire universe with characters created in this movie.  If you wall away complaining about CGI over MODOK l - you weren't paying attention to the movie. Overall amazing - if there was a character plot flaw it with Janet Van Dyne and the sidestepping of questioning of Quantum realm. A little bit more dialogue would have helped that move along.
Go Watch the Movie - Have Fun and Enjoy the journeys"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"An amazing spectacle set in a visually remarkable and distinct universe. A cohesive and entertaining story especially within the context of the genre, with a ton of Easter eggs and dna service for comic fans. It sets up what's to come really nicely. I'm starting to believe professional reviewers have lost contact with reality. If its drifts too far from the formula it's garbage, if it cuts too close to the formula it's garbage. It's boldly moves away from the source material it's trash, if it's too close to the source it's trash. Honestly it feels like nothing can win and it's exhausting."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. Must watch
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"SPOILER!!!! I myself enjoyed the movie and everything about it except the 3 act of the movie. I personally think the direction they went with would‚Äôve been better had they actually killed Ant-man. It would‚Äôve been a great proper send off for our hero Ant-man, and it could‚Äôve send a serious tone going forward with phase 5 that this new threat (Kang) is more dangerous than Thanos had he killed Ant-man. Overall it still a fun and exciting movie and a good start for the new MCU sage."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors displayed and did a massive debut for Kang. He just didn't owned the role. He conquered it!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Saw it and liked it; good setup for phase 5. Going to be a lots of Kangs in the future.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,My favorite Ant-Man movie. Go see it!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was well done and a lot of fun. It was a good blend of story and entertainment. Much better written than some things that have come out in the last year or two. Not one of the top marvel movies, but still worth the watch. Lots of building blocks for what is to come in the MCU. At first I was wondering if this was too big of a threat for Ant-Man, but the way they handled it was pretty well done. Sure there are a few nit picks, but I think people are harder on the marvel movies than they would be any other movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Cassie Lang is here! I love how much they let Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer shine in this! I do think it's time for Cassie to takeover in Ant-Man 4. Let's do Ant-Man and The Stinger. Please?
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't love it but I didn't hate it.  It was a good movie.  I agree with others that it's an MCU Star Wars, including rebel alliance, helmeted villain, hood disguises and bar scene.  A little melodramatic but it's fine.  I would have liked less action and more plot.  MODOK was absolutely ridiculous.  He went through an identity crisis, midlife crisis, and story arc in just a few scenes while adding some obscure comic relief.   Kang, by far the most intimidating and unbelievable villain of the MCU yet.  There's a lot going on in this film that you're almost a bit overwhelmed to form an opinion on it.  Again not my favorite but not deserving of the low tomato Score the main critics gave it.  I think an unbelievably high bar of expectations has been set that the critics struggle to just enjoy these films for what they are‚Ä¶.   Entertainment."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Love how this movie included all the characters
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Visual delight! Epic adventure!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great Marvel movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome and amazing üëåüèΩ
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action but also very dark.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The second best ant-man movie, the post-credits were phenomenal, Kang is one of, if not the best villain Marvel has ever had, all the jokes landed, and paul rudd did a great job as usual"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"its a great movie to start phase 5 of marvel. happy to see everyones effort shown in this film, especially of jonathan major. my favourite villian of all time. i recommend you to see this film."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"hilarious, fun action, good callbacks. awesome visuals."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I prefer my earth based hero's to have mostly grounded adventures Not some hippy, psychedelic voyage to trip out city, with limited plot, character development. Hope looked liked she'd aged 20 years since the last movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining, fun, special effects were good, but there was too many fighting scenes and not much of s story."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was fine!  Entertaining ""popcorn"" movie!  Different than other MCU movies.  Critics are being too harsh for some reason."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,good step on the next phase of marvel
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is a must-see film for those who love superhero and sci-fi movies. This is the sequel to the Ant-Man series and it's great that Quantumania not only delivers amazing action scenes, but also brings deep emotions and surprises for the audience. The film features talented actors, especially the return of Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne. In addition, Quantumania also requires the audience to concentrate on the introduction of concepts related to the universe and time, but the clear explanations will help the viewers easily understand and immerse themselves in the colorful and surprising world of the film. Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is a work full of new ideas, along with exciting plot twists, that really satisfies the audience after watching it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-man ant the wasp quantumania es una gran pel√≠cula ,es genial no puedes dejar de verla se las recomiendo en mi opini√≥n fue una de las mejores pel√≠culas de ant man,tiene un buen villano que es Kang en mi parecer es una pel√≠cula art√≠stica"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Visual effects were crazy
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, entertainment value was good, the plot is interesting, obviously will have to involve again all available avengers"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a decent start to Phase 5. The tone shifted from the last two films. With a little bit of comic relief in between. However, the threat of Kang The Conqueror is not to be trifled with. At first I thought why introduce Kang in an Ant Man Movie. It works. Because what we know on whats coming in a few years, this was on one version of him. One thing i can take away is that the Modok CGI was atrocious and scared the kids in the theater. Overall this is a must see!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania was alright. I liked it. It was fun and enjoyable. But it‚Äôs not great. As a fan of the Marvel movies I‚Äôm glad I sat down to watch it and stayed for the extra scenes. I There are two post credit scenes. All in all, I gave it 3 stars."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some of the acting by the side main characters are a bit stale but other then that movie is freaking amazing. Visuals are really nice asw, not going to lie they toned down the Ant-Man shrink and growing like how I‚Äôm the first movie you felt how small he shrunk, but in this it‚Äôs just off a bit but you can get past it."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Majors as Kang is the best part of this film. The VFX for the first half of the movie is half-baked and too murky for my liking, but the latter portion is solid entertainment, especially when Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer are in the picture."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,A great opener and episode 1 to phase 5. Could have closed out the trilogy a little bit better but overall was enjoyable to watch and it gives a good picture of where marvel is headed over the next few years.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. Well written. Action pack family hilarious
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I personally enjoyed this movie. 

Not sure why others didn't enjoy it. It flowed well. kept the story simple and gave us a taste of what the old movies were like. 

Jonathan Majors is a tremendous actor. I very much enjoyed his performance above all else."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,You must watch!! Great family movie
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"#AntManAndTheWaspQuantumania is a good one, definitely not the best Marvel movie yet the best Ant Man, revolves around Scott and Cassie drew parallels with the story of Janet and Hope. 
ONE WORD : MOVIE IS WHOLESOME WITH ACTION AND A GOOD STORY TO VILLAIN AND SIDE CHARACHTERS.
MODOK is definitely added to my wasted character list hoped it to be fierce but Kang is the ultimately shown on the film. The movie sure give vibe of Star Wars franchise. Giving a happy ending to story make you feel wholesome at the end. The cast has done their best especially Jonathan Majors. Major's Kang is what most will be talking about but make sure ""to look for the little guy"". Hank's role at the end, felt satisfying though. Volume technology affected as friend turned foe, initial scenes are wonderful"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Heck yeah! GREAT movie. The  critics are so dumb. CGI was not bad at all and story was darker, but the trailer made that clear. I wish they'd have done a bit more comedy and maybe more goofy stuff in the Quantum Realm, but it was not a bad movie by any stretch."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente pel√≠cula, siento que muchos esperaban mas, pero hay que recordar que solo es el comienzo de lo que se viene."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I mediocre entry in the MCU, Kang is a great villain and brings a confidence that recent films in the MCU have lacked."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I really liked this movie! It felt like the natural progression of the Ant-Man while also setting up the next big chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was a weird story and suffered from some pacing problems at times, but I enjoyed the weirdness and humor. More than other Marvel movies I think this works as a standalone movie that you don't need to have seen everything for it to make sense. For that reason and my overall enjoyment I would recommend it!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,George Lopez from Spy Kids was good in this one
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a ton of fun!! Ignore the critics who have made themselves irrelevant.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,well done by Kevin feige again
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Strong start to the movie lined up with the other Ant-Man movies with the fun Scott we know and we love which was great, but than it took a nose dive with how they handle the whole experience with the quantum realm and Kang. Look how serious Scott was about his daughter but than they all go around this place throwing jokes around and most of them didn't land well and felt to force they just didn't find the rhythm to the movie was it to be taken like a joke or seriously. I will say this movie is still a great watch with the actors of Kang (Jonathan Majors) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) with this storyline and visual it still made it a pleasant watch."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It Felt like watching a Star Wars movie , it was fun ."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, had the comedy and serious moments needed to be a good start to new phase."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great. Loved every frame of it. Especially the Beauty of marvel shown in it. A perfect start to Phase 5, despite Critic's low ratings, I would suggest you to Visit theaters to experience 2 hours of fun and entertainment."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good entertainment but that‚Äôs about it.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great opening movie for Marvel‚Äôs phase 5
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what movie the critics watched.  This was fun, engrossing, captivating and kept you engaged the entire time.  Start to finish this was the best Marvel movie since Endgame.  If the rest of Phase 5 is like this, then we are in for another wild ride, and it explains why Phase 4 was so lackluster."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The Ant-Man movies were my favorite Marvel movies. This one was very disappointing. Couldn't figure out if I was watching a Star Wars film during many scenes. CGI was very lacking in quality. Marvel needs to up their game, they are getting sloppy. Very cheesy dialog, and bad screenwriting. I am so bummed..."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Lets just say ant-man meets clone-wars then has a Pixar baby . Non stop action after credits not to bad not really missing anything
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,So good 10 out of 10. I held my pee just to finish this
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Loved the first 2/3rds of the movie, not super happy with the ending. Lots of cool an creative ideas and better than some of what Marvel has been putting lately."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,just a good fun movie üçø
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,End credits pur√©e golddddddddd
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang the Conqueror was the best part
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This is by far the best one out of the three Ant-Man movies in my opinion. I wish they would have added more footage of Janet's time back home. I think that would have really helped with the characters building.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great. Will say most of the ""critic"" reviews are truly just not growing with the new technology and generation that is coming into the film industry."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Got it, get it, good."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Way to much CGI. Felt like we were just watching people in from of a fake back drop. Just really missed the mark.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. Don‚Äôt listen to the critics on this one!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun filler to get Kang started. Jonathan Majors is fabulous. Loved the after credit scene! Far better than critics glove credit here. 
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,A little long. Obviously action and graphics were good. Tired of most of the jokes in these movies. Just becoming a repeating theme. Paul Rudd is nice to look at.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't under the 48 percent score.. this move was great!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,4/5 solid way to bring in the next phase of marvel movies.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Was an amazing movie
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is not as good as the audience score indicates, but it's MUCH better than the critic's score. The first act is good. The second act is decent. The third act is just a bunch of cgi fights, but there's enough laughs to recommend. I certainly wasn't disappointed, as I was with Strange2 and Thor4 and if we compare it's to phase 2, this is certainly better than Iron Man 3."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought it was quite good. 

Yes, it's very much a Marvel movie and it's difficult not to see similar beats from the other billion Marvel movies. But for a Marvel movie, it was quite good. What they've been saying about Majors is true. The comedic bits didn't ruin the epic moments they are sprinkled into, but not for me. Like VFX, humor hasn't been Marvel's strong suit lately (more on that later), but Peyton Reed keeps things fresh in this much bigger story. The depiction of MODOK is the only thing that seemed to have a little too much screen time. A top critic said the movie was ""dull"". Are we watching the same movie? I think if anything, due to the weirdness of the quantum realm and some of its seemingly countless life forms, there is going to be a few inevitable comparisons to Rick and Morty or Adventure Time. But that's fine. This bizarro aesthetic of the quantum realm originates in the comic books, which were first. Right? Bill Murray shouldn't have done this film, but I don't hate him in his role, either. It's just that turning down these kinds of roles is what makes him so likable and seeing him here is a bit crushing. Nobody is talking much about how they paid Janet Van Dyne's character back big time for being a set piece in the previous two movies. Pfeiffer is given a lot to do in this film and she does great, especially in her scenes with Majors. Also, I noticed a great character arc for Hank Pym. He changes quite a bit throughout Douglas' different depictions of him and it's nice to seem him not just going all grouchy every time the camera is turned to him. Everyone is given a bit of story here, which balances the movie nicely as it flips between separated parties throughout large chunks of the film. The VFX were great. A nice bounce back from the Marvel TV shows of late (remember She-Hulk's business suit? yikes). There's a scene where some characters are mirrored and multiplied, which was the only distractingly 'not good' VFX in a virtual ocean of great VFX. People say that the movie is long. Maybe, but I didn't feel it drag until a couple of recurring jokes began to feel tired (Baskin Robins). And I had no problem spending a little more time getting to know the quantum realm and its inhabitants. It adds a little weight to that epic plot, where the stakes are an eked victory for Paul Rudd and Co. or certain doom for the quantum realm and, of course, the entire universe/multiverse/whatever. Yes, it's very much a Marvel film.

Overall though, it was quite good."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,What a great movie and a outstanding introduction to the Kang Dynasty. Love it from beginning to end.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a great time with this movie, a few nitpicks but nothing that would drive the score down for me. Ready for more KANG."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Really dope !! Will be seeing it more than once
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I feel like it was mid. I love marvel and have my whole life, the only part of this movie that held it together was Paul Rudd. Kang felt to easy( that variant). I really wasn't worried about the outcome of the movie while watching."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,The only positive I can give this is how funny it was..not on purpose tho I was laughing because of how dumb it was
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best P4 movies with some laughs.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,a good entertaining movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie had a lot of action and was funny.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"There is a super cool, very exciting cameo that I didn't expect.  The movie was surprisingly very good.  I'd read so many articles that no one cares about Ant Man.  They should it's a great story.... Jonathan Majors ya'll.  Assemble!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"You will not enjoy this movie if you know nothing about marvel, like the critics on this site."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Meh it passed the time sums it up perfectly.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the entire film.  Was a fantastic sequel to the others and the generation concept is GREAT Looking forward to seeing the daughter Cassie taking a more active role in the future.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is definitely underrated. Sure it has a few flaws like being rushed, Kang being weak and poor written jokes. But other than that I really enjoyed the movie. It was far better than Ant-Man and Wasp and almost as good as Ant-Man in my opinion. It doesn't deserve a 48% rotten tomato score, it was far better the 1/10 movie Eternals."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Spent more time laughing AT this movie than with it. But I still had a good time watching the new Marvel flick. Kang was fantastic, Michelle Pfeiffer was great, Humpty Dumpty was horrible. And a couple of good scenes sprinkled throughout (and post credits), but overall it‚Äôs a forgettable movie. Here‚Äôs hoping phase 5 gets better."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is an adventure well-worth the 2 hour run-time. This was a great way to introduce Kang and phase 5, with a lovable Avenger from the Infinity Saga."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it! Ignore the critics. Rotten Tomatoes is garbage. See it for yourself and come back here and leave a review.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,The setting was as expected. The fight scenes near the end were pretty great. Definitely stay for the end credit scene.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great movie definitely better than what the critics say. Go see it for yourself. 7.5 out of 10
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie again by Marvel
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Nowhere near as bad as some people are saying. It‚Äôs fluffier than it should be but overall it was a lot of fun.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is fricking AMAZING its so visually stunning, the humor is literally on POINT and the best part yet the story is immaculate. DO NOT LISTEN to critics they are BLIND."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,So fun! Jonathan Majors steals every scene he's in. Definitly not like the other two Ant Man films in the MCU as it's on a much bigger scale than just San Francisco and fighting evil businessmen. Go see it and you'll laugh a lot!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was fun!  It also makes total sense in the context of the ongoing MCU adaptation of the marvel comic book stories.  Acting was good. It was funny. No it wasn't in SF, it was in an imaginary land so sorry professional reviewers that there was so much CGI.  ‚Ä¶"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a great movie, gave more insight on the quantum relm along with information on Kang. I also thought while modok kinda creeped me out he was a pretty funny character overall and lastly with Mobious and Loki it the end credit scence made it all the better."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a very fun movie. Who knows what movie the critics saw, but this is worth it. Soo many laughs and soo much fun."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a good movie sadly the 4D did not work in the theatre I was in
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang couldve been a little stronger than shown
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining! Setting the foundation of the next big baddie to take on the Avengers!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lighthearted and fun, very enjoyable. Not going to win an Oscar but worth the trip to the theater. Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors were both fantastic."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie. Seeing how big of a threat Kang is was so good to see! The Pym and Lang family dynamic was so good to see. And some of the changes that they made for certain characters makes sense with how the MCU is set up so far. I will say it had a lot going on but I enjoyed it.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun movie! It's basically if Star Wars were a Marvel movie in the best ways. The world building was great and I can't get enough of Kang.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Professional critics don't understand comic book movies. This movie was great. Well paced. The story was good and is a great introduction to Kang. Very good acting and gorgeous scenery. The 3-D is worth it. Very few slow points. One mid-credit and one post credit scene that are exciting must sees.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Best Marvel showing since Spider Man No way home
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was much better than I thought it would be, but ugly CGI and very non-memorable creatures. Some good jokes. Kang was good and wish he was in it more. Movie was much better than Thor Love&Thunder and Dr Strange MoM. But, nowhere as good as Wakanda Forever. Will probably see again. A 7/10 for me."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was lifeless. The movie sets up Kang as a formidable villain, but the post credit scene looked so jarring, if this is where Kang's story is heading, I am not interested."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was funny, fast paced, right length, combination  of humor and seriousness against villain along with taking time to connect the story lines.

Good movie to see

Rotton Tomatoes need new assessors"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Graphically beautiful and thoroughly entertaining!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Perioooooodt! That's all I can say. The film is entertaining and the visuals are beautiful.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Villain seemed sad. Craved limes-def a bonus
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie and my 11-year-old grandson especially liked it.  Saw it on the grand screen.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Gives me what I want everytime.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics were too harsh on this movie. Went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised ! Modok‚Ä¶.was something‚Ä¶ but he had his moments. Moved at a fast pace and kept me engaged the entire time. Kang was awesome ! Stoked for the next phase of the MCU !
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this new comic book movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best YET FOR ANT MAN
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Had funny moments. Didn't live up to previous movies. I fell asleep twiceüò¥
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it was fun, a bit too heavy on the comedy, but action and kang is awesome! Quantum realm part is the best star wars movie since episode VI. Definitely over-hated, Critics are wrong, it‚Äôs no masterpiece, but if you want a good time with interest in where the mcu is going with kang, come watch"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just finished watching it and I want to know what these critics were on! IT WAS AMAZING! 

First, for a 2 hour movie, it felt longer and had so much to offer and I loved every minute of it! The VFX was great (except for MODOK) and visually pleasing.

Continuing on, this film at the heart of it was still an Ant-Man film and I loved that it had that as the foundation. Paul Rudd once again kills it and he's always a delight! Kathryn Newton was amazing as Cassie and I loved how they delivered her hero origin story.

Now let's talk about Kang The Conqueror! Jonathan Majors kills it! He's the best villain the MCU has had in a while and I honestly was satisfied. I had no words when he appeared on screen. He was phenomenal.

I loved the story + post credits scenes, the set-up, and pacing. One thing I'm iffy on was MODOK. He was a good character but was he truly needed for the story? I guess it probably was for the sake of completing the trilogy but he felt like comedic relief. That's my one negative.

My final rating: 4.5 Stars

The critics did not do justice to this movie. They had me worried for no reason. This movie is probably my favorite Ant-Man film (couple rewatches will define that later on)  and honestly, might be Top 10 for me. Go watch it everyone! Enjoy it!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think the special effects were really good and Micheal Douglas and Michelle Phiefer were good  but the movie had a lot of holes.  The script was not that good and it felt like Disney put parts of Star Wars and Dune into the mix.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had a few issues with Cassie and some of the cheesy moments which were tough but overall a great movie with a fantastic plot and very good structure. Jonathan Majors KILLED it as Kang. If you're a marvel fan you'll like it, don't ever trust rotten tomatoes critics."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Stunningly beautiful and entertaining!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The best way to start the next phase!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun Marvel romp through a fun sci-fi world! Made me nostalgic for Robert Rodriguez movies.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fantastically written character driven story line with a great mix of funny and emotional moments and a stacked cast with Jonathan Majors and Kathryn Newton really shining.
The special effects were extremely well done about 85% of the time"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is visually spectacular and i loved every moment. The best movie to kick off phase 5 and kang is sicküî•.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is an EXPERIENCE!  Action packed, trippy, humorous, and consequential.  The Ant Fam was great, but Jonathan Majors absolutely killed it as Kang and left me wanting more Kang!  The MCU is so back."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely hilarious and action packed.  Great movie!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!! The mix of seriousness and comedy was PERFECT! Rudd nails it again! The whole cast was awesome! A must watch and a must-own for my blu-ray collection!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the new Star Wars! I was shocked when they started flying! IDK who Scott is, or why there were ants, but I'm glad they got Bill Murray to reprise his role as Emperor Palpatine.

Sad there were no Skywalkers, but I liked the new guys nonetheless. My only quarrel with the film is that the Snoke head died."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was pretty decent although it could‚Äôve been way better than what it was. A disappointing start to Marvels phase 5 indeed.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is by far the worst marvel movie ever made . If you go into it with an open mind and assume its a comedy, you will absolute love it. It is so bad its great but not in a good way. In an impressively bad way. How can you spend 200 million dollars and get this.  Seriously, me and my nephews have been laughing for 45 minutes."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"pretty decent film overall, if a bit long"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun, but not Marvels best."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie overall, ending was just a lil too fast paced."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it. I saw it in IMAX 3D and it really did the movie justice with the special fx. There were multiple plot holes but I went into the movie anticipating that with a 2hr5min run time. But overall the pacing was fine and it was pretty funny at times. Johnathan Majors needed some more screen time because he was amazing.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was great. Well balanced humor with action. Great introduction to phase 5.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was everything I wanted it to be. I enjoyed it from start to finish.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel made a better Star Wars than ""Lucasfilm"" did in the past 20yrs.
Quantum Realm felt new, the creatures were a nice ""freshen up"" since we got a bit stale with all the super heroes. 
Nice to see Kang and a taste of where this is all going to go. 
Not too much forced humor like the last THOR movie, but natural comedy...
Definitely a good start to Phase 5."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I thought it had potential to be a good movie, but it had bad CGI in parts, a ridiculous last 30-40 minutes, and a villain that should have felt like more of a threat.  Very disappointing movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a fun balance of the usual Ant-Man humor, with a massive step up in visuals and fright with the entrance of Kang.  It is obviously a starting point for many future encounters with Kang in Phase 5, but I really enjoyed the nostalgic feel of what I consider to be MCU's Star Wars homage."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"√â um bom filme, bobinho mas bom... Da pra se divertir."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"First 20 minutes of the movie was kinda boring and slow, but the rest of the movie was good. Good CGI as always, good resolution and good villian. Loved the family thing going on, one of the best of the fase 4 marvel movies, but nothing amazing."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics lawde pe bcüòÇ
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a fun filler movie.
Action scenes were good.
Liked all the different characters.
Kang was good..menacing."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't get the tomato meter ratings, this movie was fire."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"After a lot of grasping at what was left after Endgame, Ant-Man 3 is a great step in the right direction for the MCU since Loki."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the hell out of this movie, perfect start to phase 5, Majors was fantastic, the movie looked stunning"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Liked Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors. Plot was convoluted and poorly written. Attempts at humor fell flat. Not up to previous Marvel standards.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The actors were amazing on there roles lang was phenomenal
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The first half of the movie was pretty good. Majors works as Kang, even with a weak script. Michelle Pfeiffer was definitely one of the stand outs. The humour was well balanced. However the final act of the movie is a complete mess with plot holes all over the place."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,good cinematics and continuing plot line for ant man
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I disliked the final fight and also how Louis wasnt in the film
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This may be one of the most overhated movies I've ever heard of
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a good Ant-man movie. Better than expected. The movie didn't try too hard to be funny, plot was good and also moved the overall universe plot. I enjoyed it."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,So bad we left the theater. I havent left a movie since Joe vs The Volcano.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The best out of all of the ant-man movies. Highly recommend.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are dumb and worthless. Their opinions shouldn't ever be considered.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great setup for the Marvel future.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Two extras after movie!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think marvel did a disservice to show how truly powerful Kang really is Ant-Man should had died in the film
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best marvel movie since Spider-Man no way home . Kang is a bad mother****** . Movie also manages to be a good third movie in a Ant man trilogy bringing elements of past installments together without force . It‚Äôs nice to see seriousness and real danger for characters back in a marvel movie
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,The 3rd installment in the Ant-Man saga is a fun and entertaining adventure for the family
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie lived up to the hype for me. All I saw were negative reviews going into this movie but I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was hilarious and suspenseful. Kang was amazing as well. Can't wait for Avengers Kang Dynasty!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,i think it was a great storyline. Makes me more excited to see future shows and movies. Great job picking jonathon Majors. Paul killed it as always. way to go Marvel.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Some characters were underdeveloped/under utilized (Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas).  Some shined bright (Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors).  The Wasp in the movie title really was Michelle Pfeiffer.  Although good, not great.  Will need a rewatch to see if I missed anything.  Liked the end credit set up."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in with realistic expectations also I knew it was a heavy cgi movie and more of a sci-fi flick. That being said Kang is the truth. We really enjoyed it. I'm also aware some didn't but to each their own. I have it a 8/10 but thought it was a high 7 so I round it up lol. It's a worthy 3rd installment to the franchise. The only real complaint I have was the cgi on MODOK. Still a great start to phase 5. 
Also stay for the 2 post credits"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,KANG was amazing. I Can't wait to see the Future of Phase 5 üí™üèº
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"ok, rotten tomatoes got this rating wrong. it was the best ant man movie to rate and a first hand look at an awesome story to come. sorry thor lovers, love and thunder did 0 to achieve that.
I know modok in the comics was created by A.I.M. but the mcu has to make certain creative changes to fit their narrative.  using what happened to yellowjacket from ant man 1 was the perfect way to do that and simply made sense. 
Kang was perfectly portrayed, right down to his powers and menace. comic lovers will love his shield ability. a throwback to the old comics. this movie is thoroughly enjoyable."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ok now I do not want to just hate on it because I usually do like marvel movies. Used to be a big fan and now more casual watcher, but god this was not that good. Like the dynamic between the main Pym and Lang families are well written but it just felt so long and just like a lot of cgi filler. Also,,, a certain character I cannot take seriously because of the effects used on them. Couldn't stop laughing with my sibling."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A wholesome, wacky, weird fun vibes thoroughly enjoyed it. Kang and Janets performances really stood out as great! A great kick off to the next phase!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its not a perfect movie and not any movie was is or will
But I enjoy the movie very much
Post credit scenes are mind blowling
I fully recommend to all to watch in IMAX 3D

"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A very well done and mind bending experience. Will prove to be a pivotal point and installment. Loved it!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good. I like how M.O.D.O.K. Is connected and the origin of Kang is nicely explained even more from Loki (season 1).
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Its not as bad as critic say!  Its a good movie.  I could easily watch it!  Jonathan Major is amazing!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thought the movie was very good. CGI was next level. The Quantum realm is a masterpiece. Beautifully done. I wish they did a better job with Evangeline Lilly's Wasp and Kathryn Newton's Cassie characters? Wasp was so much better in the previous 2 installments, and Cassie was not great. Everything else was great. I do wish MODOK was used a little differently as well. He was good, but could have been great. Too much comic relief in the end."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are a joke. Disregard those clowns. This movie was fantastic. The front half was a bit average at first, but once it hit a certain point, which I won't spoil, it became an 8.5 or 9/10 at least. If this is what Phase 5 looks like, these are some golden years we're entering."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Come the conqueror!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"My son and I enjoyed the new antman movie, actors were great, and of course lots of actions."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kaaaaang! He gave us a glimpse of what's to come and just enough here. There was just enough humor.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great start to Phase 5!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Hyped for the next avengers movie
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I rlly enjoyed. Kang was amazing Modak was funny and lots of Humour rhst didn't feel too forced highly recommend it's not great but good I give it 7:7/10
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Thought it was dumb.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought it was alright. It seemed mostly about Janet VanDyne. Kinda hard to keep up with, probably better with a second watch to catch everything. It wasn't to bad."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing!! Freaking awesome!!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Didn't add anything to the story we already knew about for example other Kangs
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid Marvel movie. Not good, But way better then phase 4."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Esto es antman... no vengadores! Buena pelicula.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved bad Azz KANG!!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors killed it as Kang! He definitely made the movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Super good movie and set up very well the beginning of phase 5 as well as what kind of bad guy Kang will ultimately become along the way!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. Critics are being too harsh. It was fun, good action. Great casting for Kang by JM. Could it have been more serious? Yes. Could it have been better effects? Sure. But it was good nonetheless."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Delivers a good laugh for sure.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As a film it was really good. But as a mcu film, it was another disappointment. But I recommend it for everyone. Happy watching."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Another world is successfuly created in Ant Man & the Wasp the world had a Star Wars feeling and to care about all beings if they struggle against evil.  Plus I love the Pym/ Van Dyne family dynamic.  I took my 11 year old daughter and we had a blast!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't care about the criticism from the so-called ""critics"" on Rotten Tomatoes.  These supposed ""critics"" should be ""tremendous"" consultants saying how they want the movie to be.  That is why I have not taken and never will take the criticisms of the ""critics"" of the cinema into consideration.  The movie is well made and Jonathan Mayors looked impressive in his role as Kang, The Conqueror."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,DON'T BELIEVE WHAT THE CRITICS SAY ON ROTTEN TOMATOES. NEED TO WATCH TO IT TO SEE HIW THEY SET THE STAGE FOR AVENGERS: THE KANG DYNASTY
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another disjointed Marvel entry... Nothing seems to flow, the pacing is awful and it wound up being a stack of random things happening with no explanation or character development. The attempts at humour are cringe and completely take away from the tone the movie was trying to achieve... It was Marvel's last chance with me and I am officially done with the MCU"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, entertaining, and comic book themed!! Great family movie. "
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was funny without trying to be. And I really enjoyed seeing the whole family be a part of the film and their chemistry. And everyone was badass and It had some pretty good action and overall a fun marvel movie. Definitely a fun ride.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know what critics were thinking this movie is surprising good. Not the best mcu movie. But A MUST SEE!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not as good as I hoped. Too much special effects, not enough storytelling. Felt like watching a streaming show with overdone special effects- not like watching a good movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,funny good plot and action
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Has to be seen on the big screen! Wish I saw it in 3D. 

2 post credit scenes so stay till the end."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Buena pel√≠cula , una pel√≠cula de Ant man en su linea   Kang impresionante"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very few fight seens.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'd recommend watching but the plot development wasn't there. Jonathan Majors as Kang was great. The movie, like the rest of the MCU is missing the story building that made everyone invest in the avengers movies and the movies leading up to them."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,So weird! It so cool to explore the Quantum realm. Super funny and Jonathan Majors is an Avenger's level threat!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,A lot of special effects but didn‚Äôt care for the storyline.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang was the only highlight of the movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved everything & the 4dx theater made it even better.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While everyone praised Jonathan Majors - obviously he just simply is amazing - Michelle Pfeiffer performance blew me away! Her actions sequences, silence but intense moments, coolness attitude , she is this mysterious HERO out-of-time‚Ä¶! 
The movie should have been called Ant-Man and The WaspS. 

The MCU humor is still a bit TOO much - as this become a pattern in recent Marvel movies - especially for international audiences. 
Some much stuff is just NOT Funny at all. 
If you are not American or didn't grew up in the US, you can't enjoyed those jokes. 
And I know this is American production based on American comics material but when movie relies a lot on international box-office - we, as international audiences, misses most of the silly jokes and references. 

Shout out to Kang, thanks to Jonathan Major incredible performance - this actor is redefining acting in so many ways - any actors facing Kang in future Marvels projects better level their acting performance!!!  
But I would have hope to see an stronger version of him - I mean this is Kang THE CONQUEROR. 

Last words: although I am surprised by the low RT, GO And See that MOVIE! You'll have fun, even, if you are not a Marvel fan - 
This movie can be watch as a stand-alone movie - out of space and time of the MCU - although it brings some much tease for what's coming in the future of the MCU. 
And if you are a MCU fan, make sure to stay until the end for 2 amazing post-credit scenes!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie was fantastic!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the hate. Great movie, fun storylines, many laugh out loud moments! Music was great too. Awesome cast. Watch it :)"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's better than critics were saying it was. Go in without trying to compare it to the other Ant Man movies and it's pretty good. It's funny because it's a big change in direction, and a lot of people are saying that it strips Ant Man of everything that made it special, only I remember when those original two Ant Man reviews came out how they were saying it was just ""fluff"" and not as good as the others. It's so hard to please people. Does everything work in the movie? No. MODOK is really hard to look at, and there are some lines that are too quirky. But it's cool to look at and fun and weird, and the MCU is best when it gets weird with stuff."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Middle part felt rushed and original. End fight scene was amazing
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was pretty awesome. I cant even lie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a great movie! Don't listen to the critics, It's their job to be negative."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A deliciously suspenseful but exciting ride. Peyton and the team really stepped up their game on this one. Jonathan majors knocked it out of the park by making Kang equally terrifying and intriguing. So much world building and possibilities going forward. Please do yourself a favor and see this on the big screen! Also Paul Rudd is in it so why would you not? Marvel Studios is continuing to push the envelope and I‚Äôm happy to be along for the ride.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Los primero 40 minutos son aburridos pero esenciales para entender la historia, despu√©s lo √∫nico que hace es mejorar. Los m√°s destacados son Jhonatan Mayors y Katerin Newton quien se profundizan en sus personajes, exelente batalla final y las escenas post cr√©ditos  est√°n para gritar."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a lot of fun. Great visuals, lots of humor and heart."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the storyline. Needed more Kang
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great acting from Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd. Not so great from Cassy or Janet. Overall, the CGI was great but there were a few scenes that were rough. Surprisingly I genuinely laughed a few times... and it was from jokes that weren't typical for the MCU. A big complaint I have is Janets reason for not telling her family ANYTHING about the quantum realm. So frustrating to watch. Then for her to give the stupidest reason possible as to why was a nice cherry on top that we all saw coming. If she knew how powerful or dangerous Kang was then, like any reasonable person, she should have told her family why it is so dangerous. Or even better warned them before they got into the whole situation thus preventing it. Oh, but then we would have no movie you say? How about marvel hires someone over the age of 12 to write up an actual solid plot. While I have plenty of complaints (typical MCU complaints) ... for recent marvel movies, Quantumania is actually a step up."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,lots of explosions and falling. other then that really boring.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just another super hero miss.  That is time in my life I'm never getting back.
Ant-Man is dead to me."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was good but not great. Still entertaining and fun Kang alone is worth the watch. Critics don't matter anymore! In reading their reviews they look at these movies with a lens not for the genre or a fan. Does it have its issues? Yes. But definitely deserves a higher rating.  Check it out for yourselves this will be my last movie paying attention to rotten tomatoes. It doesn't matter so why should we care. Watch and criticize for yourself!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid MCU movie. Waiting for more KANG!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics, movie was fun and action packed! Good balance of humor and seriousness. Kang was amazing and stole the show. It's a solid mid tier MCU film, definitely doesn't deserve to be scored so low."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Their is more bad guys way more variants of the bad guys.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,They make these lead characters more and more cornball that I start rooting for the bad guys.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not funny. Very sci if. Didn't enjoy it.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Best Way To Begin The MCU's Phase 5, It's A Incredible Movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, definitely the way you introduce the next big villain. Bonus points for the end credit scenes."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good marvel movie. Best Ant Man yet. Modok was ridiculous and could have done without. Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors were excellent as well as Michelle Pfeiffer. Funny but not too forced. Critics are nuts, they rate Love and Thunder higher than this but this is WAY better of a movie than that."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rid√≠culo e pat√©tico, um filme extremamente gen√©rico com in√∫meros erros de roteiro e uma infantilidade de outro mundo, decepcionante."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A fairly entertaining movie, the visual effects are very good compared to past installments of the MCU, it made me feel like I was in a Star Wars movie again, however, I feel that it lacked some fluidity in the plot, otherwise quite good."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Everyone did what the need to do with writing  they was given writing was big problem or could be the editing. It could loss 30mins off the movie its too long. The end credits was the a major highlights.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A beautiful experience to the Quantum Realms. Kang was the highlights of the show. Great opening to phase 5
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,KANGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While some tighter writing would've allowed this movie to soar a lot higher, solid performances all around(especially from all-star Jonathan Majors) keep this film in the upper echelon of the MCU. Can't wait to see where Kang goes next."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Great story line and tied in well to the larger MCU! Very original!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is a film that marvel made because they wanted to and they did. And it lasts for at least a certain amount of time. It is widely appreciated by the right people and rumor has it it might save lives. You definitely want to watch this with your eyes. If you don't, you will likely not be saved. Unless you have Jesus"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a phenomenal movie! I love how they created the Quantum Realm, the acting was great! If your a fan of the MCU & Genuinely follow it then you'd love this movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Thin plot, but Johnathan Majors really stole the show as Kang!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,4 and a half stars only because the sound range was terrible. The movie itself was outstanding.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was pretty good to me honestly.... Way better than Thor: Love & Thunder
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,awesome movie better then thor
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything. Acting, Kang, how it set up MCU Phase 5, the creativity, the heartfelt moments, how it looked in IMAX 3D. This felt more Star Wars-y than the most recent Star Wars trilogy. Perfect 10/10 film."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Literally
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very good action and the humor although it doesn‚Äôt always land it‚Äôs still funny. And you can‚Äôt talk about this movie without bringing up Kaang he was Amazing!! And definitely a threat to watch out for. It does get a little slow at times but at the end of it I was entertained! Worth a watch
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A perfectly cromulent mid tier MCU movie. Don't expect a Criterion-level film like the critics inexplicably did and you'll have fun.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you like the weird and hate what critiques ""think"" are good and bad movies, this movie is for you. This isn't Winter Soldier but this is the best Ant-Man film. It is WAY better than Thor Love and Thunder and probably my 3rd favorite movie in phase 4/5 now behind Spider-Man No Way Home and Shang-Chi. Make up your own mind and I'm really not trusting critiques anymore. Did we see the same movie? CGI was great and MODOK is supposed to look weird like in the comics. It is the first movie to directly cross with a tv show being Loki and stay for both credit scenes. Loki is in this movie! Or is he? ;) 8.7/10! Winter Soldier and No Way Home are 10/10 to give you an idea of my grading. Watching Loki s1 does help!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Already seen it twice! Seeing a whole new world was great! Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors stole the show! Evangeline Lilly and Katy O Brian were stunning. Paul Rudd was great as usual. I can't wait to see where we go from here. Kang is no joke!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The best after the end game
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang was the saving grace of the movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great Marvel movie to start of the  year 2023. Antman and Wasp 3 is a family treat movie,  has this antman sense of humor which is very unique to most of the marvel movie franchise  and we all love it overall."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It wasn't great, but not bad at all. It's a decent into to phase 5. Don't listen to these critics, go watch the movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved this movie. The critics are idiots, marvel is still amazing."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing! Don‚Äôt know what all the hate is about!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie from opening credits until the end of the 2nd post scene!!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Fun story, good humour, great action."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Jonathan Majors didn't exceptional job! I like the twist and turns and comedy sprinkled throughout.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Frenetic & disjointed. Also kinda boring at times.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I'll admit after seeing the reviews I was skeptical but I honestly don't know if I watched the same movie that's getting panned. It was a solid Marvel outing with good humor and a great villain introduction. Maybe there were a couple of part that could have been cut for time but overall it great. I liked it better than Multiverse of Madness and Love and Thunder.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very boring and long.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Greatest Marvel Experience of 2023 thus far!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, introduced a lot of new characters while maintaining the ant man humour from the first two movies. Cassie and Janet both got a lot more to do than previous movies, and the quantum realm itself provided a fun atmosphere with weird characters giving it a fun tone that was contrasted by Kangs villainous presence throughout the film."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was okay kang was pretty awesome tho
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, lots of fun and amazing setup for the future of the MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily the best Ant Man movie that really honors the movies that came before, and enhancing the best parts of those movies to next level! This is a must see MCU movie that establishes the next few phases of the MCU! The visuals and world building are excellent! This is a fun story with great characters all around both old and new! I have watched the movie twice and liked it even more the second time!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,The very definition of a middling narrative.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,its a time pass weekend movie just to hang out nothing else....The plot of the movie felt like they just want to make series of Ant Man movies but nothing interesting to be honest.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Special effects were spectactular, lots of very good characters well portrayed by the actors and a most interesting story line.  A great science fiction movie and battle of good versus evil.  I'd go see it again."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is awesome. Y'all haters should shut your mouths and let people enjoy this movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It is boring. L. i think marvel is dying.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is perfect for an Ant Man movie, the best of it is clearly Kang The Conqueror, just amazing and very promising for the future of the MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great graphics, dialogue and fighting but I felt like I was watching AntMan in the LOTR : Two Towers."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Experience was enjoyable.. love the cast..
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,EVERYTHING about this movie is just the greatest. Even Jonathan Majors himself made an epic Kang!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really great step in the MCU and a great way to kick off phase 5! Most of the jokes hit where they should, and there was some fun psychedelic scenes that were reminiscent of the first Dr Strange. Action was good, having rewatched the first 2 ant man recently it was a huge step up. Majors COMMANDS the scenes he was in and the supporting cast was great!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Marvel is back!! The Marvel we all loved is back.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good idea and concept, executed decent but I felt like it should have been longer. Beginning was fast and ending was longer, wasn't stable timewise. Other than that, good cgi, amazing villain, and wait for the pre and post-credit scenes!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good introduction to Kang, but beyond that it felt more like Star Wars than Marvel. Expect Sci Fi, not SuperHero"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great world building, characters, action, and humor! This was excellent!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great flick went with my kids
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great, I expected it to be funny and entertaining. and it was !"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a Marvel fan that is up to date on all series/movies, I loved it.  It would probably be confusing for someone that is not, but it's still a fun movie for anyone."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not the best, but it‚Äôs not The Eternals. If your a huge fan of the MCU watch it. If not a super fan you can skip, and not miss out on anything significant from phase 5."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie! Don't listen to the critics
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really like the movie, the way they made the quantum realm. Great casting, love the antman family, and Jonathan Major was just awesome. Kang is really is the best part of the movie, was a bit disapointing bye the way they defeat him at the end, but can't wait to see more of Kang"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Seems like way more time was spent on visuals rather than on the plot. Overalls felt like bits and pieces (visually and plot) were copy and pasted from other media.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a wonderful movie that I enjoyed it very much
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great super hero family movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The action was pretty good made me like Ant man more  as a hero the plot was pretty good especially for what it is building up I enjoyed it overall it was pretty good
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved antman!!!!
Can't wait to see the kang dynasty saga"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,great world building of the quantum realm. also did a good job building a back story for Kang funny moments and shocking results. best marvel movie since end game
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One more horrible super hero movie. 
This movie is a real punishment."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I wish i was on acid watching this üòÇ
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best of the Antman trilogy and the best marvel movie since 'No Way Home'.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lives up to expectations and then some. Builds the wild universe of the quantum realm. While introducing the next great villain, Jonathan Abrams makes the movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really had a good time at the theater on Thursday night when I took my daughter to see QUANTUMANIA. The character development of Kang was great, and it was refreshing to see Ant-Man have to leverage his abilities, resources, and family to stand up to an enemy way out of his league. It was nice to see a movie where the character choices for the most part made sense, the plot holes (yes, of course, there are some) weren't a big deal, and you could escape into the Marvel Universe."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved it. Great story and just the right amount of humor in the perfect spots. Was totally enthralled the whole time. Definitely a must see!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was probably one of the best movies leading up to Loki and the mcu
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buena pel√≠cula los cr√≠ticos son puros zurdos que no tiene idea
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It had its slow points and a few far fetched parts but all in all a good bridge movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie, really don't get all the fuss. Some things are for the best and they did many things I enjoyed"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly it was so, so good. I went into this movie not expecting much because the critic reviews were so bad, and I left it questioning their credentials. A consistent story throughout the film, a terrifying villain, intense moments, humour that landed‚Ä¶a wildly, fun rollercoaster of emotions. One of the best movies of the Multiverse saga. Do not trust the critics."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a must see. The Best Ant-Man yet! Marvel is back with a vengeance in phase 5!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful movie I mean there are no words, I do not normally agree with the critics on reviews but I have to on this one, worst 2hrs in recent cinematic history Marvel I want 2 hours of my life back you theifs, I feel robbed. I should have sorted my sock drawer. I really do question the 5 star reviews on here, are they paid are they real people?"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the movie. Great acting. Kang was fantastic. Lots of funny moments.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best marvel movie in a while.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,LOVED it! watching it again tonight :)
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome. I would call it the Thor Ragnarok of the Antman series. Majors was unbelievable as Kang and definitely the first worthy villain successor to Thanos. Truly enjoyed it and definitely think the critics are crazy worth their reviews. Hank Pyman was awesome and shined as the true antman in the 3rd act. I even think the length was perfect and didn't overplay its hand. And the end credits OMG I can't wait for what's coming in the multiverse war. Definitely a top ten in the Marvel universe.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw the first Ant-Man movie, the second and this third one that just came out too and I really liked them ü§óü§óü§ó"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"a bad and boring first act, really long second act, an excited and engaging 3rd act, but the way kang is defeated is just so bland for an otherwise compelling villain."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed film, great family dynamics and awesome main villain!!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,AntMan and Kang both shine in this movie but Johnathan Majors definitely commands the screen when he's there. The reported reshoots last year seemed apparent during the final fight. I think it's much better than some recent MCU movies
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania. I love the first two movies but this is definitely the best of the trilogy. I don‚Äôt know what some of these critics are talking about. Firstly, the characters are all great. Scott and Cassie and their relationship is a nice progression from the first two movies and is very heartwarming. Hope is very good, Hank is as funny and witty as ever and Janet really shines in this movie. I loved what they did with MODOK, i thought he was hilarious. The standout is definitely Kang with Jonathan Majors giving one of the best villains the MCU has seen in years. He was so badass. I loved how sci-fi, wacky and weird this movie was. The movie had some great comedy but I liked that it was bit more serious than the previous movie. The third act was insane and a blast, one of the best in the comic book genre in a while. And the post credit scenes are both very exciting. Phase 5 is off to a great start and I‚Äôm super excited to see the multiverse saga continue to unfold. All in all, I loved the movie and had a great time watching it. It was the perfect balance of an Ant-Man story while also teasing and setting up the larger story that is to come."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Decent start to phase 5. Much better than Eternals and black panther. It still has some shades of phase 4 M-she-u with ant man pushed to the back seat his daughter and Janet doing most of the driving of the movie. MODOK MUST LIVE!! Whoever is rating this the same as Eternals is on crack.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was amazing and it was just a great movie in general. Best Marvel movie since no way home
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania delivers what fans have been after, a story that actually matters to the greater MCU.

That said this is not the 3rd movie in the Antman Trilogy as much as it is the first instalment of Antman since Endgame.
The movie turns its back on many of the things that made the first two so loved. The humour isn't punchy, there's a couple jokes but largely this is a drama. There's no heist here, and the misfit side characters in the movie are a lot less fleshed out and endearing.

Scenes with MODOK should have probably been excluded entirely as they added virtually nothing to the film.

Ultimately I would have preferred to see this story told across a limited series on Disney+ where the many boondoggles of the quantum realm could be bettered used and give new characters enough screen time to feel like they mattered at all."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was so good! Rotten tomatoes can go F*** themselves the piece of shits! 
They give willow series a high rating? F***n rubbish! Don't listen to rotten tomatoes reviews"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"good cast, good CG, the best Antman series by far."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very enjoyable. As good if not slightly better than the last 2 Ant Man movies. I do not go to see a second-tier superhero like Ant Man expecting a first tier (Iron Man, Spider Man) experience in the first place, so my expectations were met if not exceeded. The story did drag a bit especially towards the beginning but not horrible by any means. My only WTF moment was the MORDOK Character. I know he is comic book accurate but that doesn't stop him from looking ridiculous and a character I could have done without. Overall, a solid marvel movie and if this is any indication of what's to come, I think the next Marvel phase may just rekindle some of its 1st and 2nd phase magic."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"MCU is a mess and has lost its focus on the main element that made their films successful, fun. Not even Paul Rudd's charm could save this film. I think it is time we put the MCU in the same place as their comic books, the recylce bin."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst marvel movie yet.   It felt like a bad 1980s tv show.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved this movie.

A fantastic entry into the MCU, and a brilliant opener to phase 5! MODOK was fantastic, I loved seeing more fallouts of the Blip, and the post credit scenes have me hyped for Loki, and whatever comes next! Only issue I had was with pacing after the first act, but besides that, a really great film!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action packed, funny film. Plot is decent, expected from a marvel film. Kang is an amazing villian and Majors's performance delivers. The characters are great, and overall it's a fun movie. Amazing post credit scenes and set-ups."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dumb, dumb and dumb!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"So much fun, felt like some of the older/better MCU movies again! Had a great balance of action, comedy that felt right for the characters, and a bit of drama (even a good message for kids haha)"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"RT should just get rid of the critics section. They're a bunch of pretentious non contributing zeroes whose opinion doesn't matter and has no bearing on what real people like.

This is easily the best of the Ant-Man movies and a great start to Phase 5 for Marvel."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,A bit too juvenile for me .
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite being a generic hero movie, it ends up being fun and promising. The creation of a quantum universe is so well introduced that you soon get used to and accept all its concepts. Jonathan Majors stands out absurdly delivering everything in his role, while Paul Rudd's charisma continues captivating."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Every Marvel Fan should see this movie one. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is another great movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Little too goofy when trying to be funny.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is a must-see it's like Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness but better
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So a lot of this movie worked for me. Jonathan Majors is fantastic. The CGI is a step up from the last several MCU entries. And, of course, Paul Rudd is an affable lead, as always. The more serious scenes were my favorite parts. Unfortunately there were some ill-timed, really forced comedy scenes that undercut some of the best moments of the film. This has been a problem the MCU has had for awhile, but it‚Äôs becoming more and more pronounced. It seems afraid to let authentic, genuinely emotional moments land without forcing in a joke. Wakanda Forever worked a lot better for me because it let the dramatic moments land without feeling the need to put in an over the top comedic moment. The comedy in the other two Ant-Man films were frankly less forced and more natural, and that style of humor works a lot better, in my opinion. And there are multiple scenes that actually were funny in this one! Overall, this movie is still worth a watch. I might‚Äôve given it 5 stars if not for the unfunny attempts to get laughs - including turning one legendary Marvel villain into nothing but a joke."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. Kang definetly steals the show.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"We enjoyed the story line, the villain, and the special effects."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great start to 2023 for marvel movies.
Jonathan Majors gives a great performance as Kang."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"it is a well developed entertainment. The story makes sense and the ties to previous related movies (Ant Man) is well put together. Good writing. 
The actions are very well put together. 
The inclusion of the ""fighting daughter"" makes sense. 
In general good movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was so good! Loved every minute of it!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun, entertaining ride. There's some comedy, action, and a quality villain. It's definitely worth a watch."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang is coming 2.0. (*see Loki) Big multiverse building world with an overall disjointed storyline. Early segments could have been left on the cutting room floor to make room for an earlier intro into Kang.  The cast do their best to hold it all together. Majors rules the day as Kang.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'd like to give a breakdown for those who aren't invested in the greater MCU/fans of the comics, and one for those who are. 

For those who aren't- I'd give this a flat 5/10. If you plan on seeing this movie without any prior knowledge in the marvel universe, it will be a complex mess. You'll lack context and motives, so I wouldn't bother in all honesty. If you plan on seeing it and have seen Ant Man 1/2, this will be a good entertaining watch, but will lack in character development. There's a lot that leaves desired for this to be the end of a trilogy, but it isn't really made to be that, moreso a stepping stone into introducing Kang the Conqueror. 

For those who are interested in the greater storyline/have context- This movie is a 7/10. It does its goals of setting up Kang, who was portrayed very faithfully to the comics. The story had a bit of a rushed beginning, and this is where I'm marking it down. It opens with multiple character subplots which don't really grow in any meaningful way. Many times I was left wanting more for storylines mentioned throughout, but they couldn't close out on most of them. I don't say this too often for marvel movies, but it would've benefited with an extra half hour or so. Knowing how close the movie was to being perfect for its goals was a thought that prevented this score from being put any higher. 

Acting 8/10- Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors definitely stood out for character portrayal. Rudd was the optimistic Ant Man, who had actually well timed jokes (unlike Marvel's most recent other project). Majors perfectly pulled off Kang the Conqueror. As a manipulative mastermind, Kang is a fearsome villain who when is shown to lose his temper, can show the unraveling mind of a narcissist who has lost control. Majors depicts this in a very convincing manner. Evangeline Lilly does great as the wasp, she's mostly a supporting role but when given the spotlight sells the emotion well. Michael Douglas does great as Hank Pym once again, most of my feelings with Lilly are shared with Douglas. My one very large disappointment is with Michelle Pfeiffer playing as Janet. Her character felt very one-dimensional and lines had nearly no delivery. She had a couple great scenes towards the end, but overall her acting compromised some moments. 

VFX 8/10- Honestly surprised with how good the VFX look after the previous marvel projects. Quantum realm looked really nice except for some scenes which felt very ""green-screeny"", energy based effects looked good, quantum civilians looked really well animated, and a lot of other locals looked nice. There was a character who could've used some work though. 

As a summary, Ant Man and the Wasp Quantamania was a great movie to push the MCU forward, but lacked as a standalone film. With some incomplete storylines and spotty acting, it deserves the ranking of 3 and 1/2 stars."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is a fun time and setting up the Kang saga well.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel is going in the wrong direct. The movie was just a huge cgi mess.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was bad. The pacing was really bad. The worst part is the fake reviews saying it was good. I think Paul was amazing as always but everybody is just saying that Kang was great, he was, but that does not make a bad movie good. I think marvel will make better films but this is not it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"So wild diverse and cool, maybe one too many jokes, but overall another great marvel movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie had alot of action, great for the franchise"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"SPOILER FREE: Visuals were PEAK, comparable to Guardians. Performances by Rudd, Newton and Majors were perfection. 2 hour movie could've and should've been longer. Kang definitely is scary powerful and can't wait to see him in future projects!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,awesome..welcome to phase 5
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don‚Äôt listen to the haters. This movie is good, and in many ways is a return to the mind of mainstream Marvel storytelling we enjoyed in Phases 1 & 2 as they built towards the epic level of phase 3. Critics are making the same mistake a lot of ‚Äúcasual‚Äù Marvel fans are making with Phase 4 and now into Phase 5‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre letting the expectations they. Ring into the theater with them impede their enjoyment of what is being presented. Just let the storytellers tell the story, don‚Äôt let your idea of what you want or expect the story to be prejudice your ability to view the film objectively. Keep hearing people say, ‚ÄúI would rather they have done X instead of Y‚Äù. Fine, but who cares about what you wanted other than you? What did you think about the choices that were actually made? This film was fun, it had some good humor, plenty of exposition and action, nothing too earth shattering. Not every show or movie is going to be the scale of End Game or original as Wanda Vision, and that is okay. But it is entertaining and is building to something bigger. Because the scale of something like Infinity War and End Game has to be earned, and this is part of that story telling process. You aren‚Äôt going to learn anything new about these heroes, because in many ways, this movie isn‚Äôt focused on them. No, this film is an Origin story of a sort. This movie belongs entirely to Kang, and I am here for it!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was great and good balance of humor and seriousness. Overall pretty good movie and a good set up for the future! Don't listen to critics though just go in and enjoy marvel!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome! It was truly outstanding from the beginning to the end. It makes you think for the worst then the for the better then for the worst if you watched it. So merging for the whole family.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ya know I gotta say, I came into this film thinking it wasn‚Äôt gonna be good because of what I heard online but boy was I wrong. But first imma get the cons out of the way because they‚Äôre aren‚Äôt a lot. MODOK was severely wasted, head cgi was so ass, shit looked like George Lopez straight outta Sharkboy & Lavagirl. Wasp had no use here as always. This film broke the marvel of the main protagonist losing something in the third installment, it bothered me that he didn‚Äôt lose anything but not that much. I have mixed feelings about right as he exited the quantum realm, it went back to exactly the same as the opening scene when he was walking down the street with his monologue.‚Ä®Now for the good stuff: 1st idk what it is with making theirs girl look good but üëå. Cassie (Kathryn Newton) was kinda cute. Also some may disagree but I think Jonathan Majors did a really well job as Kang and for this being the conquerors first real appearances in the MCU, I think it was done j right, not too much yet not too little. Some people were the big bad Kang that we‚Äôre gonna see in Kang Dynasty. I wanna see that, because this isn‚Äôt the Kang Dynasty yet, I wanna see his power build up over time, and I think this was a rlly good start. Considering the first time we saw Thanos was was him sitting in a chair talking üòë Moving on from Kang, because he was needed for a few scenes in act 1, I thinks Bill Murray‚Äôs role was good enough. And this time we see more of a father side come out of Scott with him trying to get back to Cassie. Some people might argue that he didn‚Äôt develop because he was all about defeating Kang, leaving the realm and getting his daughter back. All I have to say is, if u were in his shoes, you would too.¬†‚Ä®And also u can rlly only go so far with development because it gets to a point where once u get developed, you should embrace it and kinda go from there. The quantum realm cgi itself was cool and the new suits were rlly nice, kinda gave me that Power Ranger vibe, which I‚Äôm not complaining. I think Cassie didn‚Äôt have much development but it was nice development, from this out of jail, back in girl, to a real hero just like her father. Also since when was Pok√©mon in the MCU lol. Before I saw this, I thought it was too soon for Secret Wars but now I‚Äôve seen Kang, I think Secret Wars is perfect. Overall, I think this film gets too much hate, I think it was pretty good and I‚Äôm excited for what the future has in store. Great way to start phase 5!!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an incredibly fun! Michelle Pfeiffer is a stand out Ant Queen. I love it and I can't wait to see it again!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was an edge of your seat thrill ride through the Quantum Realm! Jonathan Majors delivered in every sequence. Kang is a force to be reckon with! This film solidifies My favorite Ant Man throughout the entire trilogy. Paul Rudd has moments where he was classic Paul Rudd.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought that it was a great visual stunning movie in every way.  I thought the jokes hit perfect every time.  The story was told great and as much as the critics claimed that all Scott Lang was worried about the whole movie was his daughter Cassie.  DUH!!! He is a father, as a father of Three daughters I would be just as worried as he was about getting my daughter back from and evil man like Kang!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think rotten tomato critics are biased against the new Marvel series. 48%?? You are over reacting

I enjoyed the movie so much. It has enough humor that time passed by so quickly. Although it looked like star wars in the beginning, the humor, Cast and overall story didn't disappoint."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Ants solo kang. Also Darren is him
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"True believers, what can I say?  Marvel is back in a BIG way.  Go see this movie!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"They pulled off a very confusing exposition about time dilation and multiversal travelling in an Ant-Man movie. What else you need? Ant-Man really dying? Not here, not yet. Don't expect so much, the actions was fun and the stake is still high. The ending really does leave the entire MCU hanging with immense amount of possibilities, which I'm sure we can be excited for. Also Darren, wasn't that bad, it's not good, but definitely don't deserve the amount of hate that it got. Wasp Van Dyne last save was a great reminder that she is still part of the show. Hank Pym's have never been cooler. 

B
Ant- Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed it very much, don't listen to the critics - this is way better than the Eternals and many of the phase 4 movies.  Jonathan Majors was amazing as Kang, movie was full of great action and effects.  I already want to see it again."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not great Marvel movie..pretty boring
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm so glad we have moved past the phases of trauma and we can finally have a fun marvel movie again.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Idk what the critics are complaining about. This is a great movie. Fun and entertaining. Go see it
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid start to phase 5, really felt fresh to watch a movie that felt like genuine effort and passion went behind in making it. Mostly oustanding cgi, a lot of worldbuildi. Didn't quite feel like it closed out the ant man trilogy, felt more like a beginning to soemthing new, which is more exciting. Paul Rudd as ever was charming, although his character was mostly limited to ""where's Cassie, is she okay"". Jonathan majors is oustanding as Kang, can't wait to see what he does with other variants in the future. Michelle Pfeiffer also puts in a notable lead performance, which cant go unnoticed. Overall 9/10 + plus two of the possibly best post credit scenes ever to grace the MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great animation but boring.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it and looking forward to more kang in the future. I don't really understand the complaint about the dialogue I loved it
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Love that it explored the father/daughter relationship of Casey and Scott. Even my 10 yr old hugged me during those moments. The story was good and graphics were great.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great graphics. Very well made. Just a fun date night movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"SPOILER ALERT!!


Though the cgi is good but the plot is weak. They made Modok here like a little b*tch. He's been trapped there by ant man for a long time then the last minute he changed his mind to help them. I've still have some picks here and there but the most unbelievable thing here, is that the strongest Kang got defeated in this movie. There's no point of showing the future Kangs when the strongest got easily defeated. The Kang in this movie is Kang the Conquerer, he literally conquered many worlds. But got defeated by some ants..."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just wanted a little more from the story, if this movie comes back to have more meaning in a few years then Id re-examine my rating. I was entertained but could have skipped it in theaters looking back. "
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was quite a good movie after no way home, the story is good i actually wanted Kang to win the fight it was quite the good movie, good job marvel! But that's just my taste u gotta see it for yourself."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The pro critics are idiots.  This is a fun movie, and KANG is badder than Thanos.
Give. Me. More. KANG."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than I expected after seeing reviews
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was disappointing. Don't expect it to be the ""biggest movie of the year"" (which is what the director called it. They have my money, I'm dissatisfied. Thumbs down marvel you could've done better. Merci."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I wasn't that big of a fan of the first two but this one was amazing! It was funny in all the right places and the action was great.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Let's start with the script. Amateur. Characters? No chemistry especially since this was about a family on an ""adventure"". The story is confusing and I'm some cases, (Michelle Phiffer), just lame and I usually love her acting chops. 

With movie prices going ever higher, save your money."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Me gustaron los efectos especiales y la trama.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great. I brought my husband to see it for his birthday.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I really like it  it awesome why is everyone dislikes it?
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was like avatar/ready player one/the cantina scene from star wars/guardians of the Galaxy all existed in a dark CGI world with no sunlight. it had some funny parts and I enjoyed the actors but it was too Goofy for me and I took my kids so I could have done without the 50 cuss words
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Can't believe the critics expect to get taken seriously rating this movie below movies like Dark World and Iron Man 3. Absolutely unserious joke. The movie wasn't perfect, but it was right in the marvel average wheelhouse. It's good and fun and deserves better than a ridiculous 40 something percent rating."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Simple story, and for kids boddoks."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania was awesome! Sure, not perfect and a bit short, but a really fun adventure with amazing effects and plenty of great jokes. Some might be sad that this is very different to the previous small adventure comedies of Antman 1 and 2, but it still works! I'm not sure why the critics are so down on this flick."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good a lot of action and just enough of humour just perfect 

2 post credit scene really good"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie and great use of Michelle Pfeifer!!
Let the Dynasty reign"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked the film. I thought MODOK was goofy though, but it's practically impossible to make an awesome MODOK in live action, the CGI face just was off to me. I'm not sure about Cassie, she started just annoying but got better as the film went on. I didn't like that the film basically happens because Janet keeps all these things a secret... then tries to hide things again. That ""let's hide things from everyone then bad things happen"" thing just annoys me. On the good side, the environment and weird creatures was awesome. Kang is insanely good. The barbarian woman (can't remember her name) is a badass. I'd definitely say watch it if you like the MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's just not that great.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good start to the next phase in the MCU. M.O.D.O.K. was a little bit of a let down and the Ants play no games!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Hilarious and magically serious
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny when needed to be funny very funny to watch
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Introduces Kang‚Äôs many variants into the marvel universe in a ok way
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought this was great. Not perfect. Very abstract at times, but I really enjoyed it."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"After reading reviews this week, I walked in prepared to possibly see the worst MCU film to date. I was pleasantly surprised to find I liked it, to me it's a lower middle of the road MCU film. Jonathan Majors is the absolute highlight of the movie. Once he shows up I feel like the film really gets going. Excited to see the the rest of his career in general, but especially as Kang."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A MUST WATCH!!! SUCH A VERY FUNNY FILMüî•üíØ
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A solid watch. Jonathan Majors stole the show.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was imaginative and creative, with a great script, and pulled off in stunning fashion by the actors involved.  Kang was as brutal and ruthless as I had imagined.  The film was the perfect blend of silly-absurdity with terrifying tension.  The critics are wrong, this was a wonderful film that expands the universe of the MCU.  Don't miss it!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film starts slow for me but after first 30 mins when kang shows up the film  gets really good for me :) Jonathan Major star power is on full display in this film, a very fun film"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible CGI effects and very bad storyline. Lines were just not well written
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely excellent.  So much fun!  Jonathan Majors is outstanding.  Wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of Bill Murray‚Äôs character but that would be my only complaint.  I‚Äôll be watching this one on repeat.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Another reason to love Scott. Paul Rudd makes me smile every time I see him come on screen. Jonathan Majors is a force to be reckoned with. Good chemistry between all cast & crew. The father/daughter storyline is great.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The story of the quantum realm and how there‚Äôs many universes
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the few times I agree with the critics.  There are a lot of plot holes and you really have to turn your brain off and they rely on the audience to fill in the blanks on a few things. Also so tired of the deus ex machina saves. Not only was it used once but it was used 3 times.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Is a nice family adventure that setup a mutiple threat for the multiverse
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed the visuals. I did not feel the movie had much of a plot. It was actually nice to sit back and just enjoy the visuals without having to keep my mind engaged in figuring out or working on figuring out the plot.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I give it a 4 out of 5 stars. I enjoyed the movie very much and the end credits scenes are probably the most ominous yet.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Marvel movie since Spider-Man No way Home... Very nice change of pace. Don't let the critics fool you.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed Quantumania a lot! It started off bit slow but by the second act it found it's footing and when Kang shows up, it didn't slow down. I had more fun watching this than Love and Thunder and Wakanda Forever. Don't listen to the critics. There is a serious disconnct this time with them and the audience. Johnathan Majors is awesome as Kang. I can see where they're going with it. Start reading Hickman's Avengers/Secret Wars run. This Ant-Man gets a B+."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,No esperaba nada y aun asi logro decepcionarme
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Man I love it! Marvel can't miss with these movies!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I LOVED THIS MOVIE! Def a must see. The beginning starts off kind of slow but its full of alot of drama thriller and action. They did their thing with this movie. Don‚Äôt want to give too much to not spoil
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable movie. There wasn't too much cheesey jokes and the story was relatively compulsive. Jonathan Majors was great. My only issues were that the first act was sloppy and the cgi was messy at times (obviously). Overall, I would give it a 7&1/2 and would recommend it to watch."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Lots of great CGI, good story, but a little confused. Kang will be back, though, so there'll be a sequel, again."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Marvel film since Endgame (if you don‚Äôt count Loki)
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"N√£o d√° pra dizer que o problema √© apenas o CGI como n√≥s outros filmes atuais da Marvel. O problema aqui √© atua√ß√£o, roteiro, fotografia... √© um filme que n√£o leva a nada a n√£o ser vermos que existe algu√©m chamado Kang. Um filme descart√°vel e sem base alguma."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best movie out of the Ant-Man trilogy by far! It stos pretending to be Science fiction and completly runs with the fantasy genre, making it much more enjoyable for some nerds like my self xD. I loved that while being funny, it still has some very important themes such as identity, colonization and fatherhood.
I highly recomend it!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked the movie it was a lot of CGI, it was weird at times but I enjoyed it mostly."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I was disappointed at first that we're thrusted straight into the quantum realm. It felt rushed, but I must say that as the film went on I was left with a smile on my face. The difference of Kang (Jonathan Majors) in this compared to his unhinged cooky variant in Loki, made for a chilling encounter. 
7/10, it's Marvel."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Another good marvel picture working in an old villain in a new guise that took a few minutes to adjust to. Once there they then made him a bit too goofy for me but I realize after this movie what else would they do with him? The visual effects were stunning and the action was great. If I had any complaint it was the use of exposition. Multiple times characters had to fill us in on things that happened off screen or earlier. Kang was everything I hoped and glad to see them preparing the next generation of avengers roster..
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,didn't add to the Marvel universe in a decent way.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it a lot actually. I was not going to go because of the reviews but glad I didn't trust them. I liked it better than the first and second ant man movies. It has to be my favorite out of the ant man movies.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining and introducing the new main villain of the franchise, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania provides new locations and beings within the Quantum Realm. While new characters are presented in a memorable way, existing ones don't necessarily get a moment to shine; not enough time to cover both. The plot should have developed more of certain topics, such as an unlikely friendship between two lost characters, but focuses on a few known concepts and exploits them to the point of making the main characters seem one-dimensional. A promising start for Phase 5, this Ant-Man installment still delivers the fun for which we have loved this character previously and fulfill expectations with its post-credit scenes."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was so hopeful for the start of Phase 5. I should have known better. It feels like all the talent has abandoned Marvel Studios. Story is rough. Lots of convenient and coincidental plot points. Kang isn't developed enough as a true threat (he's defeated by ants). CGI is rough. Lots of wtf moments that don't make sense. Characters power levels are all over the place. Difficult to care about the main characters. Lots of bad jokes that feel out of place. Unless you have young kids, save some money and stay home to watch when it comes out on Disney+."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action.   Some parts too loud with the sound.  funky movie line.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie falls short of what was teased in the trailers vs. What played out on screen. It was too ""happy"". This movie shouldn't of had a good ending, and in all honesty, should have had a tragic ending like infinity war, where key characters were killed for shock value. Then you could argue that they could come back, but a different variant.

The pacing was slow, drawn out, and you don't meet Kang till near the end of the film. He is severely undermined in power, and got to the point where rolling eyes was entertaining. The film was predictable. The good guys win yet again! You needed the set the tone that this villain is far worse than thanos, and you made him a joke"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I'll be honest. I LOVED this movie!  Ive loved all of the Ant-Man franchises when I didn't think a lot of people did.  I don't understand the negative critiques. I thought this movie executed everything well.  Janet Pym was introducing EVERYONE to the quantum realm. This was very much about what happens in families when families keep secrets. And it tied all the last three movies up nicely with a funny cliff hanger! this is my favorite MCU movie now and ANT-MAN is my favorite MCU franchise!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed the movie. The post credit scenes were great.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film was terrible, the plot was terrible, the acting was terrible and cringy and it was comical in the ways it should not have been. One of the worst films I have ever gone to watch in cinema."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Short Review: It's kind of mid.

Long Review: 

Ant-Man Specific Complaints
1) There were cliche family interactions and generic written lines of dialogue for the Ant-Man family, especially from Cassie. I admired her beauty and loved her enthusiasm as an actress, but the lazy writing didn't do her justice. She felt like a superficial character to me.  
2) I hated how they kept playing around and not ""revealing"" Kang, as if his name was taboo (Harry Potter vibes). We saw him in the trailer. There was no suspense or mystery to build. 
3) We didn't learn much about the Quantum Realm other than the fact that it was probably inspired by Star Wars (guess who Darth Vader is). This is somewhat acceptable though, since we're still exploring the concept.

Common Marvel complaints
1) There were some jokes and ""emotional"" moments that felt forced and seemed unnecessary.
2) This movie felt rushed, just like Phase 4. The writing and CGI specifically.
3) I've ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS had a problem with the tasteless and forgettable music Marvel puts in their movies. The only time I thoroughly enjoyed the music for Ant-Man 3 was when the end credits hit. 

Compliments:
Kang, and surprisingly Modok, were the most interesting characters of this movie. Jonathan Majors' portrayal of Kang was captivating. He showed how brilliant, complex, and manipulative Kang can be. It was majestic. Modok had some funny interactions and jokes that genuinely made me laugh. I wish Hope had more lines and scenes, she was vital to this movie, I enjoyed her being there.

It could be because I came with high expectations or it could even be Marvel fatigue, but, I know for a fact this movie is not as great as it could have been."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Marvel movie since No Way Home
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok expected more.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it all - Marvel continues to shine in their storytelling.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. I felt like it had a good mix of classic ant man comedy with a good amount of serious moments. I feel like they wasted M.O.D.O.K's character but I still found his character turning moment to be hilarious and I'm glad he got his moment. Overall. I loved it. Good start to phase 5.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not a good movie at all, the first hour dragged and was very slow.  It almost felt like a DC movie. If you accidentally fall asleep but wake up with 30 minutes to go and catch the end credit scenes, you'll still be good."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very boring and stretched out storyline, hyper predictable and unnecessary vulgar language. Paul Rudd was good, but Michelle Pfeiffer was absolutely dreadful. My coworker fell asleep not even halfway through it, I think it's time Disney hired some more creators and writers because they're out of ideas (have been for a LONG time) and need to realize that filthy language and unnecessary sexual innuendos don't make a good movie. -100/10 absolutely would not see it again."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great I liked it a lot, kang commands respect. The best movie of the year."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,watch it twice already. anything that feel bland on it two previous film is weirdly elevated in the Quantumania. the world and role that build around the concept of quantum realm/world is so great and makes me want to know more about it. action 100x better than the second film. Certain character is wasted despite having one of the most interesting backstory.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed it but it wasn't one of my top/favourite marvel films. The negatives: The whole scenario of the movie and how they got there bothered me a bit because it seemed like the story was shoehorned into something that happened and now they're changing it to get another story out of it. Though I don't remember the first 2 films well enough to say for sure how much of a stretch they were making but from my memory it seems like they did have to make one. I can't really elaborate without spoilers. My other feeling about it was that it didn't really feel like a Marvel movie. A couple scenes I thought I was watching Star Wars, Wreck-It Ralph 2, and The Wall maybe (which isn't bad, it just feels recycled). It was quite the trip and I found myself thinking was this world and these characters created in the comic books (if it was direct from the comics) in the 70's when everyone was on stuff. Some of it was a little more disturbing than funny or wonderous. Maybe it was intended that way but it's not my cup of tea. Positives: I think it was a great acting job by the actor who plays the villain. Definitely brought something new to the table and made him very interesting. Love the action with Ant-Man changing sizes and using his abilities. The family aspects were heart warming. There were definitely some funny moments. Overall it was entertaining and I would watch it again. As well it's definitely a must see as an essential beginning to the next phase in the MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its a perfect first step. Movie drags on in some moments when trying to get a single word out of Janet about the situation, but that is more of a character issue rather than a production issue. Majors came on strong and did good in his role. Movie kept humor that we all loved in the first 2 Ant-mans, and MODOKs character was a perfect fit (there is no design of MODOKs character that wouldn't have looked silly). Critics can easily say a movie was bad, but most of them cannot go into detail of why something is bad and how it could be improved. Another issue is watching these marvel movies from an outside perspective where you cant truly appreciate a movie if you don't understand its original story. If you know nothing of marvel comics, then you barely have any room to complain. Its like hating the titanic movie without knowing the titanic was a real story. All I can say for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, have an open mind, judge it for yourself, and understand that this isn't meant to be the biggest film for the current phase, this is the first step in preparing us for the future phases."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Once again the critics get it wrong, this was a really fun movie that my whole family loved and a great start to Phase 5.  And Majors as Kang killed it!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Balanced the drama and humour really well. Nice arcs. All round a fun movie and Johnathan Majors slayed (best part as you'd expect - although Paul Rudd and Catherine Newton were phenomenal too). Everything in this movie worked tbf, and I don't understand the critics' hate, this movie worked so well and Jeff Loveness really gave his best here. Great film, great start to phase 5."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Esperaba mucho y es otra comedia de marvel
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Kang is amazing. Just amazing.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I dont get all the fuss about how it was a mid movie. Sure in some of the talking scenes it got boring btw this is my fresh out of theater reaction. Im not going to lie Kang was an absolute menace along with any man and Cassie really delivered. I dont now about you. You have to watch this movie. The last fight scene was great along with 2 important end credit scenes just going to say 2 letters lo.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Very fun film that has opened up the start of phase 5 and the beginning of the new big bad.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant Man 3 is a really awesome movie. In the end (and the post credit scene) the movie weakens a little (but not much). Best disney product in mcu since loki.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very boring plot and sound was way too low.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best in the trilogy hands down!!!

Fun and entertaining till the end."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"What an amazing movie with great relatable characters every scene an eye feast and good old rotten tomatoes gives it 48%? 48%? Really I think your reviewers are blind deaf and dumb, very dumb"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing characters, great if a little iffy visuals, like a comic book come to life in all the best ways! Wacky, weird, fun and with all the heart of the previous Ant-Man films to boot"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,What a way to kick off Phase 5! The movie gave viewers a glimpse at what a beast Kang will be. Quantamania was visually stunning and had a strong storyline with two amazing post credit scenes that you want to stay for.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like to say this movie was by far the best way to kick of the MCU phase 5 from Jonathan Majors being one of the most best person to ever be casted as Kang the Conqueror was the best choice they ever made, and the chemistry between actors Kathryn Newton and Paul Rudd was Outsandting , and M.O.D.O.K was and absolutely amazing the CGI and Visual Effects was so awesome, so I recommend anyone and everyone to see this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,don't know what movie critics saw. I had a great time. favorite marvel movie since endgame
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a fantastic and fun ride, all performances were fantastic Kang was amazing! MODOK was funny and great to see. What a deadly film üçª"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Deeper dive into Kang and his role in the MCU moving forward. I'm glad MCU is taking time to develop this big bad!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"My 15 year old son and I just left the theater and we really enjoyed Ant-Man 3. Every character in the movie was great. Plenty of action and strangeness in the the Quantum Universe. Kang is a powerful villain and I cant wait to see more. There must be two different types of viewers in the world. Those that like the movie and those that don't. I completely disagree with every detractor of this movie. I did not see any of their complaints and I looked. I loved the movie 
and had a great time and look forward for the next time we see Kang and the entire Ant family. I can't trust these critic reviews. If you were interested in this movie, see it! Don't let someone's opinion stop you because they may watch a movie for different reasons than you do. I watch as a fan and critics watch just to be critical of someone's art. And then its obvious some people see movies just to make up problems to tear it down and hopefully stop others from wanting to see it. It almost happened to me but my son was adamant about going and I am so happy I listened. I only had one issue and that was not seeing luis and the other guys but Im ok with that. I can't wait to see it again."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,fantastic! it was funny without being cringe and just an enjoyable movie all around! great introduction for Kangs character cant wait to see what is next!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a long time comic book fan, this wild adventure exceeded my expectations! While I do feel like the risks that this film takes won't be for everyone, I personally enjoyed the unorthodox and wild scope of Ant Man's third installment. It goes without saying but Jonathan Majors shines bright as the MCU's new BIG BAD, Kang the Conqueror! Family has always been the pillar of the Ant Man franchise and this was no different. Loved the film. Not perfect by any means but I personally can't wait to see it again!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've seen bad marvel movies, but this one takes the cake. Lots of great elements, but brought together they turned into a cacophony of bland."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"fun, full of great action and visualy stunning. the family aspect still as strong as the first two movies. Quantum realm is a greatly weird place. KANG BANG!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie isn't one of the best, and it's far from one of the worst. The film contains great and funny jokes, however some are at the wrong times. The beginning and middle of the movie are great too, but the end doesn't contain good dialogues, let alone the final fight. The ending and post credits scenes are perfect and make room for several things for the future of the mcu."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was almost the worse movie I have ever seen.  Wish I could get my money back.  I really don't think ANT Man and his family should be a super hero.  This movie was more for a kid 7 and under.  The whole story line and characters were weird.  There were large characters that looked like broccoli.  15 minutes into the movie and I almost fell asleep.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed the movie.  Jonathan Majors is awesome!!!!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"En una pel√≠cula entretenida y de aventuras de principio a fin. Trata de ser √©pica desde el comienzo, pero le cuesta trabajo enganchar al espectador al 100% al inicio, pero una vez el villano principal hace su aparici√≥n todo se vuelve √©pico. Vale la pena volverla a ver y admirar los efectos."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great experience! Jonathan Majors is fantastic and continues to show his range as an actor. Can‚Äôt wait to see him continue with each Kang variant.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! What a great job of opening up a whole new world to us. Loved the story telling and action. And it's great that the door is left open for more movies in the Antman Universe!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Johnathan Majors scene stealing performance made this otherwise mediocre film worth watching!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's an Ant-Man movie with steroids, it tries to catch your attention all the time with some mystery, gags and action, I miss some characters from the last movie like Luis and Kurt, Kang brings the serious touch the movie needed and M.O.D.O.K is cool but kinda underutilized, but it isn't as bad as the critics say, such a fun time"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A blast! Full of meta jokes and callbacks throughout the movie. Doesn't waste your time and gets right into the plot. Sets up an exciting future for the MCU.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast paced film. Quick but effective flashback stories throughout. Phase 5 is gonna be epic. And it looks to be a lot darker than previous phases. 

The only downfall was the ""Disney like"" jokes that were just not needed."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"is good. maybe not as thorough setting up the next part of the store as it could've been, but decent. 
too bad Dr strange wasn't in it."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have not watched such a boring yet terrible movie for a long time. Nobody thinks with their brain, or their brain is the size of an ant. Kang is definitely the worst villain, physically weak and cerebrally damaged. Where are your technologies? Got beaten up by a bunch of ants? Didn't think Steppenwolf has a brother. MODOK, where do I even begin? Did you work in stormtroop?"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie that was fun to watch! More time probably should have been spent explaining why [the secondary villain] was the way he was, but over all I enjoyed it!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think the movie was good I enjoyed seeing a brand new world get introduced into the MCU. The comedy in the movie was great for me I noticed myself laughing a lot during this film also Jonathan Majors did a great job playing Kang the conqueror and I'm sure it will get even better the next time we see him and the end credits are great as well but this is just my opinion
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too convoluted. It was like watching a kids cartoon. The whole plot was beyond dumb!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Good laughs in a full Theatre. Best of the trilogy. Great start to phase 5!
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story was mostly self contained, while still living in the MCU. Good performances from Michelle Pfeiffer, Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors and Kathryn Newton. There weren't many moments for Evangeline Lilly or Michael Douglas to shine, but there were no stinker moments like in many comic adaptations. The story was interesting enough, without requiring a treatise in Marvel knowledge to follow alone. The visuals were interesting, a more flavorful odd world vibe than ""Strange World"" managed, and the characters introduced were fun without being just a bunch of gags. 

Over all the movie was well done, above average for Marvel Movies."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the dynamic between Janet and Kang however, there was little to no character development for Hank, Hope and the father-daughter relation between Scott and Cassie!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was fun and entertaining. Majors killed it which is no surprise. Paul Rudd will always be Paul Rudd and I don't think anyone can be disappointed in that. Critics are clearly oblivious these days. This is a must see for fans and a great movie even if you aren't the biggest comic fan.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"LOVED this movie. It gave me everything I wanted and more. I can't believe the critics scores. I honestly think this is the best Marvel movie since Endgame! The way Scott has evolved his powers and the way he can now fluidly move from small to HUGE is super impressive. The introduction to Kang was incredible and the storyline was amazing! As a die hard Marvel fan, it was a 10/10. If you're not watching everything leading up to this, then I can understand why you might not like it but then it's NOT for you. It for US. The people who consume everything Marvel puts out looking to put together that bigger picture."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved this it had a Star Wars vibe meaning all the beings but I think it had good story and it gave us a small size of how powerful kang is we've seen nothing yet
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love Ant Man, not the best entry into a new phase of Marvel, but not terrible. I laughed at the one liners."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Sat through a two hour movie with a throwaway plot just to promote future Disney+ shows and an Avengers movie not coming out for three years.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang was a great villain, heroes were fun to watch, MODOK disturbingly was pretty cool too. But he was a dick."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not mind-blowing by any means, but I thoroughly enjoyed it as a fan of the previous two Ant-Man movies. Kathryn Newton and Jonathan Majors are highlights for sure"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Long time Marvel Fan seen most of the movies and shows I liked some parts were ehh but overall great movie Kang was great and so was the Ant Man Fam was great
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you liked avatar or are a fan of the mcu,and have been following phase 4 this movie will blow your mind. Great build up for the villain it's only getting started."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was entertaining.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was entertaining and more like the original marvel movies.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Liked:  With Marvel Phased Four really in the final tally leaving me hopeful for a better movie / plot experience... It was nice to see some old favorites that helped build the MCU just do their thing.  Going in to the sub-atomic realm, being the hero there, seems to be a natural extension / expectation of the characters.  And it was entertaining.
It also looks like the MCU has settle on a supper villain for the next set of movies.  I realize there were hints but this is the first real installment of said villain.  Something Phase Four was in dire need of (among other things).  So this is good.
Disliked:  MORDOK was always a odd cartoony character even in the comics.  They managed to expand on the oddness and make him even weirder.  I expect he was there for comic relief, but Antman doesn't take itself too seriously anyway, so... I'm still trying to figure out if that was funny or just weird.
Lastly, I was really hoping a movie like this would open up some of the micronaut characters.  Most notably I was hoping Bug would show up.  I've been waiting for him since Guardians 2.  But we have established the micro-verse so we may yet still see some of these guys.  Here's hoping."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,An unexpected end which was not expected from the movie.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Filme de sess√£o da tarde!
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love Marvel but this was rough. It was like reading the back of an over-designed colorful cereal box while eating plain oatmeal.

SPECIFIC CRITIQUES:
Nobody looked like they wanted to be there, the dialogue was bad even by the somewhat lowered standards of recent Marvel, and a lot of it (for example the ""probability"" scene) seemed like it was directly stolen from Rick and Morty. (Season 2 Episode 1 ""A Rickle in Time"" but also disclaimer since Justin Roiland sucks I can't offer that as a recommendation.)

The cast is good but none of them were giving it anything. There were two exceptions...

Jonathan Majors is a great actor. I think ""The Harder They Fall"" should have gotten way more attention, and I have a sense he's going to crush it in Creed 3, but as Kang....ooof. His performance is like watching a pretentious theater major who's averaging a B+ do a one-man Shakespeare show.

The half-star in my rating is for M.O.D.O.K.. The character's writing and Corey Stoll make this worth watching on Disney+ some evening when you have literally nothing better to do.

I think I'm out on the M.C.U., it's starting to feel like the end of an era. I'd love to be pleasantly surprised because I love Marvel, but. We'll see."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another Marvelous addition to the MCU. 
Fun and all around one of the best MCU films. The after-credit scenes areüî• Thanks Marvel!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie with some really good effects. I love Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, definitely one of my favorite Avengers. KANG was awesome, what an intro for him."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A return to classic form for Marvel movies.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's an excellent superhero movie, critics have no idea why they rated it so low. It has excellent effects, good plot. Totally recommended"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, lighthearted movie with major (?) consequences for the overarching MCU story."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly do not know why this movie isn't being regarded as a consensus top 20 MCU project. Scott's arc is very believable, as he just went from a burglar to the sole reason half the Earth's population was brought back to life, and now he obviously wants to spend time with and get to gather his daughter Cassie. It's much larger scale than anything Ant-Man has been at the forefront of, but nothing about how the plot is necessarily ""too much"". This is the start of a new phase, there should be large stakes and some world building. Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror is unbelievable and I cannot wait for more. I would say Janet Van Dyne's arc isn't perfect, I honestly don't know why a wife and mom wouldn't have said anything in that situation, but it still makes sense. She was beside herself because she helped Kang get his power back. I've heard a lot of flak over the ""tonal issues"", mainly when talking about the Scott Lang quips and MODOK when comparing them to kang and what he does throughout the movie, but I gotta say, I don't see it nearly as much as others do. Scott is easily the least quippy version of him we've seen on screen. Sure there's some super lighthearted bits that when compared to genocide, don't look good, but all of those moments come before Kang is even introduced. When it comes to MODOK, I understand more, but like I said with Janet, it still makes sense. Darrin Cross would obviously work for Kang, especially when Kang's nemesis is Janet Van Dyne. I also don't think MODOK's humor was ever too much. He's a little goofy when he's introduced, but after that, he's much more of a Taskmaster type where he kinda is just a henchman. And he gets a little bit of an arc at the end too, even if the writing for his lines for it are a little goofy. I've watched every single MCU project and I have this movie at 14 on my ranking, edging out projects like Hawkeye, Doctor Strange 2, and Moon Knight."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I really loved Jonathan Majors in this Movie. Michele Pfeiffer was also great but the rest of the movie felt like a huge mess and there was not much character development at all. I could write Marvel a much better script for that movie than they did. But the second post Credit scene was great and I think Loki season 2 has potential.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not a perfect movie, but entertaining enough. Johnathan Majors steals the movie"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Flawless storytelling. Good entertainment throughout.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good humour interspersed with traditional Marvel action and adventure. Terrific visually and standout performances from Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors. My only issue was how quickly the ending resolved the crisis it had created. Overall, one of the best Marvel films of the last few years."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"a good start to mcu phase 5, definitely watch the first 2 ant man movies and loki before hand to freshen up on some details or catch up!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,it was a good movie with a good plot and outstanding cinematography and characters but there were a few things that let me down like the ending and the fact that it wasn't the sort of movie that had waiting in anticipation for something to happen because it was all expected and predictable but overall it was a good movie
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining, but jumped the shark at times!"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Opening was a little slow.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Antman and the Wasp Quantumania is a great example of 'dont believe it until you see it'. This movie definitely doesn't fit the score of <50% rotten tomatoes; I'd say it should be more on the 75-80%. What this movie gets right is its pacing and build up. Kang was done perfectly. We see how the connection between Cassie and Scott improves. CGI was fantastic. The final battle surprised me of how great it really is! There is background story that makes audience learn more about the character and context.

However, there is some flaws like every movie, but not flaws that significantly impacts and ruins the whole movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it , action was great , story great , funny , and Jonathan major's performance was impeccable"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a absolute spectacle that captures the vast alien cultures alike of starwars while balancing both suspense and light comedy from the predecessors and Jonathan Majors Kang instils fear like that of Vader.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its good. Amazing performance from Paul Rudd, Jonathan Major, and the rest of the cast.However the MODOK character is wasted. But Kang the conqueror is amazing!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie I have ever seen !!!! Ant man dies by the way. Andrew Garfield is in the movie as well as Tom holland. Toby magurie  aka the goat also shows up. Tony stark comes back as a zombie! Every  character shows up to the movie. Must see! Your mind will be blown
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It maintains the pattern of the other Ant-Man films - not epic, but good and funny. Kang is a very terrific villain."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A ""trippy"" movie at times, but you have to expect some creativity and weirdness in the quantum realm. 
Kang is a solid, complex villain that elevates the entire movie.
Don't expect this to be like the other Ant-Man movies, but it's better than critics suggest. Worth the watch."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst Marvel movie ever made.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Changed my mind on this film. After i watched it for the first time i gave it a 7/10, that has now changed to a 4/10. Annoying characters and a filler movie to lead up to future avengers movies. 4/10, only watch if you're going through the MCU."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lackluster, predictable,  definition of Cashing in.  Pretty sure I'm done spending the money to take my family to Marvel movies."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely a family movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pel√≠cula entretenida donde la actuaci√≥n de Kang es fenomenal, cumple con lo que muestra en trailer, te da una antesala a futuros eventos"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I missed some of the characters from the first two but this is a great movie and a great start to 2023. Don't believe the critics who are just mad it wasn't woke enough for them.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-man and The Wasp: Quantumania has a lot to say about the current state of the studio. Mostly bad things. Since I saw the trailer I was preparing myself for a Marvel movie that wouldn't be great (as it have been for the last couple of years for Marvel Studios, might I add), but man, was I wrong about how bad it would be. With a highly predictable plot, characters that lack any interesting trait (be it either sympathetic or hateful), one of the most detestable comic relief antagonist who comes straight from the uncanny valley and incoherent childish dialogue, you could as well have said that this movie was written by a clearly newborn and unexperienced AI. If anything, the movie reveals about a much bigger picture regarding the company behind the studio (Walt Disney Studios) which has been doing soulless movies that repeat a formula that's been dated for at least the last decade."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie meets but doesn't exceed the expectations. Completely different from the previous Ant Man movies. Found a nice balance of humor and seriousness in the movie. The movie doesn't have many weak points. It's a fun and enjoyable MCU film.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A solid Marvel / action movie. While it wasn't as inspired as Ant-Man 1 (with the Big / Small / proportions humor), the most important thing about the movie is that this truly sets the stage (finally!) for Marvel Phase 5 & 6 (this ""2nd Story Arc"" in the MCU after Thanos and the Infinity Stones saga). 

Both End Credits scenes are worth sticking around for, as they add more to the upcoming saga and storyline. We're finally getting some traction here and it's slowly building up excitement again. 

The story is solid, but could've been a bit more inspired. There are lots of new faces, new races that appear, and it's all a bit ""faceless"" (too much, too fast (you have try and care about them in the span of a couple hours)), but otherwise, entertaining, and again, it sets up the MCU's 2nd major storyline."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst marvel movie to date! Way to kill a franchise üëçüèæ
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Didn't like this at all.  First the stones don't mean anything in Loki and now we have unlimited multiverses.  The Multiverse is lazy.  That means they can make any rules they want.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film. Jonathan Majors does great as Kang as well as on the heroes side too! Paul Rudd is still as charming and funny as he was in his previous appearances. The two post credits scenes were also very enjoyable and fun. I do not understand the negative reviews about this movie. I saw a story myself and the effects and look of everything is amazing. Would recommend to see with a group of friends. Had an amazing time!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It;s a weird, fun, ride!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie does NOT deserve the negative reviews and ratings it is getting. It sticks with the humor of the Ant Man movies and has Paul Rudd being his best self. It was great to see the Ant Man family (Rudd, Douglas, Pfeiffer, and Lilly) return. Kathryn Newton was great as Cassie. Sure, the exposition and first act might be boring and a bit too long, with some forced humor, but once Kang enters, it gets a lot better. Jonathan Majors is very talented and fantastic as the new big bad, as he shows us that Kang is the real deal. The visuals were also really enjoyable to look at, especially in 3D. Overall, 8/10."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Totally predictable movie, very bland"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Felt like pre-endgame marvel. Fun, action packed with great pacing. Kang is a beast."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"If this is a sign of what's to come from Jonathan Majors count me in, he's terrifically tyrannical as Kang the conqueror. 
The film worked for me as an excursion into the quantum realm but I can't help feeling that the amount of story, characters and exposition would be better as a series to give things more time to develop and then make the pay off feel more earned. 
The movie also seemed to embrace becoming extremely cheesy in parts, I guess when you're dealing with characters like M.O.D.O.K some degree of goofiness will have to be present.

Most of the returning cast have good enough story points and all members seem to fit their roles pretty well, 

All in quantumania is a crazy, delightful, trippy journey topped off with an emotionally charged showdown and a movie that more than suits as an addition to the ant man series."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome job at kicking off phase 5. Kept the humor we love from the Antman movies while having great action, awesome performances by all, and was absolutely stunning visually."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was ok. But the IMAX 3D definitely enhanced the experience for me!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I can see why it is looked down upon... But, I've been following everything from the MCU from day one and I'm a huge Sci-fi fan. I really enjoyed this movie but I do understand why some people won't like this."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critic score for this movie should tell you more about Rotten Tomatoes than the movie itself. I'm not sure what these critics are expecting but this was a really good movie. Solid storyline, Rudd gonna Rudd and Majors is on the verge of mega stardom. Criticizing a movie for too much CGI in a Quantam Realm (!!!!!) is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. How else do you suggest they pull that off? The CGI looked good. Writing could've been better but it wasn't bad.  The only down side was Douglas. I felt his timing was off in every scene he was in. Otherwise, this movie is worth the time and money"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was unique and very beautiful movie, i recommend to watch."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme traz uma experi√™ncia muito v√°lida. 
Precisamos ser realistas para os problemas com CGI e roteiro, fato. 
Mas o filme √© bonito, criativo e vale a pena ser assistido. As doses de humor s√£o equilibradas e o Scott Lang mostra que √© um vingador de verdade. Kang √© uma obra de arte e tanto Michelle Pfeiffer quanto Michael Douglas mostram por que s√£o profissionais t√£o respeitados internacionalmente e as surpresas dos p√≥s cr√©ditos s√£o fenomenais."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie, its true that Modok was unnecessary but I think maybeeee I don't know but maybe he didn't die, he only wanted a way to leave Kang? Maybe he's still alive? Who knows. Maybe Marvel can save the fail of Modok in this movie and give him a serious rol in the future. Overall it was great movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing, I CANNOT wait to see where this goes next. Highly recommended!!!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A show stealing villain and some impressive visuals aren't enough to save an uninspired, cookie-cutter movie that I'll most likely forget in a week."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly it wasn't the best movie ever BUT it does not deserve all the hate it has gotten. I would recommend checking it out if you saw the Loki tv series first however
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,There were really no surprises and yet this movie is another must see for any fans of the Multiverse!  I know that Thanos will eventually meet Kang!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The spectacle in itself is great. Feels like a good star wars movie. The villains are intimidating and goofy (in a very good comic book way). It feels like there are stakes. The movie has a few moments which could have been done better but as does every one. Every character gets a chance to shine and have their moment.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,For me the way the movie was made was spectacular. The humor really worked and i laughed at almost every joke. The relationship between scott and cassie was just so powerful. I really enjoyed this film. Kang was a brutal and a amazing character. I will most defenetly watch it alot. Just amazing
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing fighting scenes, perfect visual effect"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I honestly think it's a good movie I mean like theres a few parts in the movie that eh. But honestly for the start of marvels phase 4 I think it's good introducing more new villains and heroes to the MCU. You should watch it from my POV I guess it was a good movie to watch.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good movie. Not the same flare as Thor or Wakanda Forever. Not the best introduction to a new antagonist.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I walked into this movie with very low expectations and walked out very satisfied. It's not a perfect film, but it's a fun time at the movies, and that's all I expect from an action adventure movie about a man who shrinks to the size of an ant. If you believe a man can do that, you can believe everything else that happens in this film. Enjoy it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Story was good, visual effects and CGI were stunning."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fun, eye-popping visuals, and a bit of a Lost In Space vibe as the whole Ant Family gets itself stranded/ works through its issues. Enjoyed every minute. It's not going to change the world, but if you are looking for an entertaining superhero night out, it is spot on."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Exciting and full of action..
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"DUDE! I don't want to over-hype this movie. Is it just another regular Marvel movie? Yes. But GOSH DARN IT I love it so much! Kang and MODOK are some of my favorite characters, and they were portrayed excellently on screen. There were so many moments I fangirled, and as an adult male, that has gotta say something. I have loved the Antman movies for years, and this movie further confirms it as one of my favorite solo Marvel characters. Doctor Strange MoM and Thor LaT have got nothing on this! Great return to normal by Marvel!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was fun, engaging, visually exciting and I thought there was a great balance of action, humour and seriousness.  The relationship between Scott Lang and his daughter was touching, Johnathon Majors was excellent as Kang and Michelle Pfeiffer was a pleasant surprise.   This was a fun time at the movies and when it was over I turned to my buddy and said, this movie flew by!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The story felt lacking the essence of any film, to entertain. The film left a feeling of the incoherence of where this is all going, and even though there was an attempt to it, it was lacking, again, that hook that a film need to be enjoyable."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was better than most of the phase 4 movies. I enjoyed seeing how all three An-Man movies were tied together. I enjoyed seeing another heroine. I enjoyed seeing a new villain who seems omnipotent. However, this film seemed to lack information. The beginning dragged for a while & then picked up once the story started to have some substance. I also loved the end credits scenes!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome i dont care what anyone says. This the best movie of phase 5 100%
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Really good and fun! Loved Kang! Not so much MODOK, but in general no way what ""critics"" are saying, who figures! Yes, it's not perfect or groundbreaking, but I enjoy it more than Wakanda Forever."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not as bad as some critics make it sound, but still, its a ""meh"" at best. 50% is a fair score for this movie.

CGI: Between average and mediocre.
Action: Usually predictable, with only one or two creative scenes.
Combat Choregraphy: Bad guy shoots beams and uses telekinesy, sometimes. Nothing remarkable.
Humor: Not bad, there are unexpected situational twists.
Plot: Bad guy wants something, kidnaps good guy familly member to get that thing.
Wit: None. Its blunt and highly predictable. No 10th level twists here.
Acting: Bad guy tries hard to make a mark, but the script is too bad for him to really do something interesting. The rest of the cast dont even act. they just say things.

Better seen home streaming."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best Ant-Man movie so far. This one really did have some good acting and not all jokes.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thats good movie, easy to understand, easy to see."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not at all like the first two movies, which I really enjoyed, more like Star Wars. I miss Scott's friends."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Me ha parecido entretenida y muy disfrutable.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best marvel movie in a while.  Great story, great villain (Loki show on Disney) ‚Ä¶ good movie fun and excitement.  The marvel universe is back on track after two weak stories over past year ( Thor & Wakanda üëéüèΩ)"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sinceramente me pareci√≥ una gran pel√≠cula. 
Me ha encantado como se explica y se profundiza en el mundo cu√°ntico, entre los personajes destacan Ant-Man (gran h√©roe y sobre todo un gran padre el cu√°l demuestra que har√≠a cualquier cosa por su hija), Cassie (una gran inclusi√≥n al UCM, a pesar de cometer alg√∫n que otro error tiene buenas intenciones y lucha por hacer el bien) y por √∫ltimo pero no menos importante Kang (un villano imponente aunque no llega al nivel de Thanos, est√° cegado por su gran poder y aniquila a todo aquel que se interpone en su camino o no obedece sus √≥rdenes). 
Personalmente me han encantado otros personajes secundarios como ser√≠an Hope y la inclusi√≥n de Modok a pesar de no parecerse al visto anteriormente en los c√≥mics.
La trama no es algo de otro mundo, destaca por encima de esta sus incre√≠bles mundos y habitantes con un estilo a lo Star Wars.
En cuanto a los efectos especiales y el CGI no me han parecido malos aunque si mejorables, he quedado satisfecho que estos.
Recomendar√≠a ver la pel√≠cula, es entrenida, √©pica y no hace un uso excesivo de la comedia.
Es importante no ir pensando que vas a ver EndGame 2.0 si no una pel√≠cula de AntMan, por todo esto y lo anteriormente mencionado le doy 4,5 estrellas, me ha encantado."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Brilliant start of phase 5. The stakes are up. You can feel it in the fabric of the movie. Impressive work done with the creation of the quantum universe/world. Jonathan Majors has Gravitas second to none. He truly embodies Kang. Strap yourself in for an out of this world ride! Phase 5 will blow our minds
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was a great time with some lacklustre moments.

The entire cast does a great job with the stand outs being Scott and kang. 

The story was a run of the mill marvel movie with themes of family and being a hero for the little people. But despite the simple story it does a great job with. 

Fight scenes were great which has always been a great part of the Antman franchise since they use the powers in creative ways. 

If the film had a weak part then it would have to be the pacing, because unlike most movies I feel like this one could have used an extra 15 or so minutes to expand on kang and gives us a clearer image of how kang as the concept works.

The cgi is also hit and miss, some scenes look great whilst others look kind of bad (think the rhinos in black panther 1) but thankfully it's better than most of the current marvel things.

This is the definition of a solid marvel movie, if you like marvel movies watch it, if you don't then just skip it.

Also the jokes land almost all the time, lots of laughs from the audience."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great movie.  No 3D as advertised. I expected at least a HD projection.  No joy here. Regal theaters are clean with nice powered recliners, however, spent 25 on hot dog, next to small popcorn and a next to small soda (Pepsi), tasting like cough syrup.  I will never do this again at Regal. Guess I am spoiled after enjoying movies at Cinimark."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It‚Äôs great if you‚Äôre a more hardcore MCU fan and can enjoy the Easter eggs and connections. It would be slower or outlandish for a casual. It‚Äôs a solid setup movie to introduce the conqueror and setup secret wars.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie better than most recent Marvel films. 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The overall telling was Very Good with some awesome Bits, One Liners and Gags sprinkled in. The Mid-Credit Scene was a nice setup for what is ahead and the Post-Credit Scene teased the next season of Loki very well."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Ablsoite must see highaffff y‚Äôall greatastot film of all time
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Scott and Cassie father and daughter performance was over the top. Also Kang stole the show in every scene he was in. You can see why Kang is well geared.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing! Action packed with subtle humor. Kang Will Return! Hahaha
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie. It gets better as it goes along and the bizarre world they created is beautiful on the big screen. Majors kills as Kang and I am looking forward to seeing him in Loki and the Kang Dynasty.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not sure why the critics reviews are poor. I thought this movie was good. It was different and sets up the next villain
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,So good! Cant wait until the next movie!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was really great.  Jonathan Majors was amazing plus you literally get a lot of him in the movie.  Best thing is they didn't overdo it with the humor.  It's there only one possibly cringe comedy moment but it was done well enough to give it a pass. There wasn't a huge amount of action for the first half of the movie but when the action began it felt well done and rewarding.  The visuals felt beautiful to me and the character creations felt fresh.  A very CGI heavy film that the critics hate but the hate is unnecessary because it was well done.  The one gripe I have is with the ending I felt it would have benefited from a darker ending, they had 2 different opportunities to take it in a darker but not horrific direction and they didn't pull the trigger on either.  But it is a Marvel/Disney film so I understand.  All in all a great movie.  I would watch it again in the theater."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the movie, fun, Majors delivers a Kang that is both truthful and over the top, which for a comic book movie is well suited, MODOK is the same, as well as the other characters. Ant-Man has a growth within his story suitable for a trilogy finale and a beautiful start to Marvel's Phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not sure why all the hate. It's crazy and unique. Kang is great and so is Ant Man himself. I'd rather see a swing for weird and different than cookie cutter
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,fun and entertaining
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny characters, good action, great visuals, lotsa twists and turns."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally a good Marvel movie for 2023.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was totally awesome and I hope everyone who loves Marvel films watches it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Love how Kang the Conqueror didn't disappoint in his debut. Now I wanna see how hes going to get down on the Avengers secret wars
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was an enjoyable return to the MCU and the world of Antman. A fun ride of whimsy and fantastical battles, this was my favorite of the trilogy. Jonathan Majors is fire, as the new big bad. There are some pacing issues at times, and some of the jokes don't hit like in previous a movies, but overall another good installment to the MCU library."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie!!!! Not the best but was so fun!!! Would def watch watch again!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than avatar 2 by a country mile
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie cool kang the concora was the beast villain I can't wait for avengers 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I am  surprised by how much i liked this movie. It¬ßs not perfect but its very far from the bad reviews I read on internet. The story is captivating and I really liked the original wasp and Kant storyline.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, Majors stole EVERY scene he was in and the relationships shown between the 2 families (Cassie and Scott. Hope, Hank and Janet) were amazing. Act 1 was a bit slow however once Kang was perfect!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie, the future is bright for the MCU"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Se voc√™ vai ver o filme achando que est√° vendo Ultimato, voc√™ vai-se decepcionar. Agora se voc√™ vai ver o filme como uma pessoa normal achando que vai ver um filme normal de fam√≠lia do Homem-Formiga com a presen√ßa intensa do Kang, voc√™ vai gostar. Primeiro lugar, os personagens: os personagens s√£o legais e bem interpretados. Segundo lugar, a fotografia e o CGI: achei a fotografia e os cen√°rios bem bonitos e bem feitos, eu gostei. Obvio que voc√™ est√° vendo e sabe que √© CGI at√© porque voc√™ n√£o √© NOOB assistindo filmes de super-her√≥is mas √© bem feito. Terceiro lugar, a hist√≥ria: n√£o √© nada inovador e revolucion√°rio, mas √© gostoso de acompanhar. Eu curti a hist√≥ria. A Trilha sonora √© generiquinha, nada como Shang-chi ou Pantera Negra, mas √© legalzinho. Agora a n√≠vel do enredo no universo Marvel eu curti o facto de contextualizarem a hist√≥ria do Kang e acho que esse filme √© importante para o futuro sim, visto que no fim temos a reuni√£o das variantes do Kang e uma cena p√≥s-credito com o Loki da s√©rie. √Å primeira vista n√£o parece muito que vai est√° no enredo do MCU, mas n√≥s ainda nem vimos o desenrolar disso. Esse filme vai dar alguma repercuss√£o em filmes futuros, como Vingadores: Dinastia Kang e obvio, a segunda temporada de Loki.
Os dois pontos negativos que tenho a ressaltar √© o facto do Kang ter sido derrotado. Gostaria que ele tivesse ganho, mas ele n√£o deve ter ganho porque n√£o √© a hora, assim como aconteceu no filme dos Vingadores 2012. O que de facto me deixou um pouco chateada foi o facto dele ter sido derrotado de uma maneira um pouco estupida e r√°pida, sendo que ele √© muito forte. Outro ponto negativo foi o MODOK. Ele √© bizarro e feio, mas de certa maneira acho que essa era a ideia.
Gostei do Filme! V√£o assisti-lo com a mente s√£."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!!! Must watch movie don‚Äôt believe the critics bunch of haters
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie overall and doesn't really feel rushed like other recent Marvel titles. Jonathan Majors is amazing in every scene, and Paul Rudd and Kathryn Newton work amazingly together as the father and daughter role of Scott Lang and Cassie Lang. overall an amazing film!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure why this movie is getting so much hate. I had a blast watching it. It starts out phase 5 with a bang. Pure Sci-Fi nerd bliss. Exploring the quantum realm, Kang the conqueror, modok, humor, nostalgia, this movie had it all for me. It's not perfect, but it's worth the watch."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pues a m√≠ me ha gustado Ant Man Quantumania. Sin spoilers, es una pel√≠cula muy disfrutable, entretenida y visualmente muy guay el mundo cu√°ntico. Tiene un rollo star wars en el tema de conocer criaturas y sitios nuevos . Y sobretodo , de AVENTURAS. Algo que se estaba perdiendo. Pero lo mejor de la pel√≠cula es sin duda el villano, Kang. Todo el misterio alrededor de √©l al principio de la peli y lo que impone cada vez que aparece, brutal. Y muy bien actuado. Lo que se puede venir con este villano es muy interesante y muy grande 
Por supuesto tiene cosas malas , la primera parte es un poco lenta , como siempre algunos chistes que no hacen gracia, dos o tres conveniencias muy grandes y un personaje llamado M.O.D.O.K. que los que sab√©is un poco de Marvel, entender√©is la decepci√≥n

En fin , pel√≠cula divertida y llena de la esencia de Ant Man . Si buscas un soldado invierno, un Infinity war, ese nivel... Obviamente saldr√°s decepcionado. Pero si sabes a lo que vas , cumple ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Aside from typical marvel (bad cgi/crappy one-liners/etc.), I struggle to find what people find so bad about this movie. Don't get me wrong, it isn't peak marvel or anything but I think the humor was not at all overdone, the plot was interesting, and I think it did it's job as a phase 5 set-up movie. Though ""wasp"" is in the title, she was severely underused but not to a terrible extent. I genuinely sat through the movie waiting for it to get as bad as everyone was saying but I never found it. Solid entry and definitely better than expected with how their films/tv shows have been recently."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing very exciting
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Thought this was awesome. Really enjoyable. Great Ant-man movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Without trying to read into reviews that seem to be out to nitpick, at face value this movie was extremely enjoyable. It was fun and kept me excited and intrigued at every turn. I've never expected anything more than a fun and immersive movie experience and Marvel delivered again as it almost always does. Nitpick all you want, but don't forget to have fun. That's what all these movies are about!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie.  A bit Star Wars-ish, but a great mix of sci-fi, comedy,  action, super-heroism, and heart. Worlds better than Ant-man 2. Awesome job. A+"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was actually pretty good! This is coming from someone who hated She-Hulk and Thor Love and Thunder, and thought Black Panther 2 was okay not bad. I don't know why the critics gave it such bad reviews, if it were at 70% or even 60% I guess I can understand, but 50% and lower? That's not a fair score at all. Must be some political reason the critics gave it a bad score. Highly recommend you watch it yourself and form your own opinion."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie definitely gave me the marvel hype since No Way Home. Johnathan Majors is outstanding as Kang and Paul Rudd is just playing Paul Rudd and the post credit scenes are amazing
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania is a classic adventure story. The film is not trapped in a single plot we have lots of arcs being arcs being worked, and it¬¥s so good in my vision we have: the quantum population arc and their dissatisfaction and hatred with Kang on the command, we have Janet van Dyne and Kang emotional relationship, and of course Ant-Man and her Daughter relationship; and is amazing how everything gets connected in the end. The final battle of course is the best since Endgame. So my final grade will be 3.5 of 5. It¬¥s the best one of phase 4 and 5.
PS: this riview was writed before Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3, The Marvels etc..."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors is a great Kang, and overall the movie was very entertaining. While I do not think it was the best marvel movie let alone the best ant man movie, I am happy I went and saw it. There was great action scenes and the story was very good, the visuals were fantastic (I recommend 3D). Would watch again, but not S tier."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Tried and failed to do Guardians of the galaxy. Hammy writing and too many gags meant that the emotional and funny beats just didn't land.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie is a classic example of the MCU not learning its lesson. This movie disappointed me while also managing to be a thrilling movie setting up the future of phase 5. This movie was at its best when Kang was on screen and the center of attention and he simply wasn't enough. The quantum realm bits were cool and there's room to explore but overall this movie didn't balance tone and writing well enough to be top tier.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It had enjoyable scenes, but it was very much just a setup for future movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Doesn't quite nail down a tone or the stakes, but it was beautiful to behold and certainly entertaining. Full of wild creativity. Kang is one dangerous baddie too."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantmania was everything some of the latest marvel movies was not. Unlike movies like Thor: Love and Thunder it didn't trade when you over with slapstick goofiness. It was an actual movie which laid the groundwork for the next phase of marvel movies. Like some of the more serious action/drama marvel movies made 10 years ago like the original Thor or Iron Man, it had humor in it, and yeah, it over played a couple jokes, but overall it was very good. 
 If you're looking for haw haw, wink wink nudge nudge marvel type of a movie, then this one probably wouldn't be for you but I liked it. 
 I even liked it better than Black Adam or Avatar the Way of Water, which goes to show that just because a critic says one thing doesn't mean the average viewer can't have a different opinion."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic! The poor reviews are insane, this film had a perfect balance of humour and seriousness. The idea of the quantum realm is great and the producers captured the idea of it perfectly with the different species etc. visually gorgeous. Massive upgrade from Love and Thunder"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some gentle comedy at times, great cast, fast-moving."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How much acid did the person take that came up with this plot line.  It was so dumb and unbelievable, I found Guardians of the Galaxy to be more believable."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie. It wasn't the best Marvel movie out there, but it was fun, lots of action, and a great upbeat escape to enjoy. I don't get what the critics are ever watching as too many of them seem to want to try and show how they are relevant with little regard to the audience that will watch the movie. If you like light hearted Marvel Movies it is a must see."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Was this film perfect? No but all the haters are full of it! This movie was fun and all the characters are great in their own way. Johnathan Majors is fantastic as KANG!!! Can't wait to see him fight the Avengers!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I quite enjoyed it! It's not perfect but it's still much better than Thor 4 or Dr. Strange 2!
Don' t inderstand the critics score, i guess they are hiting on it because of the previous recet MCU projects?!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved the movie. All the moments with Cassie stole my heart. And the dynamic between her and her father were just pure gold. At first I was worried because of all the negative reviews but I don't get the hate as my personal experience was very pleasant.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Majors stole the entire movie. Not the best, but better than Thor Love and Thunder."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,GREAT MOVIE. Other than the original marvel cheesy dialogue
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I truly don't understand why this movie is being cruelly ripped apart. This was SUCH an exciting film!! It felt more like a thrilling space opera more so than Guardians does. Kang is terrifying, Scott is such a great character to continually watch grow (no pun) and the rest of all the characters bring such great energy to this story. This HURLS the MCU into such a wild and terrifying new journey. Extremely enjoyable film and a fantastic next chapter for the MCU, let alone a GREAT way to begin Phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,So great in 3D really gives the best feel through the quantum realm !!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A very fun watch and a great introduction to Kang. Extremely satisfying ending and very funny.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Since Endgame, there has been a lot of Marvel content, and a lot of it has been sub par, I've enjoyed them, but there was nothing to get me really excited. Ant-Man Quantumania has brought back that special Marvel feeling, it gives us the heroes going on a journey, and learning about a new world, and the dangers that come with it. The highlight is Jonathan Major's Kang, I mean wow, I just can't seem to find the right word to express how I feel about him, the character, the acting, the lines, the physical expressions, it was all perfect, I want and need more Kang, and knowing that Kang is the next major Threat, I'm excited to see all projects he is apart of."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"OK! Let's go! Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) Spoiler free review: I'm biased to say the least, because Scott is one of my favorite superheroes. But man, it's not because I like him, or maybe it is; But this film is spectacular, I have no words to describe this film, describe the details, the moments with Cassie are very cute is what I like most about Scott. Paul Rudd's performance as Ant-Man is amazing and iconic as ever. The film is not as heavy as the trailer, it has its Ant-Man moments, if you know what I mean. Evangeline Lilly perfect as always and as everyone already knows, the costume is perfect, similar to the comics and the hair uuuh, amazing. we see a greater presence of a character that we know little about and mysteries will be revealed, which ones? Go watch to find out. Jonathan Majors as Kang, perfect, I have nothing to say about this villain, this performance, he gave it his all and a little more, I wouldn't give anything for him, but now I'm believing in his potential, and yes! He's going to give a little work, because if you watch the movie you'll see the work he gives to the Lang family. Kathryn Newton what can I say? At first I was like, man, they changed Cassie and didn't warn the poor other actress, but if there was a character that surprised me, it was this one, I didn't give a damn for young Cassie, sorry, but she ""broke everything"" and this actress did everything and a little more for this character, and that costume of hers? (Which appeared in the trailer) perfect! I have no other words to describe this movie. This was a proud FUCK THE CRITICS, (sorry critics) foot-slapping movie, there's only one thing I didn't like and I can't reveal it but it has to do with M.O.D.O.K. Before talking about the grade I give to this movie... Post credits scenes. 1st Scene - this was certainly the most anticipated, only marvete who understands how important this scene is for the next films. (But Nis (my name), why does only marvete understand? I answer him, because there were people who thought this scene was too little, and called it a shit scene) but it is a scene that will be essential for the mcu. Scene 2- I totally freaked out and didn't hear her dialogue, but let me tell you, it's epic because we have someone working on something already! Who will be? We'll only find out when we see Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Note: 9 with praise Thank you Marvel, Paul and the cast for such an amazing movie and for not letting me down ."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The visuals are amazing! Jonathan Majors really stepped into character and was phenomenal throughout the movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched the movie today and I can say that sometimes the review exaggerates, movie is nice. she didn't promise much but she delivered what you had..."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I hope they reset everything and start back again from another universe with logic-trama movies. It's always going worse
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was genuinely funny and I think sets up for one of the best villain arcs in the whole MCU. Thanos was pretty great, but you didn't truly get to see how powerful he was until end game. Kang is terrifying from the beginning and lays a great foundation for Phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Another 3D printed production. as of most of phase 4. Any filmmaker with any or vision or talent has already worked for marvel. and are fed up with having one hand tied behind their back. With limited creative freedom.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was just‚Ä¶ fun. And set up a lot going forward. Overall‚Ä¶ I just had a good time.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved this movie! It was fun, exciting, had great characters and sets the stage for Phase Five well."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A sad end to what was a good run.  Over CGI'd and all the good, warm elements removed.  Come on Marvel - you can do way better."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Omg absolutely loved this movie! Not sure why critics on rotten tomatoes gave it a 48% score on the tomato meter, but the audience score of 85% is spot on! So many twists and turns in this movie, so much to unpack, kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Lots of parallels to Star Wars and futuristic societies with multiple different beings living together. Utterly stunning cinematography & graphics as well (we saw it in 3D). I would rank this a 9/10, and right next to Avengers Infinity War. Definitely recommend for families & Marvel Cinematic Universe fans!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't believe the Negative Reviews, they trippin'
this was a great start for the next phase in Marvel, best Ant Man movie to date!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"ENTRETENIDA, Y PARA LO QUE SE VIENE,  CUMPLE COMO ANTESALA"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Spoiler free - I thought it was a very good and gripping story and a wonderful introduction to Kang the Conqueror and I'm excited to see where it goes from here. However some of the VFX could do with some work but most of it was very appeasing visually. With this edition of Ant Man Paul Rudd was fantastic and Jonathan Majors is going to make a wonderful edition to the MCU.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Went to be entertained. Enjoyed it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,NEED. MORE. KANG. Terrific blend of the humor of the Ant-Man movies and the introduction of the new surreal threat of the MCU. It delivers the most important message in the history of the MCU‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never too late to stop being a d***‚Äù
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Mira yo creo que la pel√≠cula est√° genial, para los que hab√©is votado tan mal...¬°CHICOS ES UNA PELI DE ANTMAN NO ES SPIDERMAN 26! Est√° entretenida, no vay√°is aqu√≠ con el list√≥n de Jesucristo porque es una peli que est√° bien, el cgi est√° bien, est√° graciosa, es m√°s √©pica que las dos entregas anteriores, esq yo no s√© qu√© os esperabais de una peli de antman, que apareciera reed Richards en un caballo volador llevando en brazos a Toby y a Chuck Norris???? Pues no macho, creo que hab√©is sido injustos con esta peli porque no es para ponerle la mierda de cr√≠tica que le est√°is poniendo, est√° de puta madre"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it better than 48% not trusting movie reviews anymore
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Loved seeing Kang and Scott on screen together!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,What I like about is that I make sure I have a gift card to purchase any tickets to watch a movie whenever I want if I like it or not.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Far from first two Ant-Man's flow but due to kang. Kang introduced needed to be quicker. Great prologue for kang. Great end credits. MORE kang
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rick and Morty aura all over the script but a bit limited to fit into the MCU storytelling.
Some characters where missed, but the new additions to the roster provide a good comic relief.
Majors is awesome ! Rudd shines and the chemistry with Newton is amazing. Fresh movie!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not terrible, not great. It was ok. Cassie and MODOK are awful, as is Hope's haircut. WTF was she thinking? Her Mother looks more attractive than she does. Sadly, Antman is not even the hero of his own film: all the supporting characters are. The storyline is ok, but it's just too weird. It's also nowhere near as funny as the previous two films. 

Kang is excellent, and it was great to see Hank Pimm do his thing. End credits are also well worth staying for."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I was entertained.  Not my favorite Ant Man though!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was actually pretty entertaining, people just be hating for no reason. It's better than Ms. Marvel"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lot of action. Not much story.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The CGI and the acting of Jonathan Majors are high points. I thought Kathryn Newton did well and she‚Äôll grow into the role of this new, young hero. Paul Rudd is the ideal Ant-Man. I wish Wasp had more to do and that there had been some lasting consequences at the conclusion, but I‚Äôm sure the consequences will make themselves known later. I enjoyed it and I think Kang will continue to be a force in the MCU. "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know why this movie has been getting so much hate, it was the best Marvel movie by far. Kang the Conqueror was so badass. There wasn't a dull moment in this movie for me which is crazy because I watched reviews of the movie before I went to go see it and I almost decided that it wasn't worth the watch, but I thank God I went. Highly recommend everyone to go watch this movie, most of the haters are comic book diehards. I freakin loved this movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. Critics are wrong yet again. Keep up the good work.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Really like this one. Kang is a beast.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,High action with lots of cool VFX.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Very entertaining and full of great ant man action. Don't know what these RT chumps are talking about.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wanted to like it ...but it was just awful Same old story line bad acting ..Kang was the only positive .
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A good movie to start Phase 5 in MCU, Kang is a real villian, he is smarter than Thanos"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story line, they took a brake from the heavy slap stick humor. Still funny in areas but not too much."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Please stop criticizing the movie for being filler and for setting up other movies as all the Ant-Man movies have always been. The first one was the end of Phase 2 after Ultron and second one was the palate cleanser after Infinity War and the setup for Endgame.  So take this movie for the fun ride it is. It's not the world ending stakes of an Avengers movie, nor should it be.  But it's a fun 2 hours."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jonathan Majors was by far the highlight of this outrageous movie. Marvel is going completely down hill. I had high ups for this movie, and I'm a huge Marvel fan. Peyton Reed, you've done a TERRIBLE job!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of exciting fight scenes and the importance of family. 
Plus staying close to the true comic stories is awesome."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"(SPOILER WARNING) Johnathan Majors as Kang was phenomenal. He is very dark, serious and very strong. We know he is not dead or at least we know that at least the other variants are alive and will return. But my biggest question is why not let him win and at least let Ant-Man and Co just be able to leave the quantum realm? The movie is entertaining besides a slow scene in the middle of the movie and besides the ants being able to eat away all his tech, it is very well paced. Other than that the movie is very good, love the comic book iterations on the big screen in live action is cool and the post credit scenes have me excited for the future of the MCU. Biggest and best Ant-Man yet! Critics score should be higher and is way better than MOM"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are high on something this movie was sick! Better than the recent Thor
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,the best Ant-Man movie to date. Johnathan Majors understood the assignment as portraying Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie not sure why critics giving such low score I woulda gave it five stars if MODOK wasn't in it he was only thing I didn't like but the movie as a hole was epic I feel people forget these are kids movies
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Darren. This is a masterpiece. The dude with the holes got me in the feels. The floating ships were elegantly shaped, and Darren's death brought me to tears."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,great way to set up the next Phase of Marvel Movies!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,My husband & I loved it!  Jonathan Majors is amaz!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics are so wrong. This movie was fantastic witn the action and little bit of comedy thrown in. This movie needs to be seen in theatres.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was an amazing start to Phase 5. People have to remember, this is just the beginning. Kang makes Thanos look like an ant, no pun intended."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunningly and beautiful Quantum Realm come to life, great cast and it has Kang the conqueror!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had no expectations going in, but had fun"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Another bad Marvel movie. The M-She U still at it with another bad plot. The CGI is absolutely embarrassing for 2023. Again save your money. Maybe watch it on Disney- (when it‚Äôs released) with your borrowed friends password. Let‚Äôs hope Guardians is a bit better.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not the best Ant-Man Movie but still a good ride from Marvel. Kang carried that movie a lot!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think ""critics"" spend too much time trying to be a contrarian...for nothing. The movie was an 8/10."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While there are some storytelling decisions that dampen the enjoyment of this movie it's a fun, visually spectacular ride."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rarely write reviews but seeing a lot of negative ones from critics and just coming out of the cinema, I thought: why not?

As a big MCU fan I was a bit nervous going into this movie after reading some the critics reviews. So I sat there and watched it, and‚Ä¶ I really liked it!

Now, this is not on Endgame and No Way Home level, but it doesn‚Äòt has to be. To me it's a great movie, on its own as well as part of the connected story of the MCU. So yeah, I really enjoyed this one, and all others with me at the cinema did too.

Maybe critics are tired of Marvel movies? I don't know. But I‚Äòm sure a lot of fans and movie goers in general are not. And to those, who still very much enjoy the MCU and look forward to what‚Äòs to come within its movies as well as the overarching story, Quantumania is definitely worth a trip to the cinema."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant start to Phase 5! Don't listen to critics they always get it wrong and honestly, I don't know how they still have jobs.
Well Done Marvel! Much better than the travesty of Phase 4 (not including Spiderman 3)"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good film, visuals were great, especially in 3D, even better film if you are a dedicated Marvel fan but great intruductory point for casuals, post credit scene were great aswell."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The main story revolved heavily around Scott, Cassie and Janet but the film as a whole was very family centric. I will say though that Jonathan Majors stole the spotlight as Kang. This film continues laying the foundation in regards to Kang and his variants that began in Loki. He was menacing and a legit threat that left me on the edge of my seat wondering what he was going to do next. Due to the film largely taking place in the quantum realm, it was very sci-fi influenced, reminiscent to that of Guardians of the Galaxy or Star Wars. I was a bit critical about the CGI and visuals as at times it wasn't the greatest but after watching Avatar the way of water my standards are pretty high. I rate the film a 7.5/10 overall."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Two thumbs up üëçüèªüëçüèª
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's was fun, but not awesome, it's a good movie to see when you got nothing better to do, but not theater level."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ignore the ""critics"" this movie rocks, was a fun story, good action it's not going to make the mcu top 5 but that's a very hard list to top.

This was a fun easy movie to watch my only problem with the movie is they should have kept the original cassie from endgame she was a better actor"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not quite as small in scope as what we are used to from the Ant-Man franchise but it still has the Ant-man heart and humor we've grown to love. An amazing cast and stellar special effects give it an extra kick. The standout villain, Kang leaves you curious as to what the future holds for the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This what a great movie way better than Thor love and thunder and can even level with doctor strange and the multiverse of madness. A few corny lines but the action was still great and the jokes were great. Modok was funny but he could have looked better. Kang is amazing.. by far one of the best villains of all time. Post credits where amazing.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really hoped and wanted it to be great, but it was lackluster for sure. The first Ant-Man is still the best. Marvel screenplays are definitely inconsistent."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the critics are sick of Marvel Movies so they just want to get on the ""comic book movies are getting old"" bandwagon.  Not sure what they were expecting here, If you like big budget popcorn movies this was it.  It was a pleasure to watch and I had fun.  I will see it again."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best of the trilogy. More serious and more action packed. A great beginning for the new phase 5 lead up to the big Avenger films later on.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The plot of the movie was amazing
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had a great time watching it in 3D, it was kind of nice getting away from the previous Ant-man formula and having them explore the quantum realm a bit more in depth."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,So much Hype for the film and was disappointed
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Knows exactly what it is and uses it to its greatest potential! A spectacular adventure and stunning visuals!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall, stellar visuals and interesting story. Kang is looking to be a worthy villain possibly on par with Thanos. The comedy is solid, MODOK is fun. My main complaint is the script, which seems rushed and like it needed more time in the percolator. At a mere two hours, it probably needed more time to stretch a few plotlines out and make them more believable. Still, I will watch it again and quite enjoyed it."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Don't believe the un-hype.  This was a good movie.  Not upper tier MCU (Infinity War, Endgame, Winter Soldier, Civil War), but it's definitely in the top half of their projects.  As I was watching it, I couldn't find where all the negativity came from with all these ""critics"".  It's much better than they're making it out to be,  Watch it.  Jonathan Majors is awesome."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to critics it was amazing fast paced ,lots of action , kang was amazing as well sets up phase 5 perfectly . All round just a really good movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,If you thought it wasn't going to get worse for marvel. Wait till you see this movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I will start by saying I've watched every marvel film since its inception, for over 10 years I've enjoyed the ride and loved watching my favourite comic book hero's and villains come to life on the big screen, and as the endgame credits rolled, I knew the MCU would never be the same again‚Ä¶ there was a time when marvel could do no wrong, everything they touched seemed to turn to gold‚Ä¶ apparently they have lost the recipe because this was yet another post infinity war/endgame mess‚Ä¶ quantumania is visually nice to look at, but I ultimately left thinking ""what did I pay to just watch""‚Ä¶ Paul Rudd was great as usual, Evangeline Lilly is just there with a new hair cut‚Ä¶ Katherine newton who played langs daughter got a tonne of screen time as did Michelle pfeiffer, but I got the same forced girl power vibe that endgame game us, I find Jonathan's character kang intriguing, but if you don't know about the character and his comic book roots, then your going to be left dumbfounded and questioning what's happening‚Ä¶ and then you remember this is all happening on a subatomic level which almost makes it carry no weight in terms of threat to the MCU we know because we see nothing of what could possibly come‚Ä¶ I mean he gets beaten by a swarm of intelligent ants soooooo‚Ä¶ Darren cross is back as modok but they turned him in to somewhat of a joke and he's very difficult to watch on screen‚Ä¶ and what was bill Murray even in this film for, his part could literally have been played by ANY old grey actor‚Ä¶ if this was your first marvel film, you could have opened your eyes at any point and just assumed you were watching a Star Wars film‚Ä¶ marvel have released 8 films since endgame, and one has been worth watching, thank you Spider-Man‚Ä¶ Towards the end of the movie, Kang speaks not just to Ant-Man, but to me personally, when he says, ""I just want you to remember that you could have gone home."""
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Movie was Beautiful, it's truly the beginning of Phase 5, Jonathan Majors is killing as Kang the Conqueror and His Variants, what I didn't like was the Modock CGI, but the rest including Scott and Cassie Relationship was Beautiful, I give it a 23/10 and a very inspir√¢nd recomandation to see it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than expected! KANG!!! I didn't even miss Louis. The background effects were stellar!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst Marvel movie I have ever seen in my life! (Besides the last Thor)
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's been a while since I've seen a marvel movie that was a bit more than the basic formula. And while you can say this more of the same, the introduction of kang is a great one as the MCU's next biggest threat.

The only thing for me that was really lacking was the laxk of script for the wasp character as it felt she was in the movie JUST to be in the movie.

Overall I enjoyed it"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, Majors stole EVERY scene he was in and the relationships shown between the 2 families (Cassie and Scott. Hope, Hank and Janet) were amazing.
Act 1 was a bit slow however once Kang was put on screen the movie was much better paced."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Johnathan Majors is Great! Kang feels like a real threat for the Avengers. The movie was fun and the visuals was also great!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A cheap movie like all marvel movies these years.
Bad CGI, not moving story"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was an amazing movie the editing and effects were fantastic and the story was very entertaining overall this movie is must watch and kept me on the edge of my seat (literally at one point) honestly you should give it a go! For a marvel movie it sits in the good spot not in the mediocre alright section or one of the best movies ever etc just good! Aswell as this nothing was too confusing all of it was pretty easy to understand and follow and even predict some moments! However others were unpredictable! It was in that sweet spot! The only gripe me and my friend had was that we did not quite understand the suit.

Edit: comedy was also lousy at best but that was probably just me because I heard quite a lot of people laughing at some of the movies jokes thinking back 1 or 2 of them did get me to laugh a bit not out loud tho just a smile however still not that great considering marvels reputation and budget!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie it was fun and entertaining with great performances all around
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"ME PARECE QUE ES UNA PELICULA QUE SI VAS A VER CON EXPECTATIVAS MUY ALTAS PUEDES SALIR DECEPCIONADO, PERO COMO UNA PELICULA INDIVIDUAL DE ANT MAN ME PARECE UNA BUENA PELICULA CON ALGUNOS ERRORES CRITICABLES PERO QUE EN TERMINOS GENERALES ES PASABLE Y PALOMERA"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"NON-SPOILER: Best setting for an MCU movie. Slimmed down cast allow for each character to carry weight and shine. Movie greatly explores both wacky and sci-fi elements. Gives MCU much needed direction that I can't wait to see more of. Best balance of drama and comedy since Infinty War. All killer, no filler!

SPOILER: After a lackluster directionless phase 4, Quantumania grabs and pulls you in immediately for a multiverse-shaking epic story. Scott Lang, after saving half of life in the universe just wants to enjoy the simpler parts of life and catch-up with missed time he loat with his daughter, Cassie. While Cassie and Scott's relationship isn't where they'd want it to be, they both try their best to make it work. The movie easily could have inserted artificial tension between the father and daughter but decides to lean into the strength of their past built relationship from Ant-man 1 and 2, as well as it being impossible for any one to hold a grudge against Scott Lang's infectious charm and positivity. While the movie shows that Cassie has taking extremely well to Quantum Science out of a desire to have saved her father, it does not feel forced. She still is an amateur at combat and has a lot to learn from the veterans in her family. Hope having just got her family back together spends entire movie diving headfirst to save the ones she loves not allowing anyone to separate them again. Hank leans more into his love of ants this time around with his colony of hyper-intelligent ants. Janette spends the film trying to avoids her past and the mistakes she made, but accepts that it her resp3to make sure Kang does not make out of the Quantum Realm. Kang is a fully-realized character that has such high self-belief and presence that you can't help but as a viewer to hang on each word and action he delivers. Whether through the stories of Janette, the Resistance, Krylar etc. Kang's threat is well established. Darren, I mean M.O.D.O.K, is a character that is impossible to make menacing and so the movie went for tragic and ironic and I think it works.

The Quantum Realm is the No. 1 place in the MCU I want to be explored more. In this movie we saw more diverse characters and concepts than in the entire MCU combined. Each one pleasant in their comedic or mind-being nature. The realm truly feels more lived in than Asgard, Kharma-taj, New York ever have.

My only minor gripe is the ending. It is obvious to anyone who has seen the film but their were changes made to the final scenes of the film. Scott and Hope should have remained in the quantum with it being a bittersweet victory of them defeating Kang and keeping their family safe bit at the cost of being trapped in the quantum realm for a while. I have full confidence that this isn't the last we've seen of this version of Kang and that he'll return even more fearsome than before.

Story: 8/10 Hits all the important oit of the park and leaves you wanting more
Pacing: 9/10 All killer, no filller
Comedy: 10/10 Every joke or comedic scene lands perfectly and never undermines the serious moments(Thor Lover and Thunder)
Action 9/10: Best Ant-man action in the MCU.
Set Pieces: 10/10 There are at least 7 major set pieces and they all are among the best in the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it, it's a very funny movie, the villain Kang was interesting and imposing, it was a great adventure, the quantum realm is beautiful and some creatures in it have very creative designs, and we had more mentions of what's to come in the next avengers movies, Scott and the other characters are still good as they always were, this was a good start for phase 5, I am surprised"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film was great, don't pay attention to the critics."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie. The biggest problem I had was after seeing Avatar way of the water, the special effects in this movie were just meh. The story was good the actors did a great job so I‚Äôd recommend seeing it. Kang is one cool villain."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie cant wait for next movie in marvel
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"My wife and I loved this movie and don't understand why it's getting all the hate it is. We watched it Thursday night (opening night) and we loved it! The only things we could even think of wanting different was we wanted a little more action and I thought the movie could have been a little longer. We loved that not only was there still funny parts throughout the movie like in the rest of the ant man movies, but we also loved the feeling of dread and the unknown this movie was putting out, just knowing how big of a bad guy Kang is in the comics and the MCU and seeing him go up against Ant Man. Overall I think I'd give it and 8.5 or 9 out of 10 and I think we'll definitely be doing this again soon!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A lot of marvel hate lately. The critics got it wrong, great start to  phase 5. Throughly enjoyable, far better than Thor 4 or black panther 2. 

Go watch, visual spectacle."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie and a return to form. The critics don't know what they're on about. As you can see from the high audience rating. 

It's a visual feast and the writing in the movie was great! Especially the towards the end with Modok. 
It was exciting and I also loved the world building in the quantum realm. 
Johnathan Majors was good as Kang, but not sure about some of his iterations in the post credit scenes. 
Paul Rudd is a fantastic actor. Brings the right amount of comedy to scenes, but also is great at the emotional ones too. 

Honestly, ignore the critics and go and make your own judgement. After all, their opinion is only an opinion."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rotten Tomatoes did this movie well. I had low expectations and had read about it being a Sci Fi movie. Looking at it that way, I really enjoyed this film. I can see the argument against it but I thought Kang was great, Paul Rudd and the Ant Family were great as a team This was truly an Ant Man and The Wasp Movie (former and present versions). See it yourself! Look at the audience score"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sloppy mid credit scene, and has sever pacing issues."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors is perfect
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"My family and I really enjoyed Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania definitely not boring and great world building, The Action is mind blowing, Kang is a great villain and can't wait to see more of him."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Just watched this and thought it was pretty awesome. Jonathan Major as Kang the conqueror was amazing. Paul Rudd and company did a good job but it felt like Hope and her parents were just a afterthought to the movie. The story was weak as many Marvel movies are it did more to help build the greater MCU. But over all I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to any Marvel Fan or casual sci-fi/ action fan.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The humor isn't written as well as other Ant Man productions or scenes, so don't expect to laugh as much. Overall, it's a good stand alone adventure while continuing to set up major themes for the MCU!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan majors as the kang did great of the actor
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was an action packed emotional ride and I look forward to more entries in the franchise!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Marvel has been decreasing in entertaining fans in their most recent releases. This has a lot of those moments but the movie did entertain me as a comic fan.

Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors scenes together were amazing to me. Jonathan Majors did an outstanding job as Kang.

I do have to say that the movie felt like I was watching an episode of Rick and Morty if Rick and Morty was produced by Disney.

I do recommend seeing this film but you can wait until it streams unfortunately."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"honestly very forgettable, mess of a story and just disappointed."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie   Janet and Kang are amazing characters in this movie   More deeper explanation of kang wouldve been nice but all of the other action and sequences made up with interesting information adding to the movie of the other characters
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"While the movie can have pacing issues and doesn't spend much time with it's main cast, it's clear that it has a focus and a good core theme of standing up for oppressed people and an antagonist worth seeing"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good story, great action and just enough humor without being too funny"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie did a pretty good job kicking off the MCU Phase 5. Ant man movies have always felt difficult to do perfectly because Paul Rudd's wheel house is comedy rather than action-centric acting. I think it also does a pretty good job of setting up what Kang can do without using up all of his backstory and strengths in the first movie of a (at least) two phase story. Overall, if you're a marvel fan, I'd say it's worth seeing in theaters."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp - Quantumania is a good movie. It can't keep up with the highlights of the MCU, but it is an exciting and entertaining superhero movie from Marvel Studios. The action is very good, long takes and few cuts. Everything is set up very well. The CGI is okay, but some scenes and characters (Modok) look terribly animated. The cast is unfortunately very shaky. Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet and especially Jonathan Majors as Kang rock their roles and are absolute scene-stealers. The two characters are not only the most interesting characters in the film, but also carry the main plot on their shoulders. Paul Rudd is again absolutely great as Scott Lang and Kathryn Newton also fits very well as Cassie, but is completely lost next to the other characters. Michael Douglas as Hank Pym has next to nothing to do and Evangeline Lilly as Wasp is also just there. Due to the setting in the Quantum Realm, the atmosphere of the film is completely different from its two predecessors. The film runs riot and takes full advantage of what the Quantum Realm has to offer, which is great. The tone is also darker than the last two Ant-Man movies, reminiscent of a mix between Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor - Ragnarok. The humor is a bit much in places, but fine. The film also connects the MCU more again and builds up the future. Everything seems more cohesive now. It builds hype for what is to come."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,One of the better marvel films of recent still fees underwhelming however with comedy and character development especially with the wasp however Kang looks like a very good villain
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The best of the trilogy. Loved every minute.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was fun, jumped into it & not 3 hours long!!! Makes recent Star Wars jealous with the ""entourage"" of creatures , outdone Avatar 2 in the 3D department, a nod to Dune! Did I say fun? Bill Murray? There are 2 low-key ) characters in the second after credits scene!! By time it played I was last man standing!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Majors did a great job with what he was given. I wish we would‚Äôve gotten more background scenes or flashbacks to show how menacing he truly is. But I do understand they have many more movies to further explore his character.  Wasn‚Äôt as emotionally moving as the trailer suggests but I still overall enjoyed the movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it there were allot of new fun characters. Allot of humor.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think it was a good start to this phase 5 of the MCU, it's an entertaining and intriguing film"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Little boring , too much effects but not good story, forced jokes."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyed it. Would put it at a solid 7/10 . While it may prove confusing to the average casual Marvel fan, if you are a bit more involved in the MCU, it is a good intro to Phase 5. As it sets up the future. I liked how it felt more sci-fi than fantasy. If you haven't seen it yet, be aware of the 2 post credit scenes. 
Homework- Ant man , Ant man & The Wasp, Infinity War, Endgame, and the Loki series.
These will get the casual viewer up to speed. Might want to look up MODOK too. 
This film begs to be seen in IMAX. For the full experience. Totally worth it!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Over half the movie was setting up the movie..
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not as bad as bad as critics think imo.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a SOLID start to MCU‚Äôs Phase 5. Well done!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Trust in Marvel/Disney restored!!!!!
Thank you so much for changing your plans ... no more phase 4 please!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not a masterpiece but fun to watch none the less.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,It wasn't funny nor any comedy
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great start to Phase 5. It's very wacky at times, and the CGI leaves a lot to be desired. Similar to the CGI of Wakanda Forever. Kind of lackluster. Especially after James Cameron set the bar so high already within the Disney umbrella. I'll blame it on staffing and deadlines. 

This movie would have served a lot better from the viewpoint of Kang, with Scott and the gang acting as a secondary role/plot. Majors fleshed out a lot of personality into Kang, and I would've loved to get more into his motives and drive. 

When Majors is off screen is when the weakness of the movie really shine through. There are some scenes where the green screen cuts into the characters hair, taking me out of focus. Some cheesy lines could've been left out to make way for more physical acting, which this movie greatly lacked. 

All in all, it's a fun weekend getaway, with the only memorable character being the one who will be most important over the next 5 years of the MCU and that's Jonathan Majors', Kang the Conqueror."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Okay with a passion this movie is awesome to me but the mcu is still shit
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man & The Wasp Quantumania is a pure comic book adventure movie. Weird and wonderful with all the things you love about reading comics with the Quantum Realm and its denizens on full display. Paul Rudd brings his charm and fighting skills and he and Kathryn Newton have some great family chemistry as father and daughter. My only issue is I wish Scott and Cassie had a little bit more story since he wishes they had more time together, but given that the movie is only just barely over two hours long, I get why they had to get the main story moving. Jonathan Majors' Kang is scary as hell and poised to bring havoc to the MCU. There's also two end credit scenes, so don't leave before the very end! Forget the critics, go see it!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie is as generic as it gets. Being there, done that. 

No plot twists, no stakes. The big bad guy is not as menacing as Thanos.

The movie would have been better if Scott Lang had just got murdered by Kang and him winning in this movie. 

That could have set up an arc of revenge for Scott's daughter, that would make sense considering she never has had much time with her dad and now that she could finally get some of that time, she realizes she will never have that due to this monster which would make her grow and take on the mantle of the antman to ""avenge"" the death of her dad. But instead she is already an avenger, she already has the suit, and can already beat bad guys.

It would also have established Kang as a bigger threat than Thanos where could have just fone from movie to movie murdering some of the avengers permanently, starting with Scott.

She also is one of the smartest kids in the planet somehow like every other teen girl in the mcu. I get that MCU wants girls to have role models, but this is ridiculous at this point. Every teen girl is a mega genius that builds quantum tunnels in her basement, special herbs that give you unnatural superpowers, robot that fly liek iron man and that even the military has not been able to replicate despite having trillions of dollars to come up with their own version.

The actress playing her is also bat at acting, she spends the entire movie with a face of contained laughter, regardless of what actual emotion that the scene would require. When she is suppsoed to be dissapointed at her dad, her face feels like she is laughing, when she is suppsoed to be sad, she is still with the face of contained laughter. It's like the Brie Larson, but the oppsoite. Brie Larson is always with a deadpan face regardless of the scene, never shows any emotion at all. While Scott's daughter is always laughing regardless of the situation.

The humor again ruins this movies. it's like they saw that Guardians of the galaxy and deadpool were successfull and thought, hey we need to make every movie have goofy humour showhorned in and make everything a joke. 

Do they not realize that the best MCU movies are actually the ones that have less humor, like Winter Solider, Civil War, Infinity War, No way home,... sure those movies have a joke here and there, but compared to thor 4, or ant man 3, those movies are super serious and dramatic and allow you to feel and take whats happening seriously.

In antman they are fighting, and suddenly they stop so Scott can teach his daughter how to punch, right there in the middle of the battle. That kind of thing takes away any tension the scene might have had, because if they can do that then clearly they are in control and not in any real danger, so if they are not in danger why should people care about what happens? 

The movie feels sometimes liek Starwars, but honestly you never really care about what happens. Kang is just eveil because he is a conqueror, and conquerors are bad because they conquer and build new worlds so that they keep continuing to conquer worlds. His motivation makes no sense, unlike Thanos's motivation. THis guy just likes to destroy worlds because the plot demands a big bad guy destroying worlds.

It's not as bad probably as the critics would say, but its not as good as what the audience seems to be giving it in this page. I'd say 5 or 6 /10 being generous, but defeinetley a big dissapointment. The mcu needs less humor, and higher stakes. And hugher stakes doesnt mean that the world has to end, it means permanent consequences to the lvoed ones of the hero for example or to the hero himself. 

By that i mean that either AntMan should have died, or his daighter and his girlfriend should have died or all of them, since noone cares abotu ant man anyway. He is always being the lamest Avenger"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Same with Thor, you have to expect this kind of humor, the world down there looks awesome and I'm happy Kang finally arrived, also loved the 2 post credits scenes, speaking bout story, yeah it's ok! You need to watch it anyway, if you want to see where it started with Kang."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,If you love marvel you will love this movie. Great introduction to phase 5 and gets you prepared for what's to come. Kang will need some back surgery after carrying this movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie I liked a lot. Kang stall the show in the second half of the movie. Paul Rudd and his Co-stars performance shine thought out the movie. The only thing that would make it better. More Kang showing off his powers.

The post credit scenes were good. Especially the first one."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was good, I feel like it is just the beginning and it is just the right way to start off a new chapter."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jonathan's Majors role as Kang, saves the movie from being a complete failure. The film tries to overcome a predictable storyline, with over the top CGI. Audience will either be off put by all the weird characters, or moderately amused. If your expectations aren't sky high, there are worse films to pass 2 hours, but I suspect no one will walk out and be blown away."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie! I can't wait to see what happens next.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, It was so exciting"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are wrong on this one 
The movie is amazing 
Go see it"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow what a great movie!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not bad this is the start of future.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie! Funny, entertaining, great introduction to The Conqueror, & keeps the Marvel Universe story rolling. Quantum Realm gives off Star Wars vibes. I liked it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing start for the new phase
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Almost missed it at the theatre b/c of the reviews.  This is a solid Marvel movie with all the things you'd come to expect.  Easily better than Eternals or Wakanda, and misses all the stuff everyone complains about.   Kang carries the movie and I'm looking forward to seeing Marvel characters battle him across time and the multiverse."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,It not good but not bad
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"this movie was great. Huge in scale. I had seen bad critic reviews and was worried they had missed the mark. having seen myself, it delivered. I think critics aren't really comic movie fans and some superhero movie fatigue has set in . I'm not sure what they're looking for but this movie was a fantastic introduction to the next phase. I'll deduct one star because the multiplicity of Kang at the end was kinda silly. took some of the seriousness from his threat but otherwise, awesome job."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't understand where the hate reviews came from I love it the only thing I didn't like was the new actress playing Cassie but everyone else clocked in! Very enjoyable an I even rested up at janes monologue to hope loved it a the post credit scenes were even more on point
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pros: Michelle Pfeiffer and Johnathan Majors rule. Scott and Cassie are lovable. Great villains. Decent humor (I'll discuss more in cons), entertaining.

Cons: some of the humor was a miss. It felt like maybe the comedic timing was off at times. This movie is cgi heavy. I personally don't mind it, but some of the cgi needed some work. There were too many characters that felt hollow. It felt like they need more scenes to make you care about them. These are my main gripes. 

Overall, I enjoyed the movie! Go watch!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was a foreshadow of more great marvel movies to come. It had everything! It was suspenseful, it had comedy and action. I would definitely recommend it to all my friends and family."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If your see this film just for the sake of seeing a superhero film than this will be a fun ride. However storyline wise the plot is muddled and uneven, too much emphasis on the humour doesn't mix well some more serious moments. Visually stunning and the cast performances was great, still the film felt a bit bloated."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really fun, amazing visuals, quantum realm and its inhabitants were imaginative and well done. Don't know what the critics are talking about. Loved it!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing, this movie does the MCU justice, the acting was amazing, and the plot just leaves you wondering what else the MCU has in store!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good movie! Not nearly as bad as the critics make it out to be. Sure, there are some dull points and underused characters, but this is definitely a great movie and a great start to phase 5.

Next Up: Guardians Of The Galaxy Volume 3"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I do not understand the film critics a marvel movie is supposed to be fun which this certainly is also if they are looking for serious or dramatic watch a drama or a horror movie not a comic book movie and stop giving people a negative view all the time if people got any sense just have a look at the audience score not the film critics
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a decent showing for the MCU but if you havent seen the previous Ant Man films or the Loki series on Disney+ then you will be confused by this movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"For 50+ years, DC Comics SUPERMAN was faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. When the printed page, still referred to as comic books, was the criteria used to establish America's definitions of what a superhero's requirements were - that was enough. Enter Marvel Comics and their Cinematic Universe and the world of superhero's literally exploded onto the big screens across the global universe. CGI - Computer Generated Imagery - allowed the expansion of a writer's dream to unlimited visual depiction of limitless actions, characters and superhero adventures. Guardians, Avengers, Spider Men, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America and ultimately an Ant-Man were brought to the big screens to deliver shock and awe to the millions of fans waiting to share their next grand adventures. Enter Ant - Man Paul Rudd and his WASP partner Evangeline Lilly who are joined by Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Jonathan Majors and Bill Murray's entrance and exploration of the QUANTUM REALM. Consider that ""if"" you were a talented sci-fi writer with techno knowledge and a painter's skills that would allow you to create whatever your mind might envision on a big screen for all to share. This is the perfect description of how the QUANTUM World became Ant-mans reality. This is simply an how to escape from a bad place and an evil adversary trying to destroy everything and everyone in the universe. If you enjoy the creative genius of technically creative artists then you may enjoy this movie. It is loud, colorful and creative. What more might you anticipate or expect from someone called ANT-Man?
Rating: S - M - B- M = Superman May Be Missed"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Certainly not the worst Marvel movie out there, but feels more like a bridge to the Future than its own feature. Entertaining and pretty to look at, but not much substance."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"was disappointed by the last marvel movies, but this one was quite good and a fun watch!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved it. Haters gonna hate, I guess."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was amazing. The quantum realm is gorgeous. The movie was really good. Stay for the 2 post credit scenes
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very unbalanced and hard to rate. There are parts that really fell flat especially in the first act, but the second act I found very good. Most of the jokes landed in the packed theater I was in. Khan was by far the best thing about the movie however. Overall, the second act and some scenes at the end keep this movie out of trouble and it was enjoyable but with little rewatchability."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun popcorn movie! thrills and spills. Thankfully not ruined by the trailer, the fun stuff is in the film!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a great movie must watch
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No meaningful character development or characterization beyond Kang. Half-baked Star Wars-lite. Peyton Reed is not the director for large blockbusters. Otherwise, there is fun and a handful of laughs to be had, plus reliable performances make it watchable. But at the end of the day, the film remains hollow."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a very bizarre and strange movie. Spends most of the time outside of reality. It reminds me of how Wizard of Oz felt to me when I watched it as a child or Narnia but both of those seem quaint compared to this. I enjoyed the dialogue and lack of action scenes as I prefer it although those wanting super heroes fighting a monster while bashing over skyscrapers may be disappointed. It reminds me a little like a Rick and Morty in that it throws intellectual concepts at you quickly and frequently and just expects you to keep up or not care. It also reminds me that it has lots of silly and weird concepts.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this movie was amazing! Don't listen to the critics. See for yourself. It was definitely worth the watch and pulls you in from the start to finish with no filler.It was one of my favorite! Will go see again!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It reminded me of the good old Marvel movies where they forshadow something bigger coming up.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Right up there with guardians 2 and thor ragnarok.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not enough Kang. Super corny and lame plot.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie puts the MCU back on the map. A great start for MCU Phase 5. Honestly can't get enough of Kang. Jonathan Majors will carry the MCU into a new age of greatness
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely phenomenal. I personally think it's the best in the trilogy.  Some of the cgi could have been polished up more, but everything else was amazing. Jonathan majors is an intimidating force to be reckoned with. He plays Kang perfectly. Can't wait for Loki season 2 and The Avengers Kang Dynasty."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This obviously wasn't a normal Ant-Man film like previous installations. This one introduced Kang and what's in store for the future. I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. This is exactly why I never listen to critics. Everyone has to see for themselves and give their own opinions. I thought it was a stellar movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good science fiction proposal set in the MCU and with a very prominent villain! I was prepared for the worst by the criticisms in the press, but each time those criticisms seem doubtful and tendentious. Pure entertainment when Scott Lang is around. Kang is very intimidating and I am very interested to see his progression. It is a film that made me spend very good moments in the cinema. The movie isn't the best in the MCU but, I see an improvement in this modest Ant-Man sub-franchise."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Confusing unless youve watch all of the other movies.  Too long.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not even remotely as bad as Thor: Love and Thunder and Wakanda Forever, but still not a particularly good movie. And I say this as someone who loved the first two Ant-man movies. Most of the humour simply fell flat, and overall the movie was slow and boring. The w oak nonsense Disney's famous for was kept to a minimum, but it still wasn't enough to save this movie. If this is the movie Disney chose to launch phase 5 of the M She U and bring back the Marvel fans Disney's all but abandoned in recent years they're in a lot of trouble."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I went in expecting to be disappointed since I heard about all the early reviews but I didn't think it was bad at all.  It was a fun movie and I enjoyed the Quantum Realm.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great VFX otherwise quite mediocre
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible Kang, good main characters and bad CGI MODOK. There is not much more to say, thanks for starting to understand where the second MCU saga is going."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Spoiler: There are defenitly big issues with the storyline in the beginning, plotholes just not well done, but in the second half, i got allot of Rick & Morty Vibes and i loved it. Expecially Hanks Apperiance in the End. And dont forget, its an ""Antman-Movie"". They where all simple Heist movies and felt like MCU Spinoffs. You can not expect to get all ur questions answered and the big dramatic Introduction in a triology that is used to be dumb. We got a next very nice taste of a Kang, but i think he sees that scott wouldnt understand his ambitions; he maybe still believes in 'Back to the Future Timetravel Logic'. So why should he explain it just for the Viewer? Deadpool is comming, its already his thing. Ah f*** Shehulk, lets forget about that.
So basicly just give them Time and im sure, the Kang Saga wont be dissapointing.
But in this movie, u know from the first Moment Antman cant fight Kang, so the Movie has to End in a dodgy way, but as i mentioned, Hank vs Kang is just the perfect level of stupidity+randomness for me. Sry for my emglisch. Ants = R&M Snakes."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Although the tone is different from other Ant-Man movies, it is an enjoyable movie. The world building is decent, Jonathan Majors as Kang is amazing, and overall this film  delivers. There are a few paling issues but all in all it is worth a (re)watch!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Really Loved it! I Love where they are going in this Marvel phase!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm reading all the rotten reviews from critics and I've never felt more disconnected. It's like we watched different movies. What did they want?
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome! I dont know why the crictics said it was bad!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang is well acted by Majors. The VFX and story fell flat.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"After seeing the reviews from the critics, I didn't have high expectations for this film. Dunno what the critics were watching but we thoroughly enjoyed it. Heart, humour, great action and setting up future Marvel TV & Films. Go see!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jonathon Majors performance in this movie was outstanding. The overall script was not that great. The plot was basically a secret kept, a secret comes out, and chaos ensues. The visuals were marvelous to see on the screen, however, they did feel like a rip off of Star Wars both in the portrayals of the cities, costumes, and characters. It was not a bad movie nor was it a great movie. It was just a good movie. I hope that the MCU phase 5 can do better than phase 4."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was alright, wasn't too thrilled with the storyline. Found myself disengaged from what was even going on at times. Could anticipate every next scene or moment that would or could happen in the movie.
Will give a two thumbs up on the puns and comedy aspect of this movie. Although laughs are needed in it, I felt it was the only thing keeping this movie together for a ""Marvel Cinematic"". 
You could wait till this movie is streaming or rentable. Feel free to watch it, but not worth a crowded environment or even the ticket price. I got a great deal, which is why I went."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Interesting characters in the quantum realm. Good to see Ant-Man finally up against a major character.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Better than Thor love and Thunder but that's not saying much. The only redeeming factor was Jonathan Majors, he was brilliant as Kang. But in the end even he was overshadowed by bad direction and writing. Visually pretty poor as well üò™"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fabulous first entry to Phase 5. Jonathan Major is a sight to behold and Paul Rudd is as charming as ever. Loved loved loved!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute blast and amazing world building for the MCU! Cannot wait for what‚Äôs to come!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,loved it screw them haters and trolls
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Honestly it is meh. Credits are the best part. Plot is so convenient and you never feel anyone is ever in any danger.  CGI at points in the beginning is not the best in certain scenes. I wish it was amazing but it just isn‚Äôt.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's one of the best Marvel movies. It's in my top 5. Don't listen to critics. It's very good
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am absolutely loved this movie! Best marvel movie in a while for me and left the theatre with a smile and buzz. 
Jonathan Majors as Kang is incredible but Paul Rudd is equally as captivating and charming.
New characters were excellent, the pace of the movie was great.
All round; a wonderful time at the pics and great start to phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is fantastic the villain Kang the conqueror is written well and the fact that it shows that Kang was so powerful that it took them 2 avengers and a new avenger plus OG shield agents and super giant intelligent ants and the whole quantum realm army just to defeat him it tells that he's bad news and that he should be feared and the worst is yet to come yeah we didn't get the comedy and laughter like Ant-Man 1&2 but that kinda indicates that phase 5 will be kinda darker and whatnot and it shows how far Scott Lang will go for his daughter like any father would and that actually touched me but if people watched the movie with an absolute positivity this movie is an amazing work of excellence overall it was an amazing movie and it was worth it
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Plot is too simple.  Characters not well developed.  Background looks fake throughout the movie.  

Overall, boring and I fell asleep."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't understand what is wrong with the critics this movie is exactly what  it was presented as a fun adventure in the Quantum realm with the ant family nothing more nothing less. Just because a movie isn't what you theorized it was going to be doesn't make it bad.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved Ant-Man 3! It was an epic and fun loving sci-fi adventure. Kang has arrived!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"About 3/4 of the way through I found myself asking why I was watching it. What were the stakes? Won't mention exactly why to avoid spoilers. The visuals were pretty, Paul Rudd is enjoyable and makes Scott compelling, but beyond that it feels fairly milquetoast. Not a threatening introduction for Kang and missing the things that made Ant Man 1&2 stand out."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was pretty good, solid 7.5 put of ten for me. I can see why some people might not like it, the story isn't as properly consistent, a few of the jokes don't feel that earned, ect. But if you want another chapter in the Multiverse Saga that lays a proper foundation for proper stakes and see Johnathan Majors be the MVP among actors in the MCU post Endgame? Watch this movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing!! The action & tension was so strong! Definitely will be watching again.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Paul Rudd is amazing and the action is really good and inventive. Overall the Quantum Realm is a little weird and feels more like something from the Guardians/Marvel Cosmic than something new. Kang is a great villain and he is set up really well here. Some of the plot beats are a little weird and don't make sense and one character is just really weird and took me out of the movie (no spoilers here). Overall it was a fun ride and I do look forward to seeing these characters more in the future.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,BEST MCU FILM. great start to phase 5. KANG is everything. Forget the critics! Trippy and deeper than we think. TIME IS NOT A STRAIGHT LINE
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,The Casie actress was awful no facial expressions just bland.  Hope didn‚Äôt kick as much ass as movie 2   Kinda did not give you anything to the story
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel is definitely setting up the stakes for the future, good comedy mixed with action."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was funny and action packed and just great all together and weird but in a good way. Ant-Man is a cool Superhero. Don't listen to the critics ok go see this movie it's a great movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't let the critics fool you. If you liked the other Ant-man movies, you should enjoy this one. Pfeiffer and Majors really shine in this, and it is a great intro to Kang as the next big bad. CGI was pretty good throughout, and definitely excited for what comes next with these characters."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's actually a pretty entertaining Marvel movie despite some reviews. Not as funny and without the charming ""small scale"" than the first two Ant-man (but actually better than the second one.) This one is big and feels like more like a Guardian of Galaxy movie. It takes place in a whole new universes with ""alien"" characters, spaceships, lot of lasers, explosion and some ridiculous characters along the way to bring the laugh. More than a space adventure, the quantum universe allows even more creativity with scenes with memorable visuals (one scene in particular looks like it was taken from a Doctor Strange movie).

Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer all shine in this movie for different reason. Kang in particular is terrifying which is promising for the next MCU phase. The rest of the cast though... the story don't go in their favor, Hope doesn't have much to do this time and Cassy is stuck in the too common daughter-father trope and the actress herself don't sell it well enough to let the viewers pass through that.

The story is not very strong (too gentle in my opinion) and the CGI can be a little wacky, the green screen can be very apparent in the earliest scene in the Quantum universe, but the movie is entertaining up to the very last post-credit scene."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's not top 10 Marvel but not bottom 10 either.   It's fun and exciting lots of Michelle she takes over a chuck of the movie and it's great. Majors is great. People comparing it to End Game are ridiculous it doesn't have that impact and to think it would is silly. Some complain it's in the Quantum realm too much - it's called Quantumania for crying out loud. I'd say it's on par with Dr Strange 2 not great but a fun good time
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"To begin with, the film is neither very good nor very bad, it is average, it is a kind of generic film, but it still entertains, it has good special effects, an ok soundtrack, the villain of this film is certainly the best thing about this film, Jonathan Majors is spectacular as Kang and the two post-credits scenes are AWESOME."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great introduction to Kang, pacing is a little fast at the beginning and the overall plot is fairly simple but this is a good kickoff to phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A brilliant movie that was unlike the other two in the series of ant man movies but still keeps the fun. Jonathan Majors played an amazing part in the movie with his role of Kang. The only problem with the movie was that some of the jokes felt forced and not natural like in the other two movies but other than that great movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania was an absolute blast from start to finish.  The critic reviews had me scared but went in with an open mind and happy I did. Easily one of my favorite MCU projects post Endgame and even one of my fav MCU projects made. Kang, Janet, and Scott were the stand outs! Also, stay for both credits scenes!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed the movie stars were the older Antman and Wasp (Hank Pym and Janet). Paul Rudd on form as usual. Wasn't keen on Stature and they could have done a better job with Kang. Still enjoyed his plot. MODOK, useless!!! The mind reader guy could have been used better."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,No sense of urgency. A whole lot of down time
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Hardcore MCU fan here. This was the most enjoyable theatrical experience since Endgame. The movie wastes no time in getting right into the plot and action. Definitely laying the groundwork for something even bigger. Great characters great cgi. All of the jokes actually land for the first time in a while.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the most comic-book-feeling MCU movies so far. And better than almost everything in phase 4.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a fun Antman and the Wasp movie! Just don't expect the Avengers level fun, even from what Peyton Reed said, because it's not. 
We watched this movie with less expectations and my wife and I really enjoyed it! Will be back next weekend with my friends.
Also, don't let other youtube theories ruin your movie experience. Less expectations and have fun.
BEST MOVIE in the Antman trilogy. 
Way better than Black Adam IMHO.üòÖ
Miss Michael Pe√±a tho.‚òπÔ∏è
8.5/10üëçüèΩ"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Really just sucked overall..
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"*Spoilers*

Bad writing, the movie itself includes things and dialogues that don't backup what actually happens in the film. Kang ends up being not really a threat even when is said he was one of the most vicious variants who has killed many Avengers, yet gets owned by Antman and the Wasp,  M.O.D.D.O.K.'s inclusion feels so forced and a waste in the film they should have used that time to develop other characters and the other CGI, there are no stakes, the characters are one dimensional (Except maybe Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet and Michael Douglas' Hank, but they're not the main roles), the ending is rushed generic (even for MCU standard) and nothing pays off.  I have give MCU many free passes but this one felt an insult to the viewer, very ""They'll like anything we throw at them"", unfortunately."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was it the best MCU movie released? No, but it was much better than what some critics and talking heads on YouTube made it out to be. Some corny parts, some funny parts, and some decent action scenes. In other words, make your own conclusion and not let these ""experts"" dictate 
Your overall experience."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I simply ignored the reviews and saw it , though few lags here and there , i personally loved it & it's the best ant man movie among the three parts of ant man and visuals were also super cool ‚ù§Ô∏è Loved the movie a lot especially Kang and modok along with post credit scenes were so mind blowing"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Better than anything in Phase 4, with the exception of Spider-Man: No Way Home. Reminded me of the comic Black Science with the surreal setting and strange alien creatures. Finally gives some depth to Kang and the direction of the next few phases. At the end of the day it wasn't great but good enough."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall a good movie, Modok was a bit odd and his character arc was questionable but outside of that it was a good addition to the MCU and sets up an exciting phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie,kang was AMAZING great action,great cgi, had a great time with the movie don't give a damn about the reviews just go to the theater and let the movie take you to the quantum realm and watch the 2 BIG after credits scenes"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't understand the critics because it's a really good movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very entertaining movie that doesn't invent the wheel and doesn't try to, with touches of Flash Gordon and Star Wars, but also of Rick and Morty. Incredible designs and concepts of machinery and creatures that handles. The Ant-Family shines and Kang is a villain for the future."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good, I have been waiting on Kang since Loki..best movie in phase 4 so far"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Professional critics are useless these days. I loved the movie. I have no complaints. I'm not sure what the agenda is with critics trying to tank this movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love it,best comic book adaptation,Jonathan majors is best villain in mcu without a doubt."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!  Spiritually deep!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was awesome, if you liked any of the other Antman movies you will enjoy this ride."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fun and definitely worth the watch. I love watching these big budget movies in the theater especially in the premium ones.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"So I went to go watch the movie tonight in 4DX (Would recommend IMAX rather) I might be in the minority, but I actually liked it, I found it to be better than most of Phase 4 movies. I feel it was better than Thor, Wakanda Forever and Doctor Strange. I took it for what it was an entertaining movie that sets up phase 5 and the Kang variants. 

Noticing critics being maybe a bit too harsh an unfair towards an above average to good movie.

Avoid the reviews and watch the movie for yourself and make your own opinion, Is the movie perfect, no, it has its flaws, but I enjoyed and would recommend others to go watch it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Epic movie. I don‚Äôt get the hate at all. Majors was amazing. Rudd was amazing. I everyone said it didn‚Äôt feel like an Antman movie but the movies have always been about the Pym and Lang families. It‚Äôs all of them that make Antman. And the two post credit scenes‚Ä¶.nerdgasm. 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Except for Katherine Newton‚Äôs acting. Everything else is good. The world building, the references to the multiversal war, the Kang Variants."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Talvez aqueles que esperam algo gigantesco e surpreendente ir√£o se decepcionar com o filme, por√©m para quem manteve suas expectativas contidas ir√° sair da sess√£o at√© satisfeito com o resultado.
Quantumania nada mais √© que um filme que apresenta o principal vil√£o da nova era da Marvel, assim como Homem-Formiga 2, que nada mais foi que um filme para se apresentar o Reino Qu√¢ntico, artif√≠cio usado em Ultimato, ou seja, o filme n√£o surpreende, ele apenas diverte assim como seus antecessores.
O filme √© divertido, e como uma boa terceira sequ√™ncia, √© repleto de a√ß√£o e bem din√¢mico (tendo pouco menos de 2 horas), aqui vemos pouco menos de Scott Lang, e sua equipe (Vespa, Hank, Janet e sua filha Cassie) ganham mais espa√ßo.
√â divertido a intera√ß√£o dos personagens com os seres do Reino Qu√¢ntico, que por sinal √© bem constru√≠do e muito interessante.
Kang est√° √≥timo. √â bem apresentado e est√° muito bem representado com uma atua√ß√£o arrepiante de Jhonatan Marjors. Embora as vezes tenham comportamentos de vil√£o classe B, Kang ainda sim nos mant√©m ansiosos com o futuro do personagem.
Acredito que Quantumania peca na apresenta√ß√£o rasa de personagens, efeitos toscos e nos escapismos f√°ceis de roteiros que vive a acompanhar a Marvel Studios desde sempre. Mas no geral, √© um filme que encerra a trilogia de Scott Lang de uma forma boa, e nos deixam ansiosos para o futuro do MCU/UCM"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best, marvel movie we had in a while didn't expect it to be this good and the post credit scenes just blow you away. Certified fresh"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Some of these critics are far too serious. It was a good movie. It would have been better sticking to what made the first two movies great (trying not to give out any spoilers), but it did set up phase 5 nicely. The only really annoying part for me was Cassie. That‚Äôs nitpicking though. Go see it."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie. Balanced mix of humor with good writing and acting, spectacular visuals and a compelling villain in Jonathan Major's Kang. I enjoyed the hell out of it."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Weird start not a lot of background for this 3rd movie or where it's going
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was better than the critics make it out to be. It was fun and entertaining. Kang will be great to see in this new phase. J Majors did a great job! He stole the show in my opinion.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Best of the antman movies, but is flawed because of the new MCU protocols when it comes to time saving on CGI, it had the potential to be spectacular, but Kangs suit looks black, and you can't even see the red in antmans suit. Well worth a watch, but don't expect the special effects to be up to the usual MCU standards"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it don‚Äôt listen to the ‚Äúcritics‚Äù they‚Äôre just hating because the title ‚Äúmarvel‚Äù is attached to it
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Antman Quantumania is probably the best installment in the MCU since Spider-Man No Way Home. Kang is relatable and layered and while he is clearly evil the mystery and danger of the other variants create doubt as to whether he is truly all wrong when it comes to his motivations. 7.5/10 Worth a Watch!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Love every minute of it
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was most definitely the best antman movie yet. And I think this is another solid entry for marvel. Lots of emotion and lots of humor and their balanced very well. Id advise checking this movie out its a very fun film.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel meet Jon Favreau ¬´¬†Star Wars World¬†¬ª
New, different & fresh !!
Finaly someting new in Kevin's world‚Ä¶
And‚Ä¶ Paul Rudd, forever & ever !
And Michele Pfeiffer glamour ¬´¬†whatever it takes¬†¬ª"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was all cool looking, very CGI, and comic looking as you would expect. There were some laughs, some stakes, and some good fights, and each major character had a moment where they were useful. Some were underused, but all had their moments. The plot made sense even though it seems to move really fast sometimes, this is not a bad thing. This was solid."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant man and company get pulled into the quantum zone where they face off against Many the Conqueror. Lots a of laughs, action and drama to keep you entertained from start to finish."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"fun, very good to be entertained with your family, don't expect something totally revolutionary, watch it without expectations and see the magic happen."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie üíñ
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another conditioning of false beliefs.
Not even entertaining!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sadly it's a big miss.  
The Cgi is acceptable at best in certain parts, the jokes are cheesy and feel forced.   The acting was the only good part of the movie.  

I feel like Disney, the MCU has lost its way, and they are trying to course correct, but it may just be too much and too far gone.  
It's a shame."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie lacked the heart of the first two Antman movies. It just felt like a slog to get through and a CGI mess that relied too heavily on the volume stage. Bottom 5 MCU film
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, not a masterpiece. Really enjoyed it!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to clench the undying thirst for the unknown within the Marvel Cinematic Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Universe, yet introduces so much that it doesn't really introduce anything at all. While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.

Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania  kicks off (or flies off, because‚Ä¶ ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly. 

For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way. 

Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.

I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!!! Great story line and script. Can‚Äôt wait for the next one!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just finish watching the movie in 3D and it was truly amazing, my two lil ones enjoyed the hack of it. I did went in with low expectations, however I dont always think the critics gets it right all the time. Most of the stuff I read is critics complaining about not having the same formula, well this is a new era, people evolved. Jonathan as Knag is breathtaking and love every scene hes in. I for one is super happy with this movie and cant wait to see whats next with Marvel."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was very entertaining and funny. There was a lot going on, but there was a lot of ground to cover. Visually stunning and a grand adventure "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun return to form for Marvel. Every critic who didn't like this movie probably smells their own farts. The first act could have been more cohesive, the actress for Cassie wasn't the best, but overall it was a fun time. If you like Marvel, you'll like this movie. 

""Oh it's more of the same bland Marvel formula.""
Look at the movies that have broken from that formula. Both Multiverse of Madness and the Eternals were garbage films. The Marvel formula works because it makes for fun movies, and that rings true for Ant-Man 3."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Forget what the critics say. This is the best Antman yet... with a perfect villain.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, Always a marvel fan"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I know what people have issues with however it did not bother me much and I have a different view of the movie. I had an amazing time watching this movie and thought that it had some great epic vibes.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Que los criticos expertos ni saben nada
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun and sets things up well. Kant is great and so is the Quantum realm. The script is messy and the CGI is sloppy though.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Looks like the ""critics"" have fully turned on Marvel and it's such a shame they've dog piled on what is actually the strongest outing for Ant man. Is it up there with the best, No but does it warrant the current 48% absolutely not!

Jonathon Majors has injected some life into this lagging phase and sets the tone for the new big bad, Kang. I'm personally excited to see this arc. And Paul Rudd anchors as his usual charming, likeable Scott Lang.

There is a decent story line, almost GOTG with a bit of Star Wars mixed in. It's a little cheesey in places and some of the dialogue is a bit clunky at times but overall it's a fun filled romp and the strongest stand alone Marvel film (not including the Spiderverse releases) since Endgame."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun and serious, I disagree with critics I think it has the same feel of the other two antman movies, I would rank it closely with AMATW."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the visual effects with more to come.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,really really fun movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"CGI ficou lindo, mas o filme √© fraco. √önico destaque para Hope e Scott √©... CHATOS! Filme colorido, muito lindo, por√©m o desenvolver do filme √© fraco demais. Destaques para Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer e Jonathan Majors, pois foram simplesmente descomunal, deram vida a seus personagens de uma forma original, plena, e simplesmente natural. Minha nota pra esse filme √© 3.5/4.0."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Antman and wasp quantumania is a mediocure, disaster with too many pointless, ruining comedic moments that wastes valuable time. Jonathan majors portrayal as kang is great yes however the filming material he was provided with was terrible. Unlike thanos, you do not feel  the hyped anticipation for another impending threat to the mcu but you feel disappointment towards the end of the movie as you realise the producers have ruined there last chance to redeem the the mcu franchise with their next big threat.

I'll continue no longer but if you are to watch this movie, don't have high hopes.

#MSUEND, #DCEU2NDCHANCE"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great, definitely need to stick around for the post credit scenes, both of them!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what the critics are on about, but I understand that this film isn't for everyone. This is obviously not a first-timer's MCU movie to jump in with, and for people that don't like absurdity as part of the creative elements of an MCU movie, you probably won't like it either. It's a solid 85% and Kang's legacy as a villain will step on Thanos like a boot on an ant."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,If you haven't watched Loki a lot of it won't be that great. If you have PEEEAAK.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It is great movie. must see for post credits scene
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The first two were better stories. This one was ok, although we'll be seeing ""a lot more"" of Kang"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The only bright moment in the movie was Jonathan Majors, and he CRUSHED it. His Kang adaptation was so profound and inspiring that I hope we get a solo Kang movie sooner!

The plot was trivial at best, and Janet was most likely the weakest character in the entire MCU proper - the secret handshake in the wasteland was baffling."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors's Kang is AWESOME! Really enjoyed the movie from start to finish. Does do a lot of setup but it's entertaining and the comedy definitely hit for me, especially the MODOK scenes! Can't wait to see this again and of course to see Kang in the future."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed this movie more than any Marvel movie since Spiderman No Way Home. Yes, Black Panther was good, but without Chadwick Boseman it wasn't the same. The so-called experts who are calling this the worst or one of the worst movies in the MCU need to get a grip. Sure, there were a few things that I questioned, hence the 3.5 rating. But, there was nothing so bad that made it worse than TLAT, Eternals, Dr Strange MoM, and a handful of others. Some of the logic being used to bash the film is hysterical. Folks need to get a grip. We are watching live action comic books, not Schindler's List."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the critics. Is the movie worth an Oscar? No!. Is the movie worth your money because it is entertaining, and fun? You bet. I had a great time. I loved the a lot of scenes. I loved King, the conqueror. I had a great time. I would see it again."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This film was a perfect start of MCU‚Äòs Phase 5. I don't know why the critics gave the film low ratings . So i recommend people watch this movie. It's a 10/10
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie.  Funny as always.  Interesting new villain.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"In my opinion, this movie was worth the wait, and even though there were a few things that could have been improved, I think it was a great experience and a good start for Phase 5 of the MCU üêú"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Any Man meets Star Wars people are saying and that's not a bad thing in this quirky yet very fun adventure that sees Ant Man and family go up against Kang the Conqueror. I had a lot of fun with this movie a lot like the other Ant Man films. The main difference is this one has better villains including MODOK
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a fun marvel movie, it's a movie for the fans but that shouldn't stop you from checking it out!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I definitely thought it was a solid movie. It setups for other MCU projects, which is great and all. I just wish there was a little more of Antman and Kang. The fight between them two (only) felt a little flat. I definitely would recommend to go see it."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jonathan Majors performance as Kang was good &  to see more of the quantum realm is all the reason you need to see the film on the big screen.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun story and thrilling introduction to Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's visually appealing and funny. All the characters were excellent. Another reason to not trust what the ""critics"" say. Great movie. Go see it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good movie best from the time off No Way Home and End Game. Funny and so weird that good a little like old fashion Star Wars movie but all it's about - entertainment.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,High Stakes action with heart and great character development. Really gets you excited for the next phase of the MCU!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hard to rate this solely as an Ant-Man sequel when it clearly is a kick-off to Phase 5 in earnest. That being said, the film did a great job of maintaining the light-heartedness and whimsiness of the first two films, while upping the ANT-e (sorry, not sorry) for the larger MCU entity. Furthermore, it is almost a better Star Wars movie than an Ant-Man movie; the amount of creatures and characters introduced is borderline Lucastonian (TM pending). My only gripe is that Luis is nowhere to be found. Here's hoping he is back for Ant-Man 4 to recap the entirety of Phase 5 in 2 minutes.

The main draw here, no doubt, is Jonathan Majors' Kang THE CONQUEROR. All eyes are on him due to the fact that he has been made known to be the big bad, a la Thanos, for this upcoming MCU phase.

All in all, I enjoyed the film and the table setting it put out for the future slate of MCU films and shows."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good movie. Would have liked it more if Scott Lane was more serious and joking all the time.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,i loved it!!!!! i don't know why critics hated it this movie is sick
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie to start off phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't really understand why it has such a low reviews, I think it is fun as the previous movies, the dynamics between the whole family was really awesome, familiar and comfortable. I'm really glad they didn't kill neither of the grandparents and Janet and Hope were such badasses. Jonathan Major's performance is amazing, I was terrified and sympathetic at the same time. Overall, I was just pleasently suprised sice I've seen so many low opinions. Definetely good start of phase 5!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Love The Movie Amazing Introduction To Another Kang Variant
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie felt a bit dragged at times but i actually loved the action. Its been quite a while since i enjoyed marvel action. The Ant family was a nice touch but Kang was the real star.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"All that time ‚Äô spent inside the green room.                      Strange worlds, but with ants."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Somehow worse than Love and Thunder. Didn‚Äôt think it was possible 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Big step up for Marvel's recent outputs. It was able to pave the way for upcoming MCU movies without taking away some of the charming characteristics of Ant-Man. Michelle Pfeiffer puts up a great performance as Janet van Dyne, but Jonathan Majors steals the show as Kand the Conqueror lives up to the hype. Michael Douglas' Hank Pym takes a back seat as more of a comic relief than in movies past, as the movie focuses back on the dynamic of Scott and Cassie rather than Hank and Hope. The creation of the Quantum Realm is a great highlight for Marvel's cinematography and shows wide-ranged inspiration from Star Wars all the way to Spy Kids. Overall, the dynamic between the light-hearted nature of Scott is tested by the intimidating figure of Kang, as Scott is forced to decide what type of father and Avenger he is post-Endgame."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Definitely the third best of the trilogy. Jonathan Majors is the best part of the movie with his performance of Kang. The rest of the movie is somewhat messy.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"√â um filme mediano ,e assistivel ent√£o essa nota pro filme , literalmente esta de bom tamanha ,o filme √© ruim e bom ao mesmo tempo ent √© isso mediano"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I heard somebody say I think they gave Kevin Feige a copy of shark boy and lava girl and he just said - ‚Äú ok run it ! ‚Äú . Kang is Epic ! The rest is meh . If you are an Ant Man fan you‚Äôll find some redeeming qualities
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Was expecting a lot more based on the trailer. Tried to be overly funny but not as much as Thor Love & Thunder. Was just OK to me. 1st Antman still the best one. Jonathan Majors was awesome. Saw it opening night. I thought the critics might be wrong but I see what they were saying.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It wasn't perfect but much better than the critics are saying. Not afraid to say it was a hell of a lot better than Wakanda Forever.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Film Was A Totally Roller Coaster Ride For Me, Kang's Tone Made Me Love For The Movie, Totally Outstanding Performance By Jonathan Majors And Paul Rudd,"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought the movie was good, but not great. They crammed a lot of stuff into this movie. It was a decent ride, but once again marvel falls flat with the jokes that were just not good. Overall it was entertaining"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed this movie more than any Marvel movie in Spiderman No Way Home. Yes, Black Panther was good, but without Chadwick Boseman it wasn't the same. The so-called experts who are calling this the worst or one of the worst movies in the MCU need to get a grip. Sure, there were a few things that I questioned, hence the 3.5 rating. But, there was nothing so bad that made it worse than TLAT, Eternals, Dr Strange MoM, and a handful of others. Some of the logic being used to bash the film is hysterical. Folks need to get a grip. We are watching live action comic books, not Schindler's List."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Heard nothing but bad things...I beg to differ had a great time! Paul Rudd is a treasure!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the movie. It felt like Antman just enough comedic content. I do think it needed to be longer to truly show off kangs character.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is quite enjoyable! The visuals are great and it is funny without being over the top. Lots of laughs in our theater! While it's not the game changer many are looking for at this point in the overall big picture and it tries to be too secretive for the first half hindering some of the one on one character moments we could have had, as a self contained story it's fun! My kid immediately wanted to watch it again."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Very enjoyable and best ant man movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A brilliant movie that falters due to a few small problems in the story.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Soooo good, probably my new favorite marvel movie tbh, idk why the critics are trashing this movie it was funny, some of the best action sequences, the animation was on point, they pulled modi's off surprising really well, and king was badass"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it! It wasn't a bad movie at all. Don't know why it got a bad rating for. Love and Thunder was the worst Marvel movie to me honestly. Can't wait until Kang's Return!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Which a ton of the jokes fall flat, Jonathan Majors' Kang is more than worth the price of admission."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was an entertaining movie with lots of decently funny humour but as a story I feel like there wasn't much filling. To me it felt like a movie to just see what those characters were up to. Nothing majorly interesting happened and whilst the effects, scenery and cinematography of the movie was good both the villain and hero really just didn't seem to do much. An entertaining movie but not one of the MCUs best."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just came out of the movie. My son told me: Dad this moving was so boring! And in a nutshell  that is it: boring.
Is not funny, special effects are nor amazing and movie fails over the clift after just 5 minutes. Getting tired of Marvel these days, nothing is the same after Endgame"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely loved the action!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,""" You mess with time, it tends to mess back"" - Tony Stark (Iron Man)

When we meet Kang in Quantamania, he tells one of the the characters that ""Time isn't what you think it is"". To the Ant family, time has many meanings. It's time loss for some. Scott Lang has missed a lot of time with his daughter Cassie. Between doing ""time"" in prison, the raft (Captain America : Civil War) , house arrest, and missing 5 while years or real world time while being stuck in the Quantum Realm (Avengers : Infinity War/ Endgame). For Hank, Hope, and Janet have also been dealt a bad hand with time dealing with the loss of Janet in the Q realm for 30 years. And it is in that time we see Janet's history with Kang the conqueror. A man that has been exiled out of time and had the means to get them both back. 

The movie itself is a mix of things, part traditional Ant-Man hesit film, part Guardians visuals/humor , and definitely borrows heavily from Star Wars. The movie also and sadly utilizes writer Jeff Loveness (Rick and Morty) style humor which I think brings the move down to it's lowest point. That amount of sillyness mixed in with a rebellion sub plot takes this movie into a unnecessary place that distracts for the main characters and the serious threat of Kang getting out of the Quantum Realm. Not to say I didn't laugh at some of the jokes but overall they weren't needed.

I also think the movie needed to be clearer on the motivations of Kang. You get an idea of what he is up to, but if you're not already familiar with him you're left to figure out what exactly he is overall capable of. But I would like to remind you all that are going into this that the point of him being exiled to the Quantum Realm is that he is unable to utilize his time chair and his full power. The Quantum Realm is a place out of time , so the danger here is him escaping. I think that was lost on a lot of reviewers. 

But make no make no mistake Jonathan Majors as Kang makes a huge impression and is set to be a major threat to the MCU going forward. I have my ideas of exactly what he means about time not being what you think just from the mid and after credit scenes. But again the movie itself could have benefitted more from some Easter eggs setting it up. 

All in all i like the Ant-Man trilogy and this is better than the second to me. It definitely doesn't deserve the full on review hate it's been getting from critics, but I think those are more to send Marvel a message to fix and explain this multiverse story we are diving into. With this being the 31st film in the MCU it's almost necessary now to have a previously in the MCU recap before every film that calls back to the things needed to know before watching the current film. With the announcement that things will now be slowing down production wise and even films being pushed back just today, I think they have heard and seen what isn't working and are getting back on track. Overall I'd give this movie a B (B-). I definitely want to see this again ."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved this movie, I have loved all the Ant-Man movies and am a marvel fan and in my opinion this didn't disappoint. It is more larger MCU oriented especially closer to the end, but my dad who has only seen the Ant-Man movies understood just fine and only asked for some more in-depth info about Kang out of what was more curiosity than confusion, and didn't understand the post-credit scene but that doesn't really matter unless you care about the greater MCU and if you don't it's not a big deal to not stay for the mid and end credits as they don't add much to the movie itself. Tech wise I thought the green screens and special effects worked great especially considering that because the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm it has to lean pretty heavily on the effects, but I honestly didn't even notice the effects just watching the movie and they only really add to the movie. I don't think the movie was as comedic as the first two but it was still quite funny and I definitely had a fair amount of laugh out loud moments. I thought the messaging was also quite good and I really liked how they worked it in to the movie itself, and the fight scenes were very interesting and didn't feel like they were dragging on and the movie didn't lean too much on the fighting. The acting was also quite good and believable and, the plot itself I thought worked great and didn't seem to have any plot holes and the build up was quite good. There is a little internal monologue at the beginning and the end of the movie but not enough to actually become annoying. And how the movie actually ended works so that it feels complete enough for someone who just wants to watch the Ant-Man movies to have a satisfying ending, and leaves enough for Marvel and MCU people to be excited for what will happen next. Over all I would totally recommend this movie to someone, invite everyone I know to see it with me, and then watch it about ten more times before it is even on Disney+. Barring in mind this is all my personal opinion and evaluation and I'm not a professional movie critic or anything, but I hope that anyone who took the time to read this (I know it's kinda long) found it helpful."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,awesome visuals and kang was amazing
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"All that I got out of the movie was Kangs are coming. But if antman and the team didn‚Äôt go into the quantum realm, then nothing would have changed in the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I loved the AntMan movies. This one was boring with no stakes. The CGI wasn‚Äôt the best. The jokes fell flat. There was no relating to this film, and of course, in the latest Disney fashion lately, social justice warrior-ing. The word ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù thrown around to describe an ant-colony in the quantum realm. ü•¥ This film was a total letdown. I figured the film would maybe not be as bad as the previews but I was wrong. This direction for marvel has gone from mediocre to worse. They need to get their act together. Ever since Eternals, the films have gotten worse. I hated Doctor Strange and the Multiverse and the ones after (with exception to the last SpiderMan). Goodness, I‚Äôm writing this review while WATCHING it, which means I could care less for watching the rest of it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The reviews are so stupid , it was good enough"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,E um filme aceitavel 8/10 a √∫nica coisa que eu  n√£o gostei  foi do modok e de n√£o terem falado muito do plano do kang E mostra-lo como um conquistador de fato
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie! But the most exciting element to come from this film, is Jonathan Major's Kang, the perfect heir to the Thanos void that has been missing from the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are really just against superhero movies but whatever, the movie us fun, entertaining and really sets the next phase pretty great IMO."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you take the movie as is and not as part of the rest of the MCU,  this is a movie about family, responsibility, and looking out for the little guy."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,There isn't quite enough plot and some of the humor fails to land but it is a lot of fun.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Majors, Paul Rudd, and Michelle Pfeiffer do a great job with what they have in this movie. But this movie falls flat with its confusing storyline and terrible writing, Ant-mans daughter is unlikeable in the first 45 minutes of this movie because of the writing. It's an OK movie, see it once so you are up to date with the Kang storyline but it isn't worth a second viewing."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"MODOK was the best part. I wish the movie was 20mins longer to show us HOW Kang conquered the Quantum realm. Also since it's set in SF, I wish there was a minor cameo from a Shang-Chi character to give it THAT MCU feel. Overall 7/10"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme talvez esteja sendo criticado pela expectativa que criou. Mas a√≠ a culpa √© de quem esperou um Ultimato num filme do Homem Formiga. 
O filme √© aquilo que eu esperava. Encerra sua hist√≥ria nele mesmo e deixa pontas para o futuro. S√≥ fa√ßo uma ressalva sobre o que fizeram com o MORDOK. Mas de resto, aprovado."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not perfect but a good movie , not the best ant man movie but good way to start phase 5 , while I had some issues with it I don't get this hate for the movie like it's not the greatest thing ever but y'all did the same with wakada forever and that movie  was good don't listen to rotten tomatoes or the stupid people who review it they look for masterpieces and yet the ones who are master pieces such as Pearl and X of last year have less of a tomato score than they should these people don't know movies if you want a action packed , funny ride this is the movie kangs great , Antwan is great , shit even kassie is great she's had a funny line in this movie that made my theater laugh out loud , it's a good movie to much hate fr"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good find. Dont want to spoil it
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, my family enjoyed, much like other Marvel films.  Some may not enjoy that almost the entire film is cgi background and characters.   A good popcorn film."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great 3rd movie comedy and action throughout, very entertaining."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Disappointed in the overall outcome of the movie. CG was clunky. Backgrounds took me out of it. The acting was good, Paul Rudd is a treasure but Kang is the draw. Look forward to his future in the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie. Critic's and dumb moaners online are just depressing and wrong, fed up of reading the negative idiotic rubbish. This is another MCU classic! Great movie!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie High mid Tier Marvel movie 
Jonathan Majors was perfect for this role Michelle pfeiffer character stand out in this film"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie delivers mostly everything that I want in an Ant-Man movie. A fun adventure with a light tone with relatively small stakes while simultaneously starts Phase 5. I think this is the best Ant-Man movie. I know many people will say this movie only focuses on styles and visuals, has zero substance, and has no emotional weight.

Here are things that I love :
1. Jonathan Majors, as Kang, is easily the best character in this movie. He is menacing, compelling, and has such gravity that makes Kang the most badass human in the entire multiverse.
2. Michelle Pfeiffer slays in every scene she's in. Even though she does a lot of exposition, she delivers a stunning performance. Her scenes with Jonathan Majors are some of the best highlights of this movie.
3. Paul Rudd and Kathryn Newton's dynamic and chemistry are cute and definitely the heart of this movie. It's refreshing and beautiful.
Paul Rudd is funny, as always. He is a National Treasure.
4. The world-building, the characters' design, and the final battle action, especially when Cassie punch the hell out of MODOK.. are great and hella entertaining. I know some of them are heavily influenced by Star Wars, GOTG, and Avatar, but I still really enjoy them.
5. Bill Murray is a joy to watch. In a few minutes, he's in, and he stole the scene. What a fun surprise.
6. The post-credit scenes are fantastic.
7. The multiple Ant-Man scene is comedy gold. The VFX also so pleasing. I love Baskin-Robin Scott Lang.
8. A lof of hillarous sceces. The humor is spot on.
9. And lastly, Ryan Bergara is in this movie. I smiled so hard when I saw him.

Few parts that I did not like
1. MODOK CGI is a bit goofy. Also, I thought he was wasted in here. He is an awesome character in the comic book.
2. Kang is overwhelmed by the army of ants..., come on.., I admit it's fun, but also very weird. He should be able to exterminate them all with ease. But the ants are OP as hell.
3. Cassie nonchalantly builds a portal to save Scott and Hope at the end.
4. I would love if this movie shows how Kang conquered the Quantum Realm civilization and finally built his empire. It would make me more invested in Jenorra's character. The storytelling is a bit sketchy here.
5. Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne are heavily underused. Especially Hope, does not get enough screen time.

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania overall is an enjoyable movie, not a perfect MCU movie, but absolutely better than Thor, Love and Thunder, and Doctor Strange 2."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is Ant-Man does a subatomic Star Wars. It‚Äôs good, but not the best thing ever. There are high points like Johnathan Majors, and some low points including one bit that is way overplayed. Better than several Phase 4 movies, but there‚Äôs room to grow. The critical reviews don‚Äôt make sense, this is better than Love and Thunder and worse than Wakanda Forever or No Way Home, about on the level with Multiverse of Madness."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Sofr√≠vel. No trailer voc√™ j√° sente vergonha alheia pelos atores.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed the Movie, I've read some negative comments and honestly I don't get any of them. Some people say kang is not in the film enough but he's a prelude to the entire kang saga, he's in it enough for the story and is played very well through the whole thing.

Probably my favourite MCU film in quite a while.
Ignore the critics"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews but ugh! And I‚Äôm a big Marvel movie fan. Kang was the highlight of the movie. 
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was awesome. Only MODOK was dissapointment.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great introduction of kang into the mcu, he was such a badass and im glad we get to see multiple different variants in the coming movies"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,OK.  They should have given Kang more screen time!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Eu gostei muito, por√©m tem muitas cenas e falas bem ruins, MORDOK, n√£o precisava estar nesse filme. Jonathan Majors como KANG est√° absurdo de incrivel, atua√ß√£o de dar MEDO! Muito bom no geral."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film was entertaining to watch! There were, however a few spots were the dialogue could have been scripted better. There wasn't too much backstory on Kang the conqueror, but I'm assuming that is being saved for Loki season 2"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was fantastic. It was not as funny as the previous ones. this one got a little more serious. still a fantastic movie and I would definitely go see it again.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Better movie than given credit and the right amount of EXPECTED Ant-Man movie laughs with a dash more action than anticipated.  A good time enjoyed and overall fun for all.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fight scenes were Awesome. The movie was great.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film did exactly what it needed to, nothing more nothing less. Sure Kang was intense, sure Cassie Lang is cute and learning to kick ass, sure Scott Lang is a good father, but no need to rewatch probably for the rest of my life."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Visually beautiful and not too M she U heavy but Disney just can't help but to push political agendas as with their socialism vomment made by Michael Douglas.  I miss the days when I could escape into a movie without overt political messages.  Sad that the once great MCU is going down that road.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"the fight sequences were excellent as well as the action in general was pretty good and the comedy was fairly entertaining it seemed like they were holding back quite a bit of shenanigans but it seemed like they were putting more effort into the storyline and build up to it and the storyline was very different from the first two Ant-Man movies, but it had some potential and it was weird but interesting and it left you wanting to learn more about the Quantum realm and yes there is something at the end afterwards, and I can honestly say this was a lot better than the last few Marvel movies not as good as Spider-Man no way home but it was definitely a lot better than Captain Marvel and way better than The Eternals and Thor Love & Thunder.

And I have to say Jonathan Majors was on point as Kang the Conqueror and I can't wait to see what he's going to be doing next in Loki season 2 and what they will put them in for other cameos in other Avenger movies.

and there is a cameo of Loki & Morbius wasn't very small Cameo with Kang at the very end credits."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not sure if my expectations were too high but the movie just didn't deliver like I thought it would. The official intro to Kang lived up to the hype but the rest of the movie was just ""meh"" in my opinion. Now I'm starting to get worried about this new phase and where the MCU is going to take us."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Antman and the Wasp Quantamania was a great showing of the new big bad villain Kang and what is to come next for the MCU. The movie struggled to execute an original plot but was good in my opinion for what it is. It was a fun watch with great characters. Antman, Janet, and Kang were the spotlights of the film and overall it was enjoyable."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing intro to the multiversal saga
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Villain is top notch.  Good amount of room to expand on Kang throughout the MCU projects.  Paul Rudd is still fun to watch and he has plenty of fun romping through this movie.  Everybody has their moment in this one without it feeling forced like a few scenes in Endgame.  I really like some of the call backs and new tangents that are possibly set up by this movie.  Lifelong comics fan.  Quantummania is a fun watch and worth your time.   There are 2 post credit scenes to watch for.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing worth watching will see again !! Don't forget 2 ending credits!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what movie these critics saw, but I LOVED this film!  It wasn't my favorite MCU movie by far, but I thought it was great.  I rolled with laughter several times, one in particular towards the end.  If you know, you know.  I'm going to see this at least one more time in full IMAX!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie to watch in theaters, good rewatchability."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie had so much to do, introduce kang, start phase 5, tease the The New Avengers and Kang Dynasty etc. The first act of the movie is the weakest until Jonathan Majors appears, his performance is the best part of the film, he is menacing and terrifying, although Kang is not well constructed as a real menace in this movie but for the future, still i can't wait to see Kang again, the cgi is pretty good with some horrible shots with the bad use of The Volume, Michelle Pfeiffer steals the show and her scenes with kang are the best ones of the entire film, i heard they change the ending and I am so disappointed about that because the ending of the film really could have been  much better. MODOK is useless in this film and is only there to show Darren Cross again. Jeff Loveness presents a very decent script, bit generic but decent, the problem is that Is just not executed well, Peyton Reed is not just the guy to direct this films, wishing for Loveness and Cretton combination to  work for The Kang Dynasty.

The post-credit scenes are great, some of the best I have seen in years, especially the second one."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors' performance was amazing. The menacing calm with which Majors plays the antagonist is makes the character intimidating to say the least. It was definitely a film that sets up what's to come, but still a strong stand alone introduction to KANG. Watch a Loki season one recap if you can for a more texture appreciation of the film."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love Marvel, but this just got too weird and trippy for my taste. For such an unbelievable cast, it's the first Marvel movie I don't want to watch twice."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Was the best entry of the Antt-man franchise!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"In my opinion, I enjoyed the movie. How it took the movie seriously HOWEVER keeping the normal Antman movie style."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a BOOM üí£ 
5/5 my personal rating .... After a long time Marvel doing a wonderful job ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cgi good. Story is good . Modok is not bad but not even good. Kang is awesome , War at the End is like Endgame end fight for me. Everywhere is a lot of shot and fight ."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was awesome! Overall fun movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really really enjoyed Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania, regardless of how the critics are bashing it being one of the worst MCU films. This was never supposed to be the typical ""Ant-Man"" film, it was always setup to be more serious and with just about everyone for the past 2 yrs saying they are tired of the comedy in all the MCU films and with this not being the way critics expected they decided to shit on it. Go in watch the movie and have fun don't let the negative reviews or comments deter your experience."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was a very good intro to phase 5.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics may not appreciate high-concept movies, but this is a good one that Marvel fans should enjoy."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible cinematography, funny as Antman always is, good CGI, and a great intro of Kang the Conqueror."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania is really interesting in that they've taken a fundamentally  ensemble approach to a cosmic story. It's important to get this out of the way from the beginning, because Quantumania is as far removed from the first Ant Man film as Star Wars is from American Graffiti. One of the things that really disappointed me about Ant Man and the Wasp , the second film of the series, was that it was such a departure from the first Ant Man. indeed, it really should have entitled the Wasp and Ant Man as Ant Man is basically a guest star in his own movie. If you want to make a movie about the Wasp, Go ahead and do that, but let me know when the title, instead of pulling a sort of bait and switch. And it's not that the Wasp and Ant Man was a bad movie, it just wasn't a good one. It's not particularly memorable. It's completely wastes the resources it has in Lawrence Fishbourne, and was really at the forefront of the MCU It fell right into the tropes of shifting focus to female characters, along with pulling gender swaps and diminishing legacy characters in order to try and make the women look better by comparison. (Which I always thought was a weird approach. You don't build someone up by tearing somebody else down). With the exception of a few fun bits with Scott and Cassie at the very beginning, there's just not a lot to talk about with the Wasp and Ant Man. I've watched that movie twice. Once in a theater, and once at home with my daughter. The first Ant Man on the other hand, I've watched more times than I can count. That's the movie Quantumania really has to compare to.

So, does it?

Much to my surprise, it does. It really does. It also has the unenviable task of kicking off phase 5, while at the same time trying to reignite an interest in the MCU that's very much run out of steam.  Sure, you can claim conspiracy theory when people talk about theaters screening Captain Marvel consistently empty despite supposedly high ticket sales. However, the advanced screening that I went to for Quantumania?  It was a ghost town. We actually arrived late, and still had our pick of just about any seats we wanted. By the time the film started to roll, My daughter and I still had empty spots on either side of us. That's unthinkable for a free screening of a Marvel movie. At least, it would be unthinkable  before Infinity War. Or more of a, before captain Marvel. There is definite superhero fatigue, and the MCU has done a lot to drive its brand into the ground. What you can see though in Quantumania, is a real attempt to change that and win viewers back.

The ensemble approach works really well here. We have a cohesive team working together, much the way we've gotten used to seeing on the various CW shows like the Flash. Everybody gets a time to shine, everybody gets a character arc, everybody gets to grow. Everybody gets a chance to be heroic. I was particularly impressed by Cassie, Scott's daughter, now grown up. She's now trying to do some super heroine stuff in her own right. The film could have very easily been about her. In years past, it would have been, giving us a perfect hero, who's instantly good at everything. Not so here. Cassie has flaws. Indeed, a lot of what's going on in this movie may well be her fault. She doesn't know everything, although she thinks she does. But as the film progresses, she discovers that she might just have a thing or two to learn about being a superhero from her dad. This is great characterization. There's complexity and depth, It's truly a breath of fresh air.

Gone also, is much of the identity politics and social messaging. Oh there's still a bit here and there. A reference to ""peaceful protesting"" (but fiery?) And a quick gag about socialism. But this is the sort of stuff that we would have all pretty much just ignored and moved along with six years ago, before Hollywood sort of lost their mind and started prioritizing the message over storytelling.  Indeed, the film is actually a bit self aware. It understands that you're coming in with some skeptical predispositions. I recall seeing Modock come on screen, and thinking ""oh, they're just  making him into a joke I see. Not sure I like that."" But before a 1/2 hour has passed, they've shifted, and he's no longer a joke. He's a serious threat. By the end of the film he'll break your heart. This is a far cry from the way shows like She Hulk handled their criticism. Instead of attacking their fans and their critics the way She Hulk did, Quantumania takes you on a ride, seizeing your criticisms, and then addresses of them by twisting and morphing, turning into exactly what actually wanted it to be in the first place. Early on I found myself rolling my eyes wondering ""who do they think they are? The next Guardians of the Galaxy?"" but by the time we hit the 3rd act I was nodding my head.They had actually done it. This really is the next Guardians of the Galaxy.

Like Guardians of the Galaxy, this is one of those movies that you are really going to want to see in the theater. I don't care how good your home theater set up is, to really appreciate the sprawling cityscapes and amazing environments of this lost universe, you have to see it on a big screen. And that's what I'm hoping you're going to do. Go see this in the theater. This is a genuinely good movie, And for the first time in quite a while, I have hope for the MCU. I'll be heading back with my friends to see it again next week. I hope I'll see you there too."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just loved the movie, very beautiful, interesting and enigmatic."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was alright, I felt like the writing was a bit rushed but other than that it was just alright."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than the critics say, functions more as an introduction to kang rather than ant man movie only big flaw."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente, fui con las expectativas bajas y las cumpli√≥ xd"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film was very entertaining, great simple story, good connection to Loki with the rest of the MCU and it's a very Beautiful Film. I kind of wish it's a little bit longer but I wasn't board of the movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"4 stars is about right for this movie. It was world building for the next phase for the MCU. Could it have done more yes, could scotts crew have been involved yes. but kasey and the grandparents made up for it. hopefully the next few movies are better scriptted since we now have the beginning of Kang taken care of"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The first act feels rushed but after that movie does slowly start to pick up momentum. The rest of the movie is a fun ride with great performances from Kathryn Newton and Johnathan Majors and a really fun climax.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"You can tell those Meta Critics who give their opinion arent really true Marvel fans. Sadly, Marvel movies has been in a very bad position due to the Phase 4 but Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the exception. Visually splendid, very good plot even though the introduction to a specific character in the movie couldve been explored even more. This movie brings the art of a Hero performance and it really brings out the best for every single actor in the movie. Perfect introduction for Kang the Conqueror and sets up the next movies that are waiting ahead of us. Totally recommended!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,I have always liked the characters Ant-Man and the Wasp from the comic books this film is the first to take the characters into a larger realm.  Though. it keeps  true to the comics original ideas.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Ah-May-Zing!!!! stay after for the two post credit views!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Was stupid and boring.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was pointless. This movie was about to ""set-up"" Kang as a huge villain, Thanos-Level threat, but it failed. The only threat is that there are many Kangs. Also, we watched two of the most important villains being ridiculed for no reason at all. Also, Marvel, or to be specific, Feige didn't learn from his mistake and for one more time put jokes into situation that don't really need a joke. Don't waste your money on a cinema ticket for this movie. It does not contribute to the universe,not at all"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,enjoyed the approaching theme of multiverse making things happen.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So glad I didn't listen to the critics.  This was a good Ant Man movie.  It seems like the people who give this movie bad reviews feel like every MCU movie needs to be Endgame.  This movie has action and fun, and has me looking forward to what comes next."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film made a mockery of the new villain Kang. A great performance by J Majors but everything he did is belittled by the immature silly and misplaced humour. The silly humour with characters like a pink jelly Olaf takes you out of the world they are trying to create, reminding you of silly characters and humour from our own current world. This silly humour even appears in the major dramatic scenes at the end of the movie, so much so that you never take Kang seriously, despite Majors' excellent performance. Marvel used to get the balance of humour and drama correct, placing the emotions and drama in the right scenes with the right kind of humour, if any, at these times. This film failed so badly that the new villain seems silly too. Some good acting performances let down by bad bad writing."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"No es ""Civil War"" como promet√≠an, pero la pel√≠cula tiene buen rumbo. Lo √∫nico decepcionante fue M.O.D.O.K. 
Kang es sin duda el personaje que mas atrae y sobresale."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"On the one hand: the MCU is convoluted and muddled. On the other: Paul Rudd. So this was a typical superhero movie with explosions, fighting, lasers, CGI, etc. Paul Rudd is pretty great (relationships with the family could have been fleshed out better when you have great actors/characters but a big miss here). The setting of the quantum realm allowed for creativity and resolved the issue of ""where are the other avengers?"" This movie was kind of fun and I was entertained, but totally forgettable too."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very clunky beginning, the first hour feels a little laborious. I wish there had been more backstory to Janet's experience in the Quantum Realm prior to the group going back down again. It felt rushed getting to Kang but also felt long at the same time. However, once the stakes were raised, the movie got great and felt like a return to good Marvel movies. The MODOK reveal and introduction was also very cool and the post-credit scenes are the greatest to date."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it! Being a Kang fan, it was awesome to see him in his element and a great performance of him by Jonathan Majors. Paul Rudd is as charming and funny as always, and of course, the rest of the crew was too! It was awesome in 3-D and I plan on going back to rewatch it soon!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this fun entry into the MCU. It was kinda weird, I loved Kang and all of the characters in this movie. It had a strange choice in the finale, but definitely a strong start to phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know why the critics are so down on this movie. I enjoyed it, the movie was fun and the world was beautiful to see. It had heart and the action was decent. My only issue was MODOK's face, I can get past the huge head tiny arms and legs, but something about his face looked like it was a projection or something. Enjoyed Majors as Kang, quiet and reserved but also menacing. I look forward to seeing more Kang(s)"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had a really good time with this movie. Not sure why some reviews are so negative about it. Great acting, cool action scenes, and humor that was actually funny! Wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing it again!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing acting led by Jonathan Majors.  The visual effects are much better than some of the recent Marvel installments.  Definitely the best, and most emotional of the Ant Man movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I lord Antman, the story, and KANG!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" indeed embodied the spirit of a Marvel film, but unfortunately, it fell short in a few aspects that affected the overall enjoyment. The movie had a sense of fun, but the lackluster ending and the inclusion of a silly plot diminished its impact.

The film started off strong, with engaging humor, exciting action sequences, and the familiar chemistry between the characters that we've come to expect from the Ant-Man series. However, as the story progressed, it became apparent that the plot was lacking depth and substance. The stakes didn't feel as high as they should have been, and certain plot elements felt contrived or forced.

Moreover, one notable drawback was the noticeable and occasionally distracting use of poor CGI in some scenes. This flaw took away from the immersive experience and made certain moments feel less polished than they should have been. It's disappointing when technical issues like this become noticeable and detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.

Despite these shortcomings, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" still managed to capture the trademark Marvel charm. It embraced the light-heartedness and humor that have become hallmarks of the franchise, allowing for some enjoyable moments throughout the movie. Fans of the Ant-Man series and those who appreciate the more comedic side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe may still find elements to enjoy.

In the grand scheme of Phase 4, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" contributed to expanding the Marvel universe and exploring the intriguing concept of the Quantum Realm. However, it didn't quite reach the same heights as some of the previous Marvel films, leaving some viewers craving a more substantial and captivating story.

In conclusion, while ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" embodied the Marvel essence and had its moments of fun, the lackluster ending, silly plot, and issues with CGI hindered its overall impact. It may appeal to fans of the franchise or those seeking a lighthearted Marvel experience, but it fell short of delivering a truly remarkable cinematic adventure."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent very entertaining movie, I don't understand how critics boo this movie if this movie introduces the next great Marvel villain."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie wasn't really good at all, it felt lazily written and the jokes and dialogue seemed so forced. The antagonist Kang is a bright spot to this movie and he was menacing enough to keep me drawn in."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun theater experience. The film's family aspect was sweet and Jonathon Majors proves he was the right choice for Kang. All the actors did a great job and it was nice having a cast full of pros really anchor the story. I'm going to watch it again this weekend with some friends. The only reason I docked a star was for MODOK. No shade towards Corey Stoll, but there was no reason to include this character, at least in the way they did."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania
Spoiler free review.
Overall 7.5/10
Cgi 10/10
Story 7.9/10
Connections to other films of mcu : Noticeably.
Kang 8/10
This film is way better than what people claim to be, it is an antman film and it does the job for what it's meant to be and sets up big things for the Mcu. Peoples unwanted expectations and hype keeps them from enjoying this film and facing disappointment if ur expectations aren't met isn't a fair judgement. Good watch, fun time, very important for the rest of the films in phase 5. Watch it and make your own statment for yourself and don't be influenced by others opinion and views."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good but definitely could‚Äôve been better. Kang is great!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had everything a Marvel movie needs - Fun characters, great visuals, engaging action, a good storyline and an AMAZING villain. It started of a bit slow, it wasn't perfect, but it was really enjoyable start to finish. Kang was as awesome as you could imagine and the mid/post credits scenes set up the future of Kang and the MCU in a real interesting way."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, final introduces the big bad of the new marvel era. It‚Äôs a classic ant man movie where they put comedy above all but the formula works great. Wasp is a side character in this movie even though her name is in the total but with the type of movie they‚Äôre going for it worked as well"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"La cr√≠tica le esta dando duro solo por gusto, vaya vean la peli"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it. Welcome back Ant-Man
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"As someone who enjoys the comics, I liked this movie. Not sure why there's so much hate from critics"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it's a fun movie with quirky visuals. some fun jokes, some good action. Middle of the pack as far as Marvel movies are concerned"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie my movie theater had a power surge I‚Äôll watch tomorrow:(
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Again, no real stakes. Kang's writing is awful and makes him look very soft. MODOK is just a joke in the MCU so what was the point in including this character if he wasn't going to be taken seriously by anyone?! So many missed opportunities."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! It was a great comic book movie! Definitely on the right track and gives me hope for the future of Marvel‚Äôs next phase! 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the film, best ant man of out of all them!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"More serious than the previous 2 movies, though i loved the first 2 movies as well.
For me, it was really getting me of my seat, really into the story of the characters, of Scott and Kang.
Deserves a 4/5 out of 5, must see in the cinema."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Clearly the critics are not fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, because I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Most of the complaints were about the plot being all over the place but the plot was pretty straightforward because I ACTUALLY WATCHED the other projects that ties into the story. So if you if havent watched them, I would at least suggest watching Loki and Multiverse of Madness to at least understand what the franchise is pushing towards. While it wasn't as funny as the last two installments, I do appreciate a more serious tone when you're plot is centered the introduction of the next big villain. I wasnt feeling the ending but the post credit scenes definitely gave me something to look forward to. Regardless, if you're a fan of the MCU, don't listen to the critics score!! Enjoy yourself!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really great non-stop action, excellent story - need to watch it again for all the small details!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-man and wasp Quantumania is amazing has good effects ecenas of action and amazing performances A good start to the fifth phase of the UCM
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Overall 80% but it's still something you should watch on a big tv or theaters. Love modok finally appears and Kang is awesome! For an antman movie it was good!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Se siente plana en su ejecuci√≥n, sin embargo cumple con entretener al espectador. Kang es un villano imponente y la actuaci√≥n de Majors es de lejos lo mejor de la pel√≠cula."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was good.explorable.good start for phase 5.marvel now you are coming to right track again keep it.mind it quality over quantity that's important.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure what movie the critics were watching. Not the best entry for the MCU, but entertaining and fun! Majors is the real deal."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dialogue was very bland, but Jonathan Majors brought his A-game! It cleared up a lot of questions for marvel fans concerning the multi-verse, and the end credit scenes, set up future MCU projects!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Felt like there was a lot missing from the movie as far as how powerful Kang really is. The movie should‚Äôve been a bit longer. I was glad to hear about Jannette‚Äôs story and how she knew a lot about the quantum realm. All in all feel like it was really great but as a fan of marvel I could tell there were missing elements.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Glad to see Marvel back to its prime, great movie can‚Äôt wait to see more. "
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie just doesn't have a huge riveting plot. Yes the special effects and graphics are great, but other than that the movie plot is simple almost boring. The Same Ol.....Same Ol...."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"very good movie, better than what the 48% shows"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie was crazy setting up future marvel events and the cgi was really cool too

"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cringey, but in the best way. Felt like a rip of several other franchises put together, but self aware. Even the parts I didn't love, I liked. I was throughly entertained. Paul Rudd is delightful, Jonathan Majors is excellent. As much as I knew where it was going, I found how we got there interesting. Janet sucks, but is well acted. Cassie is annoying, but still feels real. All in all, probably in my top five list of marvel movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The ""pro"" critics seem to have all jumped on the ""hate Marvel"" bandwagon. This was a fun and fantastic film that did something most in Phase 4 didn't do; progress the story. It had stakes, it had possibly long lasting consequences, and even some touching moments too. Yes the MCU was all over the place the last few years, and many films seemed to come and go without mention anywhere else (Eternals, you'd think someone else would have mentioned a massive celestial sticking out of the ocean) but it seems Phase 5 is off to a great start. The only reason I didn't go for a full 5 stars is the VFX can be spotty in places, likely due to the massive backlog and work VFX artists are trying to keep up with. 

Ignore the haters, see this movie, you won't regret it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan majors was fantastic
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Contrary to other ""critic"" reviews - this film was easily the best Ant Man yet! We are not comparing this to Avengers of Thor. As its own movie and a set up to the next phase of the MCU I feel this movie was great. It gave me everything I wanted out of it and not too mention Kang was intense and easily up there with Thanos. Paul Rudd was wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and you should too."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Had fun and enjoyed the film.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't know why people hate this! Great start to phase 5!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Est√° piola, sale Megamente ü´ê"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I personally loved this movie, it had great callbacks to the previous two and is a great jumping off point for the next phase. Some parts could have been drawn out more but overall worth a watch"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing!! Increble!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's an AntMan movie plan and simple don't go in expecting an Endgame level experience. It's a simple story to introduce that next great villain. On that note Jonathan Majors is the standout and KANG is absolutely ruthless.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es un inicio espectacular para la Fase 5 de Marvel, ant man, wasp, cassie, hank, janet, cada uno lo hace de maravilla, es una pel√≠cula emocionante, con efectos especiales espectaculares, el reino cu√°ntico es tomado en serio y hay escenas que sinceramente me conmovieron hasta las l√°grimas, los di√°logos son coherentes, la historia es congruente, es sencillamente una pel√≠cula que ver√© much√≠simas veces m√°s"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very fun watch and Jonathan Majors absolutely makes it worth watching. Characters all feel like themselves for better and for worse. Very much like other MCU movies, doesn't try much new. Probably not worth a rewatch but definitely worth watching once and very important to the overall MCU storyline."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel hit the rock bottom with this.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie and definitely worth the watch. The end credits are great and Jonathan majors as kang was incredible. I'm very excited to see what happens next. The CGI was great and the story was very fast paced, it felt similar to star wars. I do think kang was done a little dirty and they should have established him as a major villain by allowing him to kill more people."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Aburrida, clich√©, innecesaria y totalmente olvidable, lo de marvel ya cae en lo risible, otra pel√≠cula gen√©rica mas del mont√≥n."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, one of the best Marvel's post Endgame projects so far."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The critics can say what they want about it. If you are a true marvel fan, you will enjoy this movie. Sure, it does not compare to that of end game or infinity war. However, it starts off Phase 5 in a big way. Plenty of action, great characters/emotions"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazingly quirky, and Kang!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,this is by far the best one out of the Ant-Man trilogy Johnathan majors kills it as kang
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It‚Äôs pre good.. A lot of fun‚Ä¶
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme Top demais, KANG TA INCRIVEL"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie will ride the line between great and okay.... unfortunately, that will be dependent on its place in the overall story within this saga, much like The Eternals. Visually, the movie was beautiful, and the action sequences were outstanding.  Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show, making Kang as fearsome as they come. The story.... well, the story was where this one was two notches from great. There were times when there should've been a little less comedy, given the gravity of the overall story. But it didn't make it any less entertaining. All in all, it is an amazing addition to the MCU and a must-see for fans and newcomers alike!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed it. Not a masterpiece but much better than some critics are saying
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I honestly wanted to like this movie so much more than I did. The visuals were fantastic, performances were great, especially Michelle Pfieffer and more so Jonathan Majors, who was amazing and terrifying, but the movie was generic and rushed. M.O.D.O.K I'm sorry to say was horrible, too much of a comic relief character to be anything important, and overall the final act was very disappointing. However, it is a fitting start to phase 5 and should be very necessary for the whole big picture marvel is trying to draw. It's fun, messy, thrilling, disappointing, and short, but not necessarily a bad movie. It just was a little bit underwhelming."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think its rated too low, the cgi was amazing, a little bit messy in parts but i didnt mind because the movie was reslly good, some good humour, i wish modok was a little bit more serious, i adored the family together and the relationships between them, i loved the relationship between hope and scott but i wished they kissed. for once. and then kang was incredible i loved him and i want more of him!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was better than what all the nerds on YouTube were telling me. The CGI didn't bother me like I thought it would. Love the character Kang. Cassie didn't annoy me which is refreshing for a child character. Love the protective father angle they went with Scott. But it would be better to call this Ant Family and the Quantemania than just Antman and Wasp and Q. This was better than the second movie which was surprising. Watch the movie how you can. And judge it for yourself but I think this is alittle bit return to form for marvel. Getting back to plot instead of introducing what feel like side characters/plots.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best kickoff for phase 5ü•µüí•üî•
And MARVEL is backüòå‚ú®Ô∏è
Cry more dc kidzzzzzüóø"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I can see why it scored so low, it wasn't a movie at ALL! It was a damn CGI showcase of the quantum realm. The only redeeming factor was Kang the Conqueror. Jonathan Majors is easily the best part of the film, his character brings this disturbing and chilling feeling that Thanos wasn't able to give to me. Also the cheesy deux ex machina of every rebel fighter coming in at the last second to save the good guys? Disney sure loves that plot device

The movie felt devoid of substance that makes it memorable, just like the second ant-man film, who genuinely remembers anything in that? At least they nailed Kang and sets him up as a major villain."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's not the worst MCU movie but it's pretty damn close. This is absolutely dissapointingü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The first two thirds of the movie is just enjoyable and it doesn't offer anything new or refreshing. The story and most of the characters fall flat. Jonathan Major's Kang the conqueror is the best part of the movie but his character seems to be wasted in the third act. In the end it is just another boring and schematic superhero film. Marvel needs to hit the breaks and rethink their strategy. Regardless I still think that James Gunn and Nia DaCosta will deliver good MCU projects this year.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics on this one, if you're in to Marvel, it's definitely enjoyable.  Yes, there's some cheesy family love, but hey that's what Scott Lang is after.  Jokes didn't feel forced (looking at you Thor L&T and Guardians 2), and action sequences are decent.  Yes there's a lot of CGI, but I honestly don't know how they could get around that being in an entirely made up creative world.  

Go, enjoy it, and then wonder why the critics hate it so much like me."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,They explored the quantum realm civilization well. The dynamic between scott and cassie was good. Since the kang here was just a variant and don't expect a full showdown. we just started the journey. barely the surface. personally I'm very happy with the movie and especially those two after credits scenes.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was great!  The visual effects were awesome!  Fun night at the movies!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Ant-Man Movie üëå
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of great build up. Visually stunning. Way better than expected. Johnathan Majors was phenomenal!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is a bit slow but entertaining I liked the performance of Jonathan majors as kang
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,O filme √© leve e bem melhor que os dois anteriores. Kang √© um √≥timo vil√£o e os personagens est√£o bem carism√°ticos. Dessa nova fase com certeza √© um dos melhores.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just saw this Movie today at the Cinema. It so freaking good. The quantum realm look so good then I imagined. Cassie is adorable still, Scot funny as ever, Hope has become more interesting and look really good,  Jane has also become an interesting character with many juicy secretsüòâ, Hank is now a nice sweet man who really does love his family and finally Kang the freaking conqueror is super insane character and power wise can't wait to see him in the future of the MCU. Now what are you waiting for go to the cinema and watch this amazing movie üçø."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is much better than the critics are giving it credit for. It does still suffer from Marvel's trend of trying to one-up their previous movie in terms of effects, humor and story. The over-the-top visuals/effects, all over the place crazy story elements and characters and the need to try and insert humor in every single scene is proving a bit much. It doesn't need to be SO nuts. And it doesn't have to have a joke in every scene. That said, Paul Rudd is the perfect hero for the humor and the jokes mostly land here. Even MODOK was actually fine except for the CGI of the face. It just looked wrong...cheap. Similar to the 3rd eye on Doctor Strange. But overall I found the movie to be fun and Kang has the potential to be an excellent new supervillain. It's not in the top 10 Marvel movies but it certainly isn't below 50%. I'd give it a C+/B-. If you're a Marvel fan of any kind it's worth your time."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than Wakanda Forever
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bad movie bad villain bad cgi‚Ä¶ all around terrible
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang was epic. The movie was a wacky, funny and it moved well. The emotional core did not hit as hard as they would have liked. But it was a solid movie overall."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The special effects were amazing and overall plot was top-tier would see the movie again. D box seats were definitely worth it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,That was amazing! Theories of the Quantum realm and how all of our physics change there and time. I think that was perfect and I can't wait for Loki season 2!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I feel disappointed, I didn't get anything from this story, Actually, watch the end credit that is enough."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought the acting from the cast was great as usual, however it felt a little anti climatic considering how strong Kang is. Overall enjoyed it but it did not meet my high expectations"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I seriously don't know why critics these days are so jaded. It's like they want every movie to be citizen cane. It's quantumania going to win Oscars? No. But it's it fun? Hell yes. I loved this movie. But I know that I also really liked Love & Thunder which a lot of people didn't. But I do think this was better than L&T. It was fun but probably my least favorite of the Ant Man movies.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel should stop worrying about the big saga and start telling stories that matter, that have a little heart and that are able to bring some emotion to the viewer."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Most Definitely a fun family movie , as always Marvel proves once again why they‚Äôre movies are the best !!!! üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Just as expected. That‚Äôs a good thing. Entertaining. Could cut some of the never ending fight scenes but that‚Äôs just me. I do love Darren.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I there are some good elements like the relationship between the characters and kang but not enough to hold the entire plot together.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Screw the critics, I really enjoyed the movie, it was very fun, better than Love and Thunder for example.."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was decent movie, pretty much what I expected out of an Ant Man movie. Little more on the darker, more high stakes than the previous movies. Still bits of the Ant Man/Marvel humor in there, but a good introduction to Kang in the movies. A good start to phase 5 in the MCU, looking forward to where they go next in the Multiverse Saga. So I'd recommend giving it a chance."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Like all movies there is always room for improvement. However, I think this new phase of marvel is off to a good start. The movie is very enjoyable "
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Kang was the best thing about the movie.  Jonathan Majors was great in this.  The story was a great setup for the continuing setup for KANG.  I thought the movie was good for what it was.  The weakest part of the movie was the CGI fight scenes.  I would and will see it again, just for the Kang scenes."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a very fun movie, appropriately goofy, and mildly heartfelt. Paul Rudd is so charming, as always. Evangeline Lily was the best she's ever been as Wasp. She truly feels like a superhero in this outing. The new Cassie is fine, still unclear why they needed to recast her. Desperately missing the 3 wombats, especially Luis. 
The Quantum realm is sooo interesting. Comparisons to Star Wars are accurate. I think people are forgetting that Star Wars is similarly goofy if you only watched the first film (A New Hope). 
Kang is a scary, formidable villain. MODOK was fun, and it was a fun callback to an earlier film. People complained about this movie being connected to the others, and... yeah? How would it make sense to disregard everything these characters have been through? And don't most movies in franchises have things that will connect to the rest? I don't agree that this movie is TOO connected to enjoy on its own. The adventure wraps up in one movie. We get the sense that it's over, but we get a mid-credits scene that suggests it isn't, just like any other franchise movie. At any rate, the movie definitely doesn't deserve a rotten rating. It SHOULD be somewhere in the 70s, not the 50s. It's a good movie, not the most life changing, but good. And it leans into the weirdness, which it seems like critics dislike, but comics fans might like."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was decent definitely holds up what the trailer was promoting with an awesome performance by Jonathan Majors as kang the conqueror. A bright future for the MCU which my curiosity and excitement just got a whole lot bigger.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's better than every movie of phase 4, great start of phase 5"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"How did the critics place Thor: Love & Thunder higher than this one? Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania was a good entry into Phase 5, can't wait to see what more they do with Kang! Don't believe the critics on this one and watch for yourself, you won't be disappointed."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, they lost the opportunity to make Ant-man as good as Iron man. Got more cringe than fun moments. That Moddock....awfull."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not a very fun movie with bad cgi. An even further step down than Thor love amd thunder
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,it's good. not ok not great. Paul rudd does a fantastic job as usual. lower your expectations people this isn't an endgame type movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked that the movie was fast-paced (very quick to drop us into the Quantum Realm). Majors is having a great time and adding so much to the character(s) of Kang. I also enjoy the containment of the series (it's fine to just watch the three Ant-Man movies and enjoy the ride of Scott Lang and the Ant-family). Beautiful, interesting, unknown worlds in every backdrop. I wish that Wasp had more to do, especially since the movies are now billed as a duo story; movie just wants to focus on Scott.
It stands alone as an Ant-Man tale, but the mid-credits and post-credit scenes did, of course, get me psyched for future tv and movie projects."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was the weirdest movie marvel has made,they under-utilised MODOK,Jonathan Majors stole the show with his very brilliant and versatile acting.While the CGI in some scenes was really weird,it was still better than most of the phase 4 movies,Overall the movie was good but not the best."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it. Great character development with us seeing more of Janet and Hank. Jonathan Major's intro as Kang was outstanding! A little less humor than expected from the third in this series, but good when it was there. Some solid surprises too. Overall, I enjoyed it and recommend it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved this movie.  It's a mix of Guardians of the Galaxy and Star Wars.  Big departure from
thr first two installments  as this was a sci fi adventure.   Kang was great and the Antman family of characters were all used very well."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great cast, stellar villain, and the quirky Ant-Man humor."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"very very very boring and uninspiring. Disney wins, they have killed Marvel and Star Wars...."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it mind blowing way to start Phase 5 Kang is here
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,No soul whatsoever. Felt like they were just throwing whatever stuck on the screen.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed the film! I am not sure which version the critics watched but I would tell anyone to give it a shot. Is it the best Marvel film? No, I suppose not. But it definitely delivered many heartfelt and action-packed scenes."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entretenida! Sin chistes tontos como Thor 4. Y al fin un villano como la gente, serio y con un objetivo claro. Tiene detalles que no la hacen perfecta pero la ver√≠a nuevamente, algo que no puedo decir de casi ninguna del 2020 en adelante."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Start to finish I was engaged
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great pacing. Excellent plotline. Some fun surprises. Excellent character usage. Had a blast!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," It is a pretty entertaining movie, that is at least better than the second movie. That has way higher reviews than it. Since for one the villain is far superior. The movie just gets sillier lines as it goes on with less of the jokes landing. Also yes the movie isn‚Äôt oozing in originality. The movie is Journey to the Center of Earth meets Tron Legacy, with Ant-Man."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Massive amount of dog dirt please stop
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding Performances all around the board 8.0/10
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,it was an okay movie to set up other movies. if u dont care about swear words than its a good family friendly movie they say d* ck a lot in a scene or two
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sehr gut, der Beginn einer neuen Phase zu sein"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've had enough of Marvel mediocrity. The best movie they made was BP2 only everytime I gave them a chance and they did disappoint everytime.
The movie is just mid or below mid at best the VFX are bad , the story doesn't make sense , the background score is forgettable.
The acting performances were good."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,mcu off to a great start ! loved the action! J majors is fantastic!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have no idea why this movie is getting review-bombed, this was such a fun ride! It's the quantum realm so YES, there will be new direction, scenes and characters to explore but it's such a great way to introduce the vast different world of the MCU. It's not a ""perfect"" movie but it sure ain't no way a bad movie either. I thought it was a blast and there never really was a dull moment in it such as, ""can we get to the good stuff?"" BE YOUR OWN CRITIC, watch the movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie Jonathan Majors stole the show‚Äô can‚Äôt wait to see more of him in upcoming Marvel projects.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I really loved the movie as a whole. Felt a bit short and Wasp didn't have enough screen time. Also more Kang was needed. Overall It was one of the best Marvel Movie and Phase 5 Started pretty well.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it. It had a little bit of everything. Comedy, action and drama. I enjoyed seeing it in 3D."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,6/10. Wasn't that great. Was really just a fill-in to show how powerful Kang is and how he's going to be a thanos level villain. Could've just watch a summary and still understood.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie. Kang was incredible and modok actually works üëç
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I believe that the less than good reviews about this movie are due to an unrealistic expectation that each movie will match that of Endgame. I enjoyed this movie for what it was despite some questionable writing and choices made towards the end. All in all, I look forward to the levity Majors brings to his role and the future of Kang."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was ok but its literally a copy of the storyline from star wars 4 and a copy of any other ant man movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a fun enjoyable ride into the Quantum Realm. They hint at where they are going with already announced movies with subtle little comments early on. My primary negative takeaway in my initial watching is that for somereason, Reed just had to do a villain redemption arc. Bad guys need to stay bad guys, period. If in the source material, there was a redemption arc, Then so be it, but no need to create one where one does not exist. The visula effects were so much better than what most of phase 4 was, which I hold as promising for the future movies now that Chapak is gone. 
All in all, this is a Decent enough kickoff to phase 5 and introduction into the characters and story going forward."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,great story for the next phase....kang was awesome....mid and post credit scene üëÄ
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"screw the haters, of course, it's not the same as what MCU used to be but that doesn't mean it's garbage come on you guys! where is your sense of adventure 
Jonathan Majors's performance is mind-blowing his character arc started slow but he killed it he was scary in the end! it's a thrilling roller coaster ride that you don't want the essential movie to be missed although I have to admit it's the best but is a popcorn-worthy movie so you feel that your money is not wasted! well for me of course!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mais um filme med√≠ocre do universo marvel, fica vis√≠vel a falta de investimento nos efeitos especiais e roteiro seguindo o fracasso da fase 4 do MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Had a good time with my siblings
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Solo se salva por kang, solo hay cliches, totalmente predecible, agujeros de guion en cada segundo, un modok arruinado, efectos especiales deficientes, un ant man idiotizado ademas de que ya lo estan haciendo prescindible para la nueva generaci√≥n pol√≠ticamente correcta, eliminando a todos los vengadores antiguos y sustituyendo con sus contrapartes que no tuvieron exito ni en comics ni en animaciones, como se suele decir, Marvel UCM Murio en EndGame, solo queda el Marvel de Sony, y ver como manejan la parte de FOX con Deadpool y 4 Fantasticos"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Paul Rudd as Ant Man is always a joy to watch, and Kang is a good villain, his introduction works. The comedy is the right amount and they cracked me a laugh. Everything else is a mess. Montage is horrible, they jump from one scene to another with clearly something missing in the middle. Not one character has an arc, everyone is just there, going left and right without any personal motivation. Except probably for MODOK, which is the worst thing I ever seen on a Marvel movie, absolutely embarrassing. And on that note, the worst thing is the CGI. In a lot of moments you can clearly see that they are actors in front of a green screen with no clue on what's happening, especially for Michael Douglass. He's like Guillermo in Jimmy Kimmel Live when he's put on a movie for a joke. 
Marvel has clearly lost its vision, its capability to put crazy stuff in a believable context. They managed to make Ego the living planet and made it work. Seems like they can't do it anymore. Paul Rudd and Johnathan Majors somehow saved this movie and made it fun to see, but Marvel needs to change writers as soon as possible. I gave it 3 stars because in the end it's an Ant Man movie, good for bringing your kids to the movies, but if they make Avengers Kang Dynasty with those writers it will be very hard to watch"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie itself is fine although it did seem like I was watching a Star Wars rip off at times. The saving grace of this film is Jonathan Majors as Kang. As the kids nowadays say ""he is him."""
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall I felt this was a good movie but there were spots the plot/acting was forced and awkward.  My son and I did like the integrations with the Marvel productions including the Loki series.  We will watch again, but will wait until this one comes out on Disney+ instead of another theater run."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bad start for phase 5. This movie is just bad.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good start to start phase 5 but it doesn't feel like a antman movie more of a setup for future films. Here is my 1 minute spoilers free review
https://youtube.com/shorts/wvPNsM6O-EY?feature=share"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme √© muito bom, leve, descontra√≠do e atende ao universo cinematogr√°fico da Marvel."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Went with my 6 year old son it was fantastic and a great ode to family's sticking together!! A few wonky cgi moments but pur maverick fun!!! Everyone needs to remember this is a Marvel Movie and not some epic biopic trying to win a Oscar. Just alot of fun and a great way to lead into phase 5!!!! Kang is an absolute beast!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have seen others who have not liked it as much as me and that is understandable. I preferred the setup and for the coming years this will be remembered. Overall I would go see it again. Watch Loki before and it connects, by my appeal. It was worth it and deserves."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it so much. its good start of phase 5. i recommend to watch it. Kang is unbelievable. Paul is perfect as always.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Family friendly entertainment. Becoming more of a rarity with Marvel. But the storyline and pacing just didn't grab me as much as the old ones.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Made for 3D!!! A spectacular show.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The storyline seemed to drag, and it didn‚Äôt make sense. Big fan of marvel, but not a fan of this one"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,i love it nice start to phase  five
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Genuinely enjoyed the film, I noticed 1 or 2 plot holes but inevitably sometimes these things can happen when in a massive franchise. Looking forward to the future and hope to get a proper cap to ant-mans story this just felt like a continuation to his story  rather than an end"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was really great! Saw it in 3D IMAX with Dolby Atmos, it was an amazing experience."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"while there are some things in this movie we have seen before in past marvel movies, antman and the wasp: quantimania definitely brought something new to the mcu and i really enjoyed it. i can't wait for the future of the mcu"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme muito ruim e confuso, al√©m de gerar um enorme desconforto audiovisual"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best Marvel movies I've seen! Easily one of my top 10 favorite MCU movies! Way better than anything in Phase 4 (except No Way Home of course). Marvel is back to form with this one! It's funny, it's action packed, it's visually impressive, it drives the whole MCU plot forward. There's also great messages about the importance of family throughout. Just a great movie and a great start to Phase 5! Stick around for both end credit scenes as they both also drive the MCU plot forward and aren't just filler jokes for the heck of it. Awesome movie!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't know why it got rotten. It doesn't deserve to be rotten
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a great start to phase 5.  Kang is a menacing villain and an overall great film. there are some pros and con's though throughout the movie.
Pros: Kang gets a backstory on how he is trapped in the quantum realm and really focus on him being a great and menacing villain. The world building on this is also great it shows an alternet universe ready to be doscovered. This movie knows how to balance seriousness and jokes throughout the movie.
Con's: Modok was wasted. They made him into a weapon and killed him off in one of the worst ways possible. Scotts and Cassie's relationship hasn't been looked into that much and it focused on world building a lot. CGI has some choppy moments. The first act was hard to sit through due to nothing much happening. And fibally, for a movie about antman and the wasp  we barely see the wasp at all. 
But overall this movie is a must go see if you want to see kang and his back story and how he was banished but if you want to see scott and his installment into the third triology then I'd still recommend but to not get your hopes up. I fairly enjoyed this movie but its gonna be a mixed reaction. between many people."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,wth have they done to my boys Antman and Kang?
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Roteiro p√©ssimo cheio de furos e conveni√™ncias
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"After reading through the ""official movie reviews"", I've come to a realization they are stupid. This movie was fun from start to finish. Kang was awesome, can't wait to see what's next."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie was very solid and an enjoyable watch. People are over exaggerating when they say the movie is a disaster. The movie could have been longer and the cassie‚Äôs character could have been written better. But overall very enjoyable movie to watch, cgi was pretty good and kang was a menace."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie. Classic antman/Paul Rudd humor and action. 

The old lady had too many lines/screen time and kang is a flop imo. Still worth seeing for antman/modok/the jelly
Guy üòÇ"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was very fun! Kang was great! The timing of the humor is well done. It‚Äôs very different from the other two movies. I really don‚Äôt understand why the critics hate this movie. I can‚Äôt wait to see how the Kang Dynasty story progresses!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang steals every scene he is in.  Great and fun movie overall!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. I loved the build up to how menacing Kang was and then having it actually come through when we meet him. Loved seeing how much the ant man family all love each other. No notes. Felt like Star Wars which then reminded me of Andor.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the sci Fi element to this and Kang is amazing!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was super fun. It feels like a return to pre-phase four MCU, that had an opinion on the direction that it wanted to go in. Critic reviews are showing just how inept they are at understanding why people watch comic book movies: they're stupid, fun, and good hearted! This movie hit all three criteria perfectly. Would watch again¬†‚Äì which is about the highest compliment I can give a comic book movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it all. Especially the holes.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The beginning of the movie is not very good, and neither are the middle and end. Not even the 5-star performance of Jonathan Majors manages to save the movie (or Kang) from the abysmal script. The overused storytelling tool employed here = ""I have not told you something for no good reason and that is why we are in trouble right now"", is one that should be left in the shed for the rest of the 21st century. The final fight sequence and ending left me speechless - in a bad way."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Based on the poor ""pro"" reviews, my expectations dropped a bit for this movie.  That might have helped in the end though as I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I feel like the reviews are off base and wonder if they even saw the same movie that I did.  Many mention the lack of action.  There is plenty of it and the last 30 minutes or so is all action.  Paul Rudd is his charming self and has some comedy thrown in that sticks the landing or fall flat.  I miss Michael Pena though and felt he should have been included for at least a few minutes.  Michelle Pfeiffer does a LOT in this movie.  She could have been listed as the lead for the most part.  Jonathan Majors' Kang is just as good that he was in Loki.  This Ant-Man movie seems a little late to the party, but it is in the MCU to setup Kang as the big bad for Phase 5.  As for cons, I did have a few issues with it.  The entire movie except for 15 minutes or so takes place in the Quantum Realm.  Good or bad, that means it relies heavily on special effects for background and atmosphere.  I thought the effects looked really good in parts, and bad in others.  The character Modak kind of makes sense in the story, but he looks totally ridiculous and has like the worst gag that falls flat at the end.  Overall, I was happy with the movie.  Is it as good as Phases 1 thru 3?  No, but not much will be for a long time.  Recommend you see it once in theaters."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was absolutely amazing, Jonathan Major was epicly performed kang. And best post credit in Marvel Histroy."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang is an awesome villain. His motivations are completely clear from the start. I'm not going to spoil anything but you have to stick around for the post credit scene. The movie itself was ok but Kang carried the whole film.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went into the theater with low expectations due to Marvel's past blunders and wokeness in Phase 4. I came away surprised and pleased with the story and the visuals. The movie is NOT woke, not in the least. No f-words either.
Very nice emphasis was placed on FAMILY and we need more of that.
The colorful and intricate visuals seemed to outshine Avatar and the large palette of different and freaky characters in this sub-atomic universe made for a visual feast. Better than Star Wars!
Great action and great acting with all of the main actors getting equal time to shine. At least two plot twists. One or two of the jokes were cringe and there was one instance of TMI of a personal type.
A very good starter to Phase 5 and a good set up for what is to come. It was an adventure, a bizarre road trip of sorts. Btw not all screens are equal and I was fortunate to see it on a great theater screen with exceptionally vivid colors and very good detail.
MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I did find this movie entertaining. My issue is this, the entire movie is nearly completely CGI and reminded me a ton of the movie ""Sharkboy and Lava Girl"" mixed with ""Spy Kids 3."" Overall, this would have made for good video game cut scenes, but Hollywood movie magic is dead."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie. Definitely the best ant man movie out of the 3. The quantum realm is amazing ! I loved the story and visual effects.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie made no sense. The pacing is bad. The story hinges on tropes like characters not communicating extremely important information to each other. The cg looked bad. The Kang we got from Loki was much better. 

So disappointing"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it but Kang was very weak in my opinion
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Rotten tomatoes once again showing us the critics have it backwards from comic book fans
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was great, had good action sequences and good storytelling. Heard it was written by a Rick and Morty writer, and if it is true, it definitely shows. The previous 2 Ant-Man's were 'ok' in my book, but this third attempt out is definitely rememberable. Taking a spot amongst one of my favorite MCU films."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and awesome vfx. Decent plot and super rich looking quantum world. Good start to the dynasty series.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Just a good Marvel film. Not an epic like Endgame or as Oscar worthy as Wakanda Forever. But not every Marvel film needs to be. Very enjoyable!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie to see in cinemas while you can, Kang is epic!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Johnathan Majors knocks out of the park as Kang. There is a weight to his performance and he is very intimidating. His performance plus the usual Paul Rudd charm are just about the only saving graces for the movie, which feels to large-scale for an Ant-Man movie, but to small-scale for anything else. The dramatic ""I can't tell you in order to keep you safe"" troupe is pervasive throughout the movie and creates false tension. The humor is often cringe-inducing, but when it is funny it often finds itself undercutting the tone at the time. Cassie's character, whether it be the casting, the writing, or a combination of the two, is bland and uninteresting. Bill Murray's role was wasted and M.O.D.O.K's inclusion felt forced, as if they didn't have anything for the character to do but needed the requisite MCU movie cameo. During the thoroughly confusing end of the movie, it's apparent that the main characters did not grow, change, or develop in any way throughout the entire movie. It feels as if they could have skipped making this movie without any consequence to the characters or overarching story."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great Marvel movie
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"They take a character whose powers are mostly appealing in contrast to real life things and put him in a fictional world where it's just less fun and the creators can't be as imaginative.
They tried to make a science-fiction epic, but didn't take the proper time to set up this new world. It feels flat and unoriginal. Kang saved the movie tho, I'm exited for his future past and present."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun characters in peril, solid MCU entry, with Pfieffer and Majors stealing the show."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quite an adventure to start Marvel's phase five, villain far above average."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was alright. Definitely nothing great about it. Even the 2 extra scenes were basic. Ant-Man is the ""Little Guy"" in the MCU and he proves it in this movie. If they showed what Kang did leading up to the plot it could've boosted up this movie but sadly they only talked about what he did. His powers were good but we're definitely limited to not overpower Ant-Man and Wasp."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good, better than a lot of what the early reviews were saying. I was pulled in right from the first act and then some. Yeah, it's not perfect, it has some 'things' here and there that could be better, but that's with every movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie was so much fun! people just have a stick up their ass.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,How could any marvel fan not love this film? The setup for phase 5 was well done! The action and quantum realm was another universe entirely. I‚Äôm wondering where the % will be after the weekend.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Although, there were some hiccups, overall it was a good movie that expanded on the future foundation of the marvel multiverse."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure why the critics are so harsh on this one - the visuals were absolutely amazing, acting was great, action-packed, and storyline was good especially if you've been closely following the MCU multiverse shows/movies and have some historical comic knowledge of Kang the Conqueror."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film, rotten tomatoes doesnt know how to rate movies"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was really enjoyable and truly sets up whats to come for the MCU!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie takes a significant step away from what the franchise has been so far, the look is there, but i does not stick the landing. Having the entire Ant family come back for this seems forced and the movie fumbles to have things for everyone to do. This means good additions like Cassie and Kang is left with little screen time and no character development. Meanwhile every other character introduced is only serving as jokes or canon fodder for the inevitable and pointless big 3rd act battle. Some might say this is every marvel movie but i disagree, except for this one."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great start of Phase 5. Didn't feel like an Ant-Man movie but I loved it anyways. Loved that they changed Modok from the comics to this movie. Jonathan Majors is Kang and Paul Rudd is Ant-man. Absolutely worth watching.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the early negativity! This movie was a great MCU installment. The stakes felt high, and they were, and the light hearted comedy that is a staple of the MCU / Paul Rudd did not take away from the more serious moments of the film. Kang is that dude!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this was a great way to bring Kang into the MCU. If they had just thrown him out there would have been hard to follow but the backstory here opened up the rest of the MCU. Visuals and story were well done and the humor was well placed.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I like it. It's as marvels universe works!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie Was great, I had a good time."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun good ride of a movie. Lots to enjoy.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent addition to the MCU with the further introduction of Kang. Funny and entertaining!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a rough watch, Michelle Pfiefer was the only redeeming character in the film. Overstuffed, with questionable CGI, no real stakes, and monologue after monologue from Kang(Majors) that meant and went nowhere, who should have given much better material to work with.  I love the cast, but overall disappointed in the execution of the film."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"great characters, good humor, I enjoyed the movie, and amazing world building"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a complete disaster. Visually, it's hideous. The story is a mess with no sense of structure or pacing. There's zero weight behind anything. Cast is all flat. Couldn't care less about the future of the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun, excellent special effects but a little slow in the development of the story"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really don't mean to come off rude, but this movie was painful to watch. The acting was terrible, the CGI was lazy, the plot line was an underwhelming and tired one. I had to close my eyes a couple of times through the movie because Marvel's way of using humor to release the tension of a scene is unbearable at this point.
I watched this because I like Paul Rudd, and in the end, he was the movie's saving grace.
I hope this can help someone out there."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Do not ever trust press reviews, this movie may be not perfect but I had a very good moment watching the story of Scott and everyone. Kang is absolutely amazing !"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I‚Äôm not sure what the critics went in expecting so badly and didn‚Äôt see, but I thought this movie was a lot of fun."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Really enjoyed the story, the action, the comedy, the acting, overall excellent movie!!! Critics have no idea!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Did you like the previous two movies? If you did then you'll love this one with a fun blend of humor and sci-fi scares that doesn't reinvent the wheel but feels more ambitious than the second in the series. The MCU has it's first family hero movie before it tries to conquer The Fantastic Four- having failed twice before this movie sets up the new big bad with a little more rounding than Loki could. The cast brings a sense of solid skill to what could easily be a silly movie without the care shown here. Marvel would be wise to steer back toward serious drama though to avoid the universe becoming overly populated with characters derived for the sake of comedy.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it. I thought it was better then what the critics have been saying about it, thought it was a nice start to phase 5. Was better then all the phase 4 movies except for spiderman no way home. Visually beautiful movie. Kang was amazing and can't wait to see more of him in the rest of phase 5 and things too come..go see this movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-man and the Wasp is a series of plot contrivances, plot holes, poor-to-cringe dialogue and Spy Kids level cgi. I am truly shocked that people are trying to defend this with a straight face. What a waste of a decent cast."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visual effects were stunning, length was perfect, comedy was great! It's a good ol' fashioned super hero movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man 3 wastes no time taking the Ant-Family back to the Quantum Realm. Well paced with great set up and terrific performances from Jonathan Majors. Loved the MODOK adaptation and the comedy felt just right. The movie was fun from start-to-finish. Michael Douglas and Jonathan Majors are total standouts. This Kang easily stands out next to He Who Remains, and the Council of Kang teased so much more with the character. The tying of incursions, variants, the scale of wider multiverse, all the new jargon we picked up Phase 4, all of this was great and just what I wanted more out of Phase 5.

There's genuinely hardly anything to pick at the way something like Thor L&T is. It's very much by the numbers as all MCU films are, and it could've maybe upped the stakes a bit more with a major sacrifice, but it's clear we're still very early into Kang story, and the tease at the end was a great post-credits at what's to come."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed the movie, the visually effects were great as-well as the cinematography. Really fun and enjoyable with a fantastic villain in Johnathan Major's Kang. Paul Rudd is great again as Ant-Man. The film isn't a masterpiece of cinema but definitely keeps to the mcu feelings and overall tone. Great start to phase 5"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's not great, but it's not bad either. A little overloaded but still solid fun."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A great movie highly recommended for any fan.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a very good movie! Much better than I heard from the reviews. I‚Äôm happy Marvel is back on track! LET‚ÄôS GOOOOO!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics couldn't be more wrong about this movie. It was great and a must see for MCU fans.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed Quantumania. It was very different from the first two Ant Man movies, which I think hit many critics wrong. It's a much bigger, more sci-fi story, which means a lot more special effects and CGI.  If you like Marvel movies, you'll probably love this."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,There were a lot of fun moments that made this movie enjoyable. Overall it was a messy plot that was carried by fun performances by its lead actors.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie. The visuals were stunning, cgi was fantastic and the acting was ht top knotch. Granted it was a little jokey but just the right amount . Movie goers expect
a little humor as the franchise was based on mocking the hero. check out live reaction

"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good story and great CGI. Enjoyable experience.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"There are times when you really have to wonder if some film critics have any joy at all in their lives. Definitely a larger scale for the Antman franchise, messy at times indeed, but overall it's an enjoyable watch, I found it far more entertaining than most of the disappointing entries in Phase 4."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Probably the worst marvel movie I've ever watched at least with most of phase four I still enjoyed watching the tv series or movies. With this movie it almost made me fall asleep with the lackluster humor and absolutely terrible storyline, as a movie that was supposed to set up a major villain for the next couple years I've never been more let down by the ending of this movie as it builds barely any suspense and truly feels bad watching the whole plot unfold."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty movie. Great entertainment for everyone.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man Quantumania is a good movie. Enough action and humor to keep things moving. Jonathan Majors steals the show to be sure. The Quantum Universe is rich and beautiful, lots of Star Wars Cantina vibes. Def needs to be seen on big screen & 3D. It totally sets up the ""big bad"" for Phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I seriously don't get the hate. It was a really fun movie. Jonathan Majors as Kang is probably the best part. Paul Rudd did great, and Michelle Pffifer really got her time to shine. It was really fun and a great start to Marvel Phase 5. My only complaints are M.O.D.O.K could've been better and Wasp could've had more time. But besides that, this was a good movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is the best of the 3 Antman movies. It has its faults, but it is entertaining, and they present you with a villain that will give you a lot to talk about."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"worst movie of the decades, MCU DEAD AT AVENGERS END GAME"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was stupid
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I actually liked it. I don't understand the rotten score? Black Adam, now that was a bad movie, this one is far better compared to it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's antman's smallest and yet; biggest adventure yet, story is straight forward and if you've been watching the storyline following Kang, you won't be disappointed."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best marvel move to come out since the end of Phase 3. The only phase 4 movie I really liked was multiverse of madness.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Eh, its alright. Not really the best start for the supposed phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A movie every marvel fan was waiting for, things got really serious this time. Jonathan majors shine as kang the conqueror, visual graphics were spot-on and story was so awesome and well written"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie makes you miss the Infinite saga so much
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Amo las pel√≠culas de Marvel y disfruto cualquier entrega como si fuera un ni√±o peque√±o no me gusta criticar Marvel solo dir√© que falt√≥ un poco de desarrollo del personaje de Kang y una mejor introducci√≥n a la fase
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Idk why critics would review it as a bad film. I enjoyed it thoroughly till the end without getting bored. This movie is definitely better than Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The writing is a mess, the directing is nothing to be proud of either, the overall acting is only on a tolerable level, and the CGI looks really cheap. Just do yourself a favor and watch something else."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good - don't believe all the bad vibes
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't let the critics sway you.   Quantumania is a perfectly fun, serviceable super hero film with an enjoyable main cast, smaller (hah) stakes than a movie like Civil War or Endgame, and one fantastic turn as the antagonist Kang by Jonathan Majors.  Its visually fun and weird, even though we've definitely seen things similar to this already from Strange World and Avatar, but its still a fun romp through the Quantum Realm and introduces us to interesting, if not forgettable, side characters.  Sadly, there is no Luis, so unfortunately, the movie will never be perfect."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,So incredible. You need watch this
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun graphics that make the world seem amazing. The story is decent, but the actors make this a fun movie. It's Ant-man. I'm not going to the movie looking for an Academy Award. It's fun. It's what I expect from Marvel movies. If you like the genre, it's a good movie to go see."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you want an honest review, here it is. It just really doesn‚Äôt hit like the oldies. And specifically, this movie did not contain any of the original charm of the other ant-man movies. Humor fell flat almost every time, I think the audience gave a gentle courtesy laugh about 3 times the whole movie (including a joke at the end with MODOK that the writers must‚Äôve thought they were the funniest people on the planet‚Ä¶ everyone in the audience just kinda looked at each other and rolled their eyes). And if you were hopeful that Luis would be there to say something funny, you‚Äôll be disappointed to hear you never see him once. Many of the lines were cheesy and did not propel the plot. Strong violations of the ‚Äúshow don‚Äôt tell‚Äù principle. In the first 45-60 minutes, there are multiple sequences of characters just sitting and talking with empty, one-line fillers to explain away major plot holes. Kang and his mission could have been a lot scarier, but honestly I didn‚Äôt really care whether or not he destroyed everything because they didn‚Äôt set up the stakes well at all. Bill Murray was a waste of the film‚Äôs budget for the role they gave him. It almost seemed like they were relying SO heavily on the visual effects in the film, that they thought the audience would just be amazed regardless of the flat acting and bad storytelling (and trust me, Evangeline Lilly is one of my fav actresses, but because of the script she was given, there wasn‚Äôt much to work with). At the end, no one clapped. Multiple people just kinda looked around with bored faces and said things like ‚Äúwelp, that was a movie‚Äù or ‚Äúyeah that was really disappointing‚Äù. I would give it a 3/10. It‚Äôs not a 1 because at least they gave some wishy-washy descriptions of what the future of marvel will look like, so maybe there‚Äôs hope for something. Overall, yeah it was a major yikes and a disappointing unfunny plot-hole filled film."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ants canonically control the quantum verse
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a Paul Rudd movie.  It did not feature enough of his comedy but it was a veichle for him. It was a fun ride.  And like any ride, you do not need to understand all the physics of it.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.  End credits setup what you need to know about Phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is absolutely incredible! Especially I love Scotts daughter Cassie who's in the action as Stature! Wow I absolutely love her outfit and fighting skills should work a bit she's amazing!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"mid movie, I don't know if ant man was the hero for kang's presentation, the best part is Kang and modock is a disappointment"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nothing original here. A strictly by-the-numbers, boring, terrible CGI-fest. Not even worth seeing as an MCU fan."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good, not great.  Needed some better writing and shtick for Bill Murray, who was more underutilized than Jeff Goldblum in that abysmal Jurassic World final√©.  You can tell Marvel was trying to recreate some Goldblum in ""Ragnarok"" magic, but they'd need a lot more scenes and better directing /writing for that.  There was something META about the story for me, knowing Kang will go on to cause a lot of chaos in the MCU - something about the final battle REALLY had me rooting for the good guys, more so than usual.  As if I knew what was at stake.  While I enjoyed the film, I would've given Marvel fans what they've been begging for for a while... some interconnected tissue between films.  Quantumania felt like the first big movie to stir up enough MCU commotion to get the attention of the Avengers, but nope... just yet another standalone movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was very entertaining. Jonathan Majors does a great job!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Brilliant - Do not listen to the critics. It is worth a watch. Bit messy at the end but the first hour and half of the movie was really cool and very much like star-wars themed. I really enjoyed it to be honest.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,confusing tone but I'll allow it
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just watched, left the cinema with a broken üíî heart, it just feels like a recycled movie. Miss üíê the good old marvel movies. Welp like injustice joker üÉè says  "" so big yet so dumb "" literally 4 all the characters in Antman 3. Marvel is no longer the one that I use to hype n enjoy. Haizz ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§ß"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this chapter of the Marvel saga. While I did find some parts a bit too convenient, and some of the humor didn't land with me. Overall, I did enjoy my two hours in the movie theater."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Plot not fully exposed.  Needed more time or simple plot.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Maybe the bad critic reviews braced me for this movie and made me like it a little more‚Ä¶ but I don't think this deserves the (current) 46% from critics. I also don't think it deserves to be a 90% movie. 

It follows sort of a bell curve‚Ä¶ starts weak, gets very strong and hits its height in the middle, then ends weak with a couple of bounces. Had the 3rd act been strong, it would've been an easy 90%+. 

Anyways, comedy falls flat mostly. I liked Jonathan Majors a lot more here than in Loki. But I still feel like his acting style and line delivery is sort of cheesy. Mid-credit (or post, can't remember) just kind of showed to me that he doesn't really have the range needed to play this role. Regardless, when he's good he's great. 

I really wanted to like this one, and maybe that's why I did. I just didn't love it. Thankfully, they made enough good decisions to balance out the plethora of bad ones‚Ä¶. And it sort of balances out. Just doesn't make a strong movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was good and sets the future for Kang the Conqueror in the MCU!!!! And people watch the movie if you want too don't let other people opinions stop you I don't care what the critics say this movie was awesome all around
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The story is good but not great. It's a great set up for the future of the MCU. The visuals and CGI are just out of this world! Jonathan Majors stole the show with his performance! It's a great and must see marvel movie!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's not the best of the trilogy (I prefer the second movie that still my favorite of the three), but 'Quantumania' is a adventure full of action that could be so much more, but the script never helps the movie be more that it can be, but with solid performances of Paul Rudd, Michelle Pffeifer and of course Jonathan Majors that still the show, this flick provide some good emotional moments. I think Peyton Reed did a good job to finish the trilogy and point an interesting future to the phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I laughed, I cried. I fell even more in love with Rudd. Really delivering on the climactic ending, this one was good from start to finish!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"La estructura de la peli a mi criterio est√° muy bien. Tiene momentos de comedia que creo, todos esperamos. En general me entretuvo y gust√≥ mucho"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this movie, and it did have a lot of enjoyable moments. The majority of the cast is fantastic, especially Rudd and Majors.

Recasting the actress who played Cassie in Endgame without giving her any notice, and then Kathryn Newton was literally the worst part of the movie. Falling for the ""I'm an annoying teenager who's going to make a million stupid mistakes"" trope.

Also, the mid-credit scene really makes Kang look like a frat-boy idiot which is very uncharacteristic of the villain we see throughout the film. 

Overall, I think the movie is fine, but could have been so so much better. Stop hiring cartoon writers for blockbuster films and stop cheaping out so horribly on CGI.

There's a particular scene with Scott and Cassie fighting, and the CGI of the shrinking/growing and running is incredibly awful. MODOK? Oh my goodness

Marvel, do better‚Ä¶"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I seriously don't know what on earth kind of hallucinogens are the ""critics"" on, but the movie is superb. Yeah, it is not a masterpiece, but it is one of the most enjoyable movies, not just MCU, I have seen. From intro scene to post-credit scene there was no filler, no drop in interest and no fatigue on the actor's playing. A spectacular and highly imaginative portrayal of the quantum realm, colorful characters, a scaling up story and a great setting-up for the multiverse saga's true beginning. Yes, the plot was not some intriguing twists-'n'-turns story, but it was adequate for an entertaining movie with above average qualities. If I was some technicalities driven, absurdly artsy, strict professional critit, I would be ashamed to put something less than a 70%. It is defintely above 80% for any action and/or comics enthusiast."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was pretty good, Jonthan did a good job of making kang seem like a real threat. I like the family strength through out the movie and unity amongst community.The other characters were really charming and nice addition towards the movie. Although Modak felt eh...his death was random and weird but  I will definitely watch again."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Serious tone for a serious villain, Johnathan Majors steals the show as Kang. Setting up the future for the MCU, and developing Scott and Cassie Lang's characters to being more then just the comic relief. Solid 8.5/10"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a great movie. I love how they mix in a good balance of humor!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not as funny as the first 2 antman movies but isn't really trying to be. Fun movie that really brings the comics to life and jonathan majors performance as kang is impeccable
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Though it has some flaws still I liked it. it's way much better than Thor love and thunder.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought the movie was pretty good. Disappointed in M.O.D.O.K and some of the jokes just went on for too long or missed completely. Jonathan Majors was fantastic as always and Michelle Pfeiffer was stunning. Overall, good movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the homage to different scifi properties, and it had just enough humor without ruining how serious Kang needs to be. Scott was a delight as usual, and I liked how Janet got an expanded role in this one. Michael Pe√±a was sorely missed though!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A great celebration of holes.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me gusto, un poco floja al inicio, pero mejora despues de los primeros 20 minutos."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me gusto mucho, es entretenida y no se hace larga cada personaje brilla con su interpretaci√≥n y su personaje.
Sin duda para calentar de lo que se avecina est√° genial"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I read the critics reviews on here and just cant wrap my brain around all the hate for this film.  They say nothing works, the characters aren't developed, the jokes don't land‚Ä¶ Then i go to the theater and the crowd laughs at the jokes, cheers for the action, has a general great time! So I scratch my head as to why a film like this gets so slammed. These films bring joy, escapism and fun into peoples lives. They have a place in cinema. Critics eviscerating them just sound elitist in their critiques.  Look is it the best film ever? Of course not‚Ä¶ but is it a really fun popcorn flick with humor, amazing action, set design and some stellar performances? (Jonathan Majors totally slays as Kang in this) Yes, yes it is. So my 2 cents is go see the film and judge for yourself."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't understand how the critics are attaching so much negativity and bad reviews with this movie. It's by far one of the better Marvel movies of late. Jonathan Majors is ridiculously amazing in this movie as Kang. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had a really fun time with this film. It wasn't deep or game-changing, just fun. Jonathan Major's pulled off the role of Kang flawlessly and the action was epic"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Modok funny big head, movie in general funny, good acting by jonathon, ant man funny"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyable film. Not every movie can have the payoff as Endgame or Infinity War because these movies are not the end of a thirteen year journey. They're setup films. Fantastic film for that part. Kang is awesome. Jonathan Majors, to no surprise at all, is the highlight."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I feel like it was very similar to x-men 3 in many ways. And I'm noticing ways in which all mcu films are going and a certain 'formula' or set of rules that is really making the films suffer. I enjoyed some isolated moments, but as a whole, the film was trash. This may be my last mcu cinema experience."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Una pelicula del monton para abajo, llena de comedia sin sentido, marvel estudios perdio su camino, es mas hace ya tiempo que lo perdieron, y aun siguen."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ignore the Critics and Just Have FUN! This movie is great and ton of fun. It's become to trend for critics to turn their noses up at every marvel that has been released since endgame. Ant-Man 3 is not endgame will never on that scale, it is what it is another small marvel movie like the other ant-man movies have been. It is a fun movie with amazing characters and Paul Rudd is great again as ant-man and Kang is awesome. Only negative thing is their is no Luis recapping the story."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not a perfect movie, but visually stunning and very entertaining with humor that was right up my alley at least can't wait to see it again"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Antman Quantomania is an offense to fans, to say that the movie is good is to be complacent. Antman's films have only gone from bad to worse. I really like the first movie, the second one is terrible, and without fear I tell you that this third installment is worse than the second. MODOK is horrifying, not in a good way, and his bad jokes affect Kang. Kang is the best part of the movie, but unfortunately, he's trapped in a soporific script, a story that stretches too much."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fabulous!  Incredible CGI.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are insane, this movie was very entertaining, the world building in the quantum realm is some of the coolest visuals in the MCU, Kang and Janet VD are top tier. Is it perfect, no (some parts are flat out weird)... Is it a top 10 MCU film, no... But it's favorite Ant Man movie of the 3, and absolutely worth seeing in the theaters."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"not the best but neither the worst, close some things and a sneak peek of what's coming into mcu.
Action, jokes, action, superponer, and crazy conversations as paul rudd knows how to deliver us.
A marvel movie That leave me with a smile for what happened and what is coming."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,The MCU is officially dead!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really solid movie, has humor that landed, embraces the goofy potential of the quantum realm, and lots of fun hidden connections to other Marvel projects. I love that each Ant Man/Ant Man and the Wasp movie is different, my favorite Marvel trilogy! I would've loved to have 10 more minutes with Kangs history but this is just the beginning."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors in conjunction with the original Ant-man cast make this movie a pleasure to watch. 

Serious acting chops by Majors that leaves the audience tense and wondering what's about to unfold."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Better than phase 4 movies. CGI still was eh? But the overall movie was really f'n good and even excited me. Previous Phase 4 movies were lacklustre and left me disappointed considering my expectations were at a level where I was waiting for new character introductions and whatnot. There are the obvious cringe lines but I brought my mom who never watches movies, and she had a good laugh. Paul Rudd is hot too."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely one of the best marvel movies to date!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great introduction to Kang The Conqueror. Yes, it was out there and at times outrageous, but I expected exactly that. The pacing, the story, the action, and the setup of the future of the MCU all had me on cloud nine. Just a downright fun experience that will likely be even better on rewatch once more of the future of the MCU has played out."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I did not connect to the story line or drama. The special effects were ok, but we felt like we were watching a Star Wars movie (not as good). I wish I would have waited for this one to come out on video."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is really entertaining. Kang is outta this world. Honestly this is more a Kang movie than anything else. The VFX need to get better, at the beginning they seem really sloppy but got better as the movie went on. A must watch for any MCU fan."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"3.5 stars. There's absolutely nothing wrong with the latest Ant-Man. It's a fun ride from beginning to end. If it has any flaws, it's that it never really does anything truly new or extraordinary, and it's true the stakes feel somewhat low because we know that Kang will lose this round with more Kangs coming round the corner. Perhaps the stakes could have felt heavier with more background about this film's Kang, but nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie and would perhaps even watch it again."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are dead wrong this was a great movie. Great mix of action, storytelling, and a pinch of comedy."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pel√≠cula cumple con su funci√≥n que es dejar las bases para las siguientes pel√≠culas,no es una pel√≠cula espectacular ni sobresaliente aparte de la actuaci√≥n de Kang, pero si es una pel√≠cula entretenida, divertida y que vale la pena ver."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very excited to see where the movie was going the entire time only to be let down over and over again. However, I did love Kang and am curious to see where Marvel is going."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Man, what an amazing movie that was! Many critics were thrashing it.. it depends on who's watching. This is important for MCU. Post credits super"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I wonder how the critics can give such bullshit ratings to this movie . Even though it is not great movie but atleast it's not also the worst . This is a fine movie that have some lows but these critics are showing hatred to MCU . Should be banned. Talking about the movie overall it gives entertainment to the audience and also have some nice jokes as well as many serious moments . Jonathan Major is born to play KANG man üî•. Two credits are of top class. The CGI sometime lacks which should be improved during it's OTT release. 
Overall good start to begin a great multiversal Saga."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie sets the ground for the immense battle that will come for the next group(s) of superheros. Kang is amazing villain and Jonathan majors made his character very believable and comes off as an even bigger threat than Thanos which I knew marvel had that as a giant task in which I had doubts but I no longer do
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun movie.  It's a bit darker than previous installments, but still full of action and well timed humor."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A tragedy that two hundred million dollars in a budget can create such a bad film.  Think of all the good that money could have done in the world.  I had a feeling this movie would be terrible from the previews, including the unforgivable use of Elton John's ""Rocketman"" song, which of course is the theme song to Elton's own movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,was more of a family power movie and it didn't really have any impact on the mcu
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a big Marvel fan, I loved this movie! Great story, great graphics and action, and some great humor as well."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Dont listen to the rotten tomatoe  score this movie was great and Johnathan majors is that guy he made this movie üëçüèø üëçüèøüëçüèøüëçüèøüëçüèø
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,This doesn't feel like a movie. It's more like a dull episode from the 5th series of a TV show that hasn't been good for many years. Yawn.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fast-paced, action-packed fantasy thriller that does it's job of introducing Phase 5 and Kang. Critics are clearly digging into the ""comic book fatigue"" and not seeing it's value as a Marvel movie. That being said, Marvel definitely made a better Star Wars movie than Lucasfilm has in a while."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great performance by Johnathan Majors. Honestly the whole cast was good but he was great. Looking forward to seeing all his variants. Not sure why the majority of the critics dislike the movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The CGI, despite having some flawed moments, is overall amazing, and the soundtrack manages to be the same way. The whole environment and scenery can be very beautiful visually. Kang is very well presented, not to mention the post credits scene, and all the evolution of the other characters is very well done, with the exception of Wasp, who doesn't do much during the film, and the secondary characters are captivating. The humor is well balanced with action and other more serious moments, and it had me laughing."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I like it alot more than I thought I would.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critic's score. This movie felt more like a Marvel movie of old, with some darker and lighter undertones.  These days, the MCU has been fraught with either over the top humor or out of character darkness.  I think quantumania strikes a nice balance, without going too far down either path.  It is enjoyable and sets up the MCU moving forward. Jonathan Majors played an amazing Kang!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie, fun to watch, interesting and cool concepts being explored. An absolute Must Watch for a Marvel fan."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A solid entry to the MCU. Nothing amazing, but a good watch for sure!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is not as bad as critics (And some youtubers) made it out to be, I definitely enjoyed it more than Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness (And those have higher scores, which I don't understand tbh). I see the flaws it's no where near perfect, the mid-credit scene could've been executed better and certain moments could've been done differently but a enjoyable movie. 6.5/10"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a really fun movie a great introduction to Kang and Modok.  The Quantum realm is a sight to behold, and I will be seeing it again in the theater!
Don't know why the critics are panning it, but I guess critics will be critics.  The Audience score is usually a better indicator of how enjoyable a movie is anyway, so I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys fun, visually stunning, action-packed movies!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great introduction for the Quantum Realm 
Kang was menacing can't wait for more Jonathan majors   I enjoyed the Star Wars type of monsters and humor was creative overall great time at the movies"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie. The humor, action and visuals kept ke engaged the entire time. Kang was sick!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Y'all hating so much on MCU. This movie was epic, it sent shivers down my spine. This movie is a great start to Phase 5 after all of the mid Phase 4 movies, and I'm looking forward to the rest of Phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,MCU dead and gone RIP
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great way to start off phase 5 of the MCU by showing the true power of Kang the conqueror, but the pacing of the movie feels way off with too much all at once with no deep meaning to the story"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not quite the worst Marvel movie, but very close. Completely wasted Kang and MODOK."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,While the movie was beautiful and had great characteristics both in humor and seriousness. It left a few things wanting in terms of how they planned and setup the ending.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don‚Äôt mind the critical reviews.  It was very entertaining.  It does well in keeping the quirkiness of the past Ant Man movies while establishing Kang as the future big bad of the MCU
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is more for the fans than critics. Sure MODOK is goofy and it does have a Star Wars vibe at certain points, but Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeffier killed it. Comic book fans will love the post credit scenes."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Hard to watch ‚Ä¶ storyline was not great .. what a disappointment
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing! The absolute best MCU movie since No Way Home. It bridges story elements from Loki, Ant Man, Endgame and carries the overarching story forward towards Secret Wars that is truly exciting! The mainstream critics are dead wrong and are playing politics with Kevin Fiege, Marvel and Disney to try and sink them. This movie is badass! Kang is a the best villain yet!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,My theater and myself had an absolute blast in this movie! At moments we laughed (MODOK is hilarious) and the story kept us on edge. Can wait to see how phase 5 plays out from here.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantumania is a fun and funny MCU movie. It's also kind of your typical Paul Rudd movie. Quirky and funny. Don't go into it expecting Infinity Wars. Just have fun watching a good MCU movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"No spoilers: A solid beginning to Phase 5 and the kickoff to the eventual Kang Dynasty film. The film has a great exploration of the quantum realm, explains where Janet had been and builds even more into Scott Lang/Ant-Man as a true Avenger. I felt it had a great balance of comedy and action and the entire point is to build Kang. Which it did. Better than a lot of Phase 4 offerings."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"PHASE 5 OF THE UCM STARTED BADLY, THEY ALWAYS FALL INTO FORCED JOKES. MAYBE THEY HAVE RUN OUT OF IDEAS??"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,this movie good 72 percent for good start to phase 5 kang presents is felt but to honest dont listen to critics and the nerds all theyy is read comic books have no social life there lost its for lowkey nerds who have a social life and did things like played sports as a kid
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was great! If only they left out the not so funny jokes it would of been a great start to phase 5!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Story was basic and predictable
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the film that opens Marvel Phase 5 introducing the future threat of humanity, Kang the Conqueror.

Film directed again by Peyton Reed, with script by Jeff Loveness. In the feature we will accompany Ant-Man on a new adventure, however, in the quantum world against a new enemy, Kang.

The film accompanies the cast that we have all adopted from previous films and based on the charisma of each one of them, however, the character Janet played by Michele Pfeiffer reaches a little more weight for the plot, because, it is through her that it is presented. a bit of the environment and also the antagonist of the work, a much-awaited character for those who are more attentive to the events of the Marvel saga in general.

With the characters sucked into the Quantum world, it only remains for the script to present what the world is like and what the creatures that live there are like. The scenarios would be like the bottom of the sea, only without water, and a star wars without being in space, I think that's basically it. Apart from the setting of the Quantum Underworld, the film's mission is to present the story of Kang the Conqueror and the reason why he cannot leave there. Luckily, the character is played by Jonathan Majors who has charisma and plenty of presence on the scene and every moment of his appearance is good to watch, but his threat is not yet demonstrated in this film.

Without many details, so as not to spoil the surprise of those who like it and haven't seen it yet, Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania walks like every other film by this hero, in a firm and safe direction without far-fetched twists that could have serious consequences in the near future. The special effects in my view have improved, except for a single character who still looks like we're playing a PS2. If you like the previous ant-man films, the third in the saga will not disappoint you, but if you expect something great, the blow is strong. The script also suffers from some demands and simple ironies, perhaps because it focuses more on Scott and Cassie's relationship and on Kang's threat that they forget the other open fans in the feature, but the film's shuttlecock does not fall to the ground for that. And here we don't have fan service every 5 minutes, which for me is a relief right now, I believe that as an early film from Marvel's Phase 5, the feature manages to set the tone for what's to come."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. Kang was incredible
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its a great improvment over the last MCU movies, the script, cgi, direction, its easily the best MCU movie since No Way Home. Its not flawless, but the flaws are few and not that important, a must-see for those who like Ant Man 1 and 2, because its a improvment over both of them. Finally giving Ant Man the weight of being an Avenger, with great performance from all involved."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a great intro to Phase 5! KANG looked amazing and Paul was Paul! Go see this!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a fun, intense adventure that sets up the vast future of the MCU. While this movie does tie up some threads from phase 4, it also introduces lots of new factors into the multiverse saga."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was such a fun movie! Full of action! Tons of laughs and an all around good time. I enjoyed every part of it!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great experience to see the movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed, think of entering Phase 5 this movie serves as prologue & chapt 1. Loved mid&post credit...Jonathan Majors is perfect for MCU's next big bad."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie was really good Ann's had a great storyline but cgi was really weird for M.O.D.O.K but it was still good
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very silly, visually stunning, sometimes messy romp for Ant-Man and his crew, that is ultimately saved but the lovability of Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors being a POWERHOUSE as Kang."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A strong entry from Marvel. A fun popcorn adventure with a dose of thrills and drama throughout. Recommended for a joyous weekend üíØüëäüèª
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Filme √≥timo!!!!! Cr√≠ticos n√£o passam de belas bostas Soberbas.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was just what I needed! Positive! Visually stunning! Fighting against impossible odds to succeed. And truly, about family coming together. 

I really loved it and have to say I love how the MCU is building to the Kang Dynasty. I don't know much about that character but the way he is being introduced is enthralling and quite frankly leaving me ready for more and more."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Expected continuation of very bad writing at Marvel since Infinity war. The film is very predictive and disappointing, the latter to the same degree the last Thor, Strange and Spiderman were - an underwhelming and poorly explored concepts such as the multiverse, the quantum realm, power levels etc. It's just a big circus and neither Marvel nor the hc fans care about the story any more, as long as all the swords, all the kangs and all the ""finals"" make the cut."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"best antman movie among 3 
must watch"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Inventive story ideas and highly creative art direction. While it isn't perfect, it's far from terrible and can be a lot of fun for the whole family."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is Good..
it is a perfect AntMan movie and proper set up to what is coming....
the weak variant of Kang is so Strong... cant wait to watch other Variant's rampage in coming movies...they could kill Hank Pym's character in this movie that would be a great sendoff to character and MODOK nerfing is bad"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantamania was genuinely much better than most other MCU project in the last 2 years. The movie is fast paced and action-packed but doesn't abandon humor or terror inbetween. Jonathan Major's portrayal of Kang The Conqueror is maybe among the best MCU performances ever. Michelle Pfeiffer absolutely manages to steal every scene she's in and for a majority part of the movie, she is the protagonist. Paul Rudd is ever so charming but Scott Lang seems to have grown a bit wiser than he was and also a little more pessimistic about the world. Cassie lang is a caricature rebel-teen but the actress manages to pull off the character with grace and skill. MODOK is also a menacing and Irresistibly comical presence. The Battle sequences in the movie(there's a lot of them) are great. The supporting cast is all so brilliant and even the quantam rebel people are worth rooting for. A tale as classic as it gets. This felt more like a 80's Sci-fi Blockbuster than a typical MCU flick which is great. The movie does have a few places it could have improved but overall its a great experience and is trully stands out on its own among the recent superhero flicks. The 2 post credit scenes might just be the best ones in a long time. A Great start to Phase 5 and an amazing end to the Ant-Man trilogy. The greatest flaw of the movie is the total absence of Michael Pena and his infamous monologue..."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not sure what the hate is about.  I had a great time and laughed a lot. MODOK was fun and Kang was Amazing.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw this movie yesterday at 3:30 PM. Seems like Disney Marvel is getting back to classic superhero movies (fingers crossed) instead of soap boxing. This is one of those movies where you should see it in theater because there are a lot of visual things that are very sensory pleasing and has enough action to keep you engaged throughout. If you're a fan of classic superhero movies in the line of the original Spider-Man trilogy or anything pre-phase 4 this is for you. A fun ride and one of those the journey is the experience kind of deal Jonathan Majors is really good as Kang and I look forward to seeing some of his other interpretations of the character as variants. In my opinion, this would be the strongest Ant-man film to date."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man 3 was pretty dope.  Went in with low expectations from over critical reviews.  The multiverse and quantum relm is pretty fascinating.  A great launch pad into the next phase... is it the best...?top 15 maybe. Top tier budget. Great visuals. Have to sit with it. One of the most imaginative so far. 
Some won't like it, some will love it... I liked it. Great way to decompress for 2hrs."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Beautiful background. Tons of action
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant Man 3 is a very fun movie and a great entry in the MCU saga. I look forward to seeing Phase 5 unfold.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"At first watch this movie seemed alright. However, it is undeniable that Kang was wasted, as much as he was one of the only good things about the movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a great entry to phase 5. Jonathan majors killed it! Paul Rudd was excellent and it was a great story. So excited to see what's next.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,This film having major tonal issues and a super short runtime makes this new addition to the MCU just‚Ä¶ meh even though Kang was good for most of the runtime.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly a must watch if you are a marvel fan! I had a lot of fun watching this movie! Critics have no clue as to what they are talking about. This movie IS enjoyable if you‚Äôve kept up with the MCU including the Disney+ projects. But I do understand how some audiences might find it confusing if they are coming into this movie with little to no knowledge about the MCU and it‚Äôs state so far in the multiverse.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang was great and this sets up a good future. But overall the movie felt messy and oddly paced
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The goal of this film is to setup the next phase of the MCU. It achieves its aim beautifully. As a standalone superhero film, it could use a little work but it was still a fun movie worth checking out in theaters. Jonathan Majors was fantastic as Kang, and in the context of MCU phase 5, the mid-credit and post-credit scenes blew my mind."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not the best start to Phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good not best. Definitely not bad. Jonathan Majors is he who remain shines. Overall Entertaining.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's boring, it's not good. I should've avoid to watch this movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm all for comedy in the mcu. Its a major part of many of the other films. This felt like they were trying to have the same feel as Thor Ragnarok, but ended up being more like Thor Love and Thunder. Kang got nerfed the entire 3rd act and it felt sad to see this new big bad that will be around for a few years lose that way. The comedy was poorly written and the timing was off the entire movie. It was enjoyable at times but it just feels like a 2.5 star."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"48% by the critics? No wonder newspapers and magazines are dying, these people are stuck-up losers. This was a good movie with some great characters. Was it the greatest MCU movie ever? Absolutely not, but it falls somewhere in the middle of the MCU universe as far as watchability and overall enjoyment. Don't listen to the critics, go see this movie. You will have a good time."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good set up for phase 5. I enjoyed the storyline although it had some cringey moments notably involving Cassie and MODOK. Was missing the lovable character Luis from the first two movies which is always going to impact the ratings.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"**Contains Slight Spoilers**

You are watching for the place, not the people. Welcome to the Quantum Realm. 

This movie is a fantastic addition to the Marvel Universe and is probably one of the best movies they have made in recent times. It is, though, and ""Ant-Man"", Paul Rudd's dad-humor movie, which although it is not favored by some of the Marvel fanbases, is what you should expect from the character, that's who he is. And the characters we are introduced to in the Quantum Realm will steal your hearts. 

But, Jonathan Majors carries this movie HARD. His performance as Kang is chilling and a great introduction to what the universe will have to fear in the films. Seeing him in Loki convinced me the casting was perfect, but seeing him actually fulfill the role takes the cake. Marvel did the world right by casting him as Kang. 

Overall, there are not many *negatives* in this movie, coming from an Ant-Man film. Could have been more emotional for the heaviness this movie was supposed to carry (in fact, it was not emotional at all... they killed off an irrelevant character cameo). I wish it could have actually taken up the name of the ""Avengers-level movie"" that Kevin Feige gave it, but because of this, it did not. 

I do suggest watching it, it is a great addition to the franchise, and will definitely come back to you if you don't."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Quality movie but has its problems. Modok had some cringe scenes but everything else was great. Script was definitely not perfect an di thing people hate cassie to much. Kang was weak compared to what he should be and they will have to give kang alot more motive and inspiration to be more of an avengers level threat but it should not be 48%. I thought this was just as enjoyable as most marvel projects since infinity wars its just not the best but definitely worth watching. For my mum who knows nothing about marvel she found it really confusing and didn't like it so and alot of the script calls back something from previous ant man movies
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,What To Be expected from an Ant-Man Film. Was Great wish it had a bit more. Overall Recommend seeing it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie Imo Paul Rudd is super charming as Scott and you root for him to win Jonathan Majors as Kang is a threatening a$$ hole but in a good way He's a hgellava actor Michelle Pfeiffer unbelievably at 64 looks amazing as Janet and she pulls off being an OG super hero Definitely one of the better MCU movies since Infinite War Worth the price of admission
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great start to the new phase.  This movie kept the humor and heart that made the previous two films good, but this one turned up the adventure and sci-fi to the max.  Kang has proven that he will be a force to be reckoned with moving forward in the MCU.  The whole Ant-Man family going through this journey together made it an awesome film to experience with my own family.  If you're a Marvel fan, a Sci-fi fan, or just love fun movies then go see it!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was fun as usual for an average MCU Film. I'm just kinda disappointed on how this movie was executed. It's like they don't even know what kind of movie they are doing. Making it much less of a ""pallet cleanser"" certainly, had an effect on this film."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed this movie, great action, jokes landed and Kang was everything we needed him to be as the next big bad!!! The Post credit scenes were top notch! See this movie as soon as you can!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was SO entertaining. It really showed that all Marvel Phase 4 were leading up to a bigger picture. It seems as if anyone putting negative reviews clearly isn't a fan and saw the movie as a standalone. The action, the dialogue, the characters and the story were all just absolutely intriguing and capturing. 10/10."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked Quantumania. Not nearly as bad as many made it out to be. Definitely won't be for everyone. Definitely an improvement in terms of overall quality compared to a great number of phase 4 titles, not that that's a super high bar...ü§£

All that said, my kids LOVED it. 

I'd rate it 7.5/10, a good, middle of the pack MCU movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"90% of the movie is cgi but you won't realize that because this movie is very well done and .
the story will hook you the whole time, i just loved the movie but i found some acting parts forced and very funny things like the guy with the big head there.
btw awesome movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"very fun, funny, not as good as I hoped for. But it's worth the ticket!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Marvel have again produced a movie that is passable at best. Easily forgettable and will not be a necessary repeat during your next ""Marvel marathon"""
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie with good visuals and enough action and fun to reach the end of the movie. It was almost to much to process but I liked it, marvel should consider having more of a story in their films in the future though."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,S√≥ n√£o . N√£o √© poss√≠vel . Esperem sai na Disney Plus.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Is it an Oscar winning film no, but in the realm of Marvel I thought it lived up to the expectations I had going into it. The action sequences were fun and well done, and the funny parts mostly landed. I thought they did a good job of setting up Kang and his variants for the next phase. Not the best Marvel movie by any means, but it was still fun and enjoyable."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"awesome movie by marvel, really gets me hype for phase 5 can't wait for gotg3, this movie has great action, a great villian and a interesting take on the quantam realm."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very Fun! LONG LIVE KANG!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very enjoyable.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Saw it last night. Overall, an entertaining movie to enjoy and have fun for a couple of hours. Plot wise? Well, some serious opportunities. Meaningful? Not so much."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the entire movie. Kang was fantastic. The people complaining about the humor in this movie need to realize it‚Äôs ANTMAN
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible movie! Good story with an awesome villain in Kang! Much better CGI and VFX than most of Phase 4. A must watch for any Marvel fan!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"movie was great, great action, jonathan mayjors is a must see as kang, paul rudd was awesome as usual, i love it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a great movie! Good humor and great performances especially from Kang the Conqueror. I don‚Äôt know what the critics saw to give such a low rating. Worth the time and money!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors made this watchable, but the story is too abstract. The multiverse-thing combined with some sort of end-of-time thing is not enough to drive home a good bad-guy plot, especially without any blackboard scene to explain it. And Michael Pena was not in it. I left before the second credits scene."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,New bad guy Kang is amazing... the rest felt a bit flat.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A new way to do a Marvel movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Was excited to see this, was hopeful that it would be a return to the old mcu movies. I was wrong. It's still the same ""next generation is better"" without earning it. Kang was cool and I want to see more but hope we aren't getting him as the bad guy for a bunch of stuff now. Defeating him made him not seem like a huge threat. I just wanted a fun movie and instead got a pretty boring one with everyone beside Antman just instantly amazing at everything. Nothing was earned and I think I'm done now with the MCU after so many terrible movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Do not bother yourself with critic reviews and go for it, I almost cancelled my tickets after reading the pre-release reviews and now I have seen the movie myself and can say that critics are shitting on this movie for no reason. It's an excellent movie! It's just that Endgame has set the bar so high and people keep comparing everything with it. Not the perfect movie obviously but a great watch."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"While some parts of the movie dragged and I thought some of the extended characters were unnecessary, the surreal aspects of the quantum realm along with Johnathan Major's Kang make this a fun watch. There were some interesting action sequences, but the world building and Kang are the highlights. MODOK was fairly funny too. The 2 post credits scenes hint towards big future events, and that's always exciting. (6/10)"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"PEAK MOVIE, EVERYTHING IS AMAZING AND KANG WILL BE AMAZING VILLAIN IN UPCOMING MCU MOVIES"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall, a great movie. The villain is outstanding, Paul rudd and the supporting cast are great to watch, and the comedy is just right. This movie does a good job at setting the stage for the future."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie. The story is an interesting one and being an antman movie, it has humour. It's on another scale compared to the previous two and puts the tiny hero up against one of the most intimidating villains marvel has had to date. It's not marvel at its best but it is a good movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining science-fiction, comic-booky (Marvel Studios) film with a good main villain."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another post-Endgame flop.  Too much CGI and not enough character development or story.  It is bad.  Not as bad as Eternals or Thor: Love & Thunder, but pretty close.  

The sum of this story is told in the mid-credit scene.  Save you self the time & money.  Wait for it to stream."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Admittedly, I am a big marvel fan but I'm honestly wondering if the critics saw the same movie I did. I loved this installment in the Ant-Man franchise, much more than the second one. Kang is a serious threat and he's well executed by Jonathan Majors. The story is quick-paced and funny in the right moments, though I wish we spent more time with Kang. It stays very true to the Ant-Man vibe and Paul Rudd is a delight as always. What's not to like?"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,great intro to Phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant start to Phase 5, do allow biased ""verified critics"" spoil your movie experience. Go out and watch to make your own thoughts"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great fun!!! Fantastic introducin on jonathan majors first film apperance!!! Only 1 tone shift that didnt really work for me but other than that one complaint fantastic start to phase 5!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can understand why the ""critics"" have it low, they have too in this day and age when it comes to this niche style of a super hero movie. But the audience score will finish closer to 80 because it's exactly what you expect going in as a marvel fan. Along with Kang being the best part of the film, which is what most are going in hoping as he will be the glue holding the next phase+ , it's a stepping stone of a movie and it does it's job perfectly."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good film kang the conqueror was so good.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything!!! Going see it again.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una pel√≠cula muy entretenida y con un apartado visual muy hermoso, realmente la disfrute mucho, el cast es impresionante y siempre amo ver a Paul Rudd es de lo m√°s carism√°tico de hollywood"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed it, marvels best movie since Endgame easily. I feel like the whole ‚Äúcomic book fatigue‚Äù is being brought on my critics who are just over these types of movies in general. Thought M.O.D.O.K was hilarious, and it is definitely setting Kang up as the next big bad."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a fan of Marvel, or enjoy the action packed movies filled in with some drama, comedy, and serious scenes, then this is a good watch. Every actor/actress in this movie acted phenomenally. The visuals were great as well. I will say that it is not the best marvel movie, but a great introduction of Kang and entering into the new phase. Very excited to continues to see Jonathan Majors."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure what the critics expected from an Ant-Man movie but it's exactly what I hoped it would be. Fun adventure with great visuals and a setup for Kang.. Unlike the last few MCU moves (Thor, Black panther and Dr Strange), this one will be watched multiple times when its included on Disney+"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I really luv'd the first two Ant Man movies and was looking forward to this one. However, this one had very little of the playful charm of the previous ones. The opening was fun, and a little bit at the end but most of the movie was just one endlessly long battle scene after another with little to no character interaction or meaningful dialogue whatsoever."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Contrary to some critics' reviews, this movie was not a complete failure, but far from it, but the best, but not the worst. A great introduction to Kang and his world, though his character was downplayed a tad. All acting was great and contrary to other reviews, it was overall an enjoyable movie which I'd recommend."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,thought it was better than the first 2 ant-man's and felt more like a super-hero movie. Paul Rudd kicks ass.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely phenomenal,the quantum realm was amazing.A visual feast for movie lovers.paul rudd was good as expected, really developed his character.kang was on point, Jonathan majors deserved this role and I'm excited to see what to come next.There are two post credit scenes which are mind blowing."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The new ""Big Thanos Style,"" bad guy is literally defeated by socialist ants.  The writing is bad.  The CGI is bad.  Bill Murray's worst performance as an actor.  Kang was totally under sold.  What was marvel thinking?"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was fun and well done. The critics are way off base and I though it set up phase 5 very well. 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's still a movie that's full of fun and can't be missed because it leads to the next chapter. But one thing that can add more fun to the story if you have time to go into a little more detail.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I felt something after watching this film, that I haven't felt in subsequent years following Infinity War/Endgame. There were issues with the film, but the brightsides absolutely outnumbers the issues. Kang is an amazing villain, and they show you why he's the perfect follow up to Thanos as the next ""big threat."" If you enjoyed the hype leading up to the last two Avengers films, then you'll enjoy this film."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I wanted more Wonderland and Oz, less Fant-man Menance"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really great. VFX could have been better because of 'The Volume' it kinda felt gimmicky. It takes the multiverse a leap forward. Kang was the MVP. His screen presence can be felt and sets him up as the next baddie. Best Ant Man movie ever!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Thought it was a fun movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a ant man movie, just phenomenal.
Don't believe critics as they are biased, they rated she hulk above 75%"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"people are just stupid get ur mental health checked up pls guys u need it, stop criticizing everything u cant even imagine what they have made these guys r just so good, look at jonathan majors acting and finally antman his actually giant man look in this movie people r so dumb i just dont get it get some help bro"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,There‚Äôs a lot of plot points that are not thoroughly developed and I didn‚Äôt like the lighting/focus.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Critics are basically right ab this one. Not as bad as Wakanda Forever or Thor, but man yet another Marvel slog. It's been too commonplace lately. Majors isn't as good as critics have been saying, but he is certainly not a problem here, and again I feel like he'll only get better with time. The main heroes, like always, are underwritten asf, and it doesn't feel like their movie. Oh, also Ant Girl is literally a member of Antifa and Hank Pym preaches socialism. Not gonna come back to this one anytime soon."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is in the bottom 1/3 of MCU for us but it was just as cheesy as previous ant-man movies. Kang is awesome. The 2nd villain was also similar arch as they are recently portrayed them. The direction on acting seemed a little off for Michael Douglass in this one. We liked it, didn't love it, but still better than some MCU"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,After reading the critics reviews I wasn't expecting it to be great but man were they wrong. The movie kicks it into high gear fast and speeds up. Fresh ideas and environment for the 3rd installment in the Antman trilogy! The effects look amazing you can really be amazed with the 360 screen they shot in. I always enjoyed the humor in all three films but this one feels a little more adult then the other 2. All the actors in this movie did a great job but jonathon majors really sticks out as a great performance and breathes new life into what seemed like a dying franchise. Make sure to stay for the 2 post credit scenes.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Such an impressive storyline. This film has truly set the path for Marvels Phases 5 and 6! The Kang Dynasty has begun and Kang the Conqueror is a much more terrifying villain than his Thanos predecessor!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"While it has its flaws, quantumania proves to be an entertaining, creative and solid entry to the mcu catalogue. Some may not be pleased with the ending and MODOK may be a bit too annoying though. The critics are being too harsh"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It doesn't change almost anything in the MCU, it has some identity issues and some disposable dialogues and characters, but it's an acceptable film. Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer are flawless!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,If your were expecting infinity war or endgame level movie than I have bad news for you! Just a great popcorn movie you can't take seriously I enjoyed it very much
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Even though this movie was 2 hours it felt like 5. The main issue here was overcomplicating a low stakes plot. You could've easily shaved off 40 minutes and kept it interesting. Removing most comedic and lighthearted elements that made the first 2 Ant-Man movies great was also a mistake. Jonathan Majors was okay but the way the movie dragged it out made his first appearance as Kang underwhelming and left me indifferent for the future. MODOK was the only bright spot here.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another case of critics REALLY not getting Marvel, because this was a great film and really sets us up nicely for what's to come in phases 5 & 6. If you want to know the true value of this film, pay attention to the fan ratings and ignore the critics."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome Movie, perfect starting of MCU phase 5"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The 3 star review stands for ""Meh, it passed time"", which is very accurate to what the movie was for the overall MCU. It passes time as a stepping stone for the overarching MCU story and establishing the next Avenger's-level threat. That part it did well. It didn't do much to advance the character development of the Ant-Man characters themselves, however except Cassie and maybe Janet. It definitely wasn't sure of how powerful it's characters were considering some extremely powerful characters were bested by characters who were bested by weaker characters. It's worth a watch to get to know Kang for sure and Jonathan Majors carries this movie on his back by a long shot. I wouldn't go by the critic reviews. These are the same people scored Loved and Thunder higher and that movie is a bottom of the barrel MCU dumpster fire."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was so much fun, I loved the craziness and laughed the whole way through. No plot, just vibes."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Creo que es el comienzo del renacer del UCM. Un villano espectacular!. Quien se baje del barco ahora que no se suba despu√©s.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a Marvel Movie, not the Godfather.  If you go there expecting that, you will be disappointed.

If you go there expecting 2 hours of action, good special effects and humor, you will be happy."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Without going into too many details: good action, a good introduction to the new big bad Kang the Conqueror, and good actors but the script had too much dialogue and the big sacrifice ended up being useless. Also, the CGI looked similar to Spy-Kids/Shark-boy and Lava-girl era."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is definitely better than thor love and thunder imo , And also brilliant acting by kang (Jonathan majors)."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best mcu movie EVER! It's a must watch. Great movie affects great story. Father and daughter moments. Great credit scenes what's to come for the future of marvel. Great cast and very funny. At the same time very serious could've been longer for Kang to see exactly his background story but above all else it goes straight to the point what he's there to conquer and Kang is a BADASS. Avengers better be ready for what's to come.

10/10"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is full of entertainment.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pelicula es de lo mejor que nos ha dado marvel desde EndGame. Los efectos visuales son impecables, con personajes entra√±ables y un villano que realmente intimida. Es un gran momento para ser fanatico de Marvel. Es definitivamente la mejor pel√≠cula de AntMan. Y tiene 2 escenas post creditos que pfff, nos adelantan un poco de lo que se viene en el futuro para los vengadores."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a solid and a nice entertainment superhero movie. Compared with the marvel trash we got in the last year its a good start in the next phase.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"AM&TW:Q was hella fun, good times, silly Jack Kirby nonsense sci-fi technicolor romp. This is the followup to Ragnarok that L&T wishes it was. Go see it in 3d."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Coming from previous two movies,  it might seem like this one was going to lose it's way since it had to deal with the introduction of Kang the Conqueror.  Just based on the epic environment and greater ramifications of the MCU, it would be easy to assume this.  Fortunately,  this was not the case and they were able to maintain the quirkiness of AntMan while weaving in the seriousness of Kang.  All performances were top notch and the Quantum realm was absolutely stunning. I think the only disappointment came towards the end of the movie where things seemed to get rushed in order to get people and places setup.  This has always been an Antman issue and it continues with this movie.  Overall, well worth seeing at the theaters and a great start to Phase 5 of the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was as expected, a nice fantasy action movie. Ending was predictable at 2/3's. As was reason for next ant man."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was good especially KANG!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I‚Äôm not gonna pretend I know who Kang is or that i know Marvel Comic villains, but Kang is cool. Also I like his power set and charisma. That being said the movie was okay. Ant man 1 is fire. It‚Äôs fun, entertaining and well grounded. It‚Äôs also not filler but expands on the entire Marvel universe in each entry which is great. However the 2nd and this one was just okay. I think a major character should have died so I could feel how dangerous Kang was. Spoiler not spoiler, like usual the heroes are too safe"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um dos filmes mais divertidos dos √∫ltimos tempos! O puro suco do entretenimento fam√≠lia, com aventura, fic√ß√£o cient√≠fica, humor e a√ß√£o. Uma excelente experi√™ncia no cinema, efeitos especiais impec√°veis."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just like anyone else, im impessed by Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror, his character brings different types of emotion to me. The visual effects are dope in this film. The minus point for me, its Kathryn Newton's performance as Cassie Lang. Except that, everything seem right so far."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great hehe
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't get what the critics hate about this movie? it was a perfectly fine and enjoyable movie. was it another endgame? no. but it was an Antman movie, what did you expect. all in all, it was a very enjoyable watch and far better than some other recent releases (I'm looking at you Thor love and thunder, and multiverse of madness) and even they were better than Thor the dark world."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought the movie looked really good, the CGI and special effects were better compared to past marvel projects.  The Quantum realm feels like a Star Wars like universe tucked underneath the MCU, and the world building was superb throughout the film and into the post credit scenes. The plot relies on some big conveniences, like the ants showing up at the end.  Kang was really a really strong character and had good scenes on screen, but more of Kang would have helped. The movie is all around a lot of fun and the new scenery is really cool, but the plot has some holes and the story was underwhelming in its entirety."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Went in with low expectations because if the reviewer scores and was pleasantly surprised.
The jokes had me laughing most of the time.

I think if you are a fan of Marvel and just want a nice popcorn flick, you will have a good time. The storyline now involves multiverses and time travel and if you over analyze it then it gets messy and you probably won't enjoy it.

Also there is A LOT of CGI even for a Marvel movie. Often not the best CGI either. But kind of unavoidable due to the setting and Covid.

Kang was great in terms of performance. I think they could have handled some things differently, and I am a little worried about how he will be treated as a the main franchise villain going forward but for the moment Im hesitantly optimistic."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Awesome introduction of how ruthless any variant of Kang can be. Enjoyed Grandpa-Granddaughter dynamic between Hank and Cassie. M.O.D.O.K. brought the classic Ant-Man humour to this rather dark sequel.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fantastic ride full of genuinely funny jokes and exciting visuals! The plot is strong as well. Honestly one of the best marvel movies I've seen in years!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Movie is awesome.But ""who the hell gave marvel that idea of putting Kathyrn Newton as Cassie Lang?""  The movie would be better if she played her role well."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie.  World they created is amazing visual.  Fun jokes but a very serious tone.  Love the family feeling the movie has.  Everyone had their moment to shine but Scott really comes to the front.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyable and entertaining. I had fun.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Uff, que puedo decir......kang el conquistador es lo mejorcito de esta pel√≠cula, Cassie me decepcion√≥ mucho üòñ 
En general la pel√≠cula fue como ver cuanquier otra pel√≠cula de Marvel, pero con malos chistes, y no me gusto como intenta hacer que te olvides de Thanos y que ahora te fijes en este nuevo enemigo, 
M.O.D.O.K, odie lo que hicieron con el, odie que en la segunda Aparici de Kang volviera a morir, en realidad no creo que este muerto, pero pienso que no deber√≠an haberlo puesto a Pelear con ant-man."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the critics. This movie is incredible. It sets up how badass Kang is and a solid performance from everyone involved.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the story, got to tell us about Janet's Story when she was stucked in the Quantum Realm. I'd recommend it"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved Paul Rudd comic reliefs and also a very good introduction for what is going to be the next big bad boy !
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie sums up the state of Marvel right now mediocre and a disaster I had enough and won't be paying good earned money to keep seeing below average movies.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, good humor, great performance specially Jonathan's.  All should watch, critics are idiots, do not consider their reviews!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I wanted to love this so much. But it was so much exposition. So much green screen. So little Wasp. And where's the fun of the first two movies?
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, heartfelt, psychedelic. Fun movie with great set up for what's to come. Kang is incredible!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Everyone but Jonathan majors gave the worst acting I've ever seen. Kang was the only good part of the movie for me.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie and great action. Sets up Phase 5! Really good trilogy film for Antman,as well intro for Kang."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The third entry of the AntMan franchise offered a change of pace that I thoroughly enjoyed. The dynamic between Cassie and Scott didn't feel as strong as past entries but she's also a teen who missed out on several years of her father. Ditching the priors supporting cast of comic relief was interesting but felt necessary to divert it from the street level antics we'd seen before. Majors performance was supper fleshed out and I think everyone's excited to see him juggle Kang personas as we inch towards the next Avengers movie and his inevitable appearance in Season 2 of Loki. All in all the film never felt choppy or rushed for me, the CgI was captivating and as always it felt like an ally-oop for what's to come with the MCU's narrative, in a bigger way than ever. While also staying true to ANTS!! A charming opener to Phase 5 in my book."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,cool movie. I'm start to finish!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not sure why all the critics are hating on this movie because this was a fun Ant-Man entry and definitely nowhere near the level of Eternals. Great watch and Kang went hard!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Im a major Marvel fan and loved the movie! There were a few jokes that didnt land and made me roll my eyes & much of the quantum realm felt like a planet in Star Wars but the acting was great and there was so much excitement!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is funny and a good time regardless of how many moments there are, the tense moments and drama take you by surprise and the characters from past screenings of Ant-Man are either still themselves or have secrets to uncover. This movie is it."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't know how it could be this bad... The movie is inconsequential to the MCU and can  be skipped entirely. Nothing of value happens. Kang was already introduced in Loki, and all this movie did was make him look bad."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The acting was great, there was a satisfying mixture of comedy and drama, and it was nice to see ants taking such an active role in a series called ""Ant-Man."" The CGI was fantastic--much better than that of ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" for instance--and the visuals were stunning. Kang is absolutely terrifying. My wife, who is not the biggest Marvel fan, really enjoyed the movie. There is very little to dislike here, and I'm not sure why the critics are giving out such harsh ratings. Probably the best Marvel movie I have seen since Endgame!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is amazing, Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly give an excellent performance, but the one who definitely steals the spotlight is Jonathan Majors as Kang. This movie reminded me of the first MCU films.
It's a fantastic first step into Phase Five of the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a great way to begin phase 5. It introduces the big bad while being a really fun and enjoyable movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's not that bad like the critters Claimed it's everything marvel is known for and it seat's up the future of the MCU perfectly
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought this was really uninspired and poorly made. Maybe my least favorite MCU movie. I'm hopeful about Guardians 3 at least.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Bad vfx in some places. M.O.D.O.K was wasted but overall the movie is good and entertaining.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Once again the critics and the audience score show a giant divide.  Maybe if critics had to spend $100 for the family experience of a movie they might give reviews that actually reflect peoples' intentions when going to the movies.  We don't want Shakespeare in the park.  We can get that for free any time.  We want entertainment, spectacle, thrills on a big screen.   This movie has all that and it does it just as well if not better than all the Marvel movies so far.   Now admittedly, yes, there is plenty of cringe and cheesy messes while the dialogue appears to come from a 10 year old.  However, it stands on its own along with any other Marvel move and it feels like it really left its audience with a true signature of optimism and fun rather than trying to get nonsensically emotional through meaningless or pointless endings.  One of the few Marvel movies I really want to see again."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,L movie had like no good charters
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm so happy they gave Michelle Pfeiffer something to do, that's all I wanted, this fan is served. üòç"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors, who plays Kang, was the best part. I also enjoyed the scenes with Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas. The movie was a bit too visually busy, like many Marvel movies, but was decent overall."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. It was a lot of fun and a great way to kick of phase 5.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie! This installment was much more action packed than the first two movies combined.  The silly tone is dialed back (well except the end of Modok) lol.  It was very fun.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors IS KANG, absolutely riveting performance. Overall, an interesting departure from other other two Ant-Man films. At times the story gets a messy here and there, but all in all a fun time at the movies. 2 excellent post credit scenes as well!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was so good. Kinda a mix of star wars and science. Really awesome and Kang was such a good bad guy
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Weak script, which made it painful to watch, making no joke land and no sense of danger and... Will we talk about MODOK? Oh my! Maybe the worst re-use of actor in the MCU. The only thing that stands out is Kang (Jonathan Major). However, if you watched Loki (series), you already knew all Kang's speech (goal)."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While I did enjoy this film and would recommend seeing it, it's still more middle of the road for me when it comes to MCU films.  It's fun and has a lot good stuff in it, but the editing and pacing don't always work for me.  Kang is absolutely amazing but I wish they would have spent more time exploring what got him stuck in there in the first place.  Can't wait to see more Kang!  Janet Van Dyne is fantastic and is a real stand out amongst the heroes."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was great! Really great introduction to Kang the conqueror. Go watch!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Same old fun DCU movie, but I enjoyed it a lot.  Kang is absolutely amazing new villain, can't wait to see more what remains of hims!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining, great villain, great caracters, GREAT MOVIE"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's great to see that beyond the outstanding visuals, and the crazy plot, the movie manages to make sense of it all, showcasing the new big bad guy (Kang) in a powerful way."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good continuation of the antman films and good start to the next phase-would have liked a bit more comedy relief in the form of his sidekicks from previous films
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was turn your brain off kind of fun, but wow this is evidence of a continued downgrade of MCU quality. Phase 4 was a bust, save a few nuggets of gold, and phase 5 is already looking rough around the edges. Hopefully Feige's promise to slow down and focus on quality over quantity isn't just PR talk."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Big step up from the previous phase wasn't the kang I was expecting but as the film rapped up I saw what they did and iam in that mid credit was phenomenal
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was great Paul Rudd does well as the every man
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyable movie, especially for one that had so much to set-up.

The plot is a bit loose but the jokes are good, the callbacks unexpected, and the action is awesome. Worth seeing for any fan of the franchise, or anyone looking forward to the next Avengers movie. 

Two gripes I had:

 - Cassie being another child genius. It was never really reflected in her MCU character before. I get the motivation, but I'm starting to lose track of child geniuses in the MCU.

- No Luis is a huge miss.

Overall, worth seeing for any fan of the franchise, looking forward to the next Avengers movie, or just want a fun movie to see over the weekend."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Bom filme, deu uma boa introdu√ß√£o do grande vil√£o dessa fase e apresentou um mundo bem interessante e divertido."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is a solid outing.  Much better than most of the reviews.  Although, I think it does benefit from the fact that Thor: Love and Thunder was SOO TERRIBLE.  This movie shines in comparison.  Maybe Marvel is just lowering our expectations."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Why are movie critics still a thing, I bet most people don't make their decisions to see a movie or not based on a ""critic"" review. They think they're smarter than everyone else.  Fun movie, but expectations are high for it since it was billed to be as critical as Civil War was to Phase 3, so you will need to temper them a bit, still a fun movie, not the best from Marvel, but after Infinity War and Endgame, that is extremely tough to do.  Recommend though."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The third addition to the Ant-Man trilogy was far different than the other two films, but not in a bad way. Unlike the first two adaptations, this film shows us why Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) deserves to be an Avenger. Going into this movie, Ant-Man was more of a comic relief type of Avenger that was not as hard of a hitter as Thor, Iron-Man, Captain America, the list goes on. But this movie gives us a more powerful and gritty Ant-Man which I really enjoyed. Kang the Conqueror (Jonathon Majors) completely steals the show. This film emphasizes the dark, looming treat that is Kang and shows what he is capable of. I am very excited with Marvel moving forward with him as the new ""big bad"" and he will carry the MCU for the next few years. The movie mostly takes place in the Quantum Realm, which is a strange looking place (if you are a fan of practical effects, you will most likely be disappointed with the amount of CGI in the film). But I found the Quantum Realm riveting and fun. It is filled with creatures you wouldn't find on earth or in the deepest parts of space, making you feel as lost as the characters that are in it. It was a refreshing take on the Ant-Man franchise and would go see it again. 7/10."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,They should of raised the stakes and killed off everyone except Kasey. Also modok was a mistake. Other than that the movie was fine.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It""s like watching Star Wars in another (small) universe , Jonathan Majors acting is brilliant"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Hilarious only gripe was the suits were a little off but by far better looking than the last Thor film and I truly left the theater laughing and excited with my friends about kangs future
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Didn't watch it yet but with rotten tomatoes giving it such a low score I know it will be fire
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worse of the worse...marvel is loosing it.... nothing to look forward to...... charector development of kang is very very poor and confusing and power is inappropriate.
we love marvel.why are you people don't see the declining of quality...or is it intentional."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,The plot is so lazy and unconsequent
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Muito divertido prende a aten√ß√£o do in√≠cio ao fim e deixa um hipe grande para os proximos filmes eu amei!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,I didn't hate this movie nearly as much as the critics made me to believe. It wasn't great though....but I was mildly entertained.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a really fun movie. Action was good. Kang was amazing. Can't wait to see other variants of his.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"IT WAS AMAZING! perfect ant man style movie, the perfect mix of humor and seriousness! The jokes hit! They weren't cringe, EVERYTHING ABOUT IT WAS AMAZING! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly hilarious whole theater was laughing out loud for certain scenes some of the cgi wasn't the best but by far better than Thor love and thunder and Kang is a bad ass
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a lot of fun. A big budget action flick as Marvel does Star Wars. Not sure why critics were so harsh on it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie pulled so much from the Marvel comic lore. A must see for any MCU fan. Seeing it for the second time tomorrow!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's good, but not perfect, the final scene of credits was so goood"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"As I saw it last night, it blew my mind away. The story did seem a little bit like Star Wars, but isn't that what Secret Wars and The Kang Dynasty is going to be like? YES and I am here for it.
Anyhooo
(IF READING BE AWARE OF SPOILERS AHEAD)
1) We finally get to see an onscreen relationship between Cassie and Scott because of the blip, and Scott being trapped in the quantum realm after the events of Antman and The Wasp. Which I was dying to see more of Cassie and Scott onscreen again. 
2) The movie balanced comedy, suspense, action, and emotional moments and it shows how Antman is always seen as ""the little guy"" going up against ""The Conqueror"" as it has a David (Antman) vs Goliath (Kang) aspect to it which fits in really well.
3) The story, sure I know a LOT of people would be like ""Ugh, no Taika Waititi funny! WE NO LIKE"" aspect. But the story really shows how tough Antman can be especially since he always gets looked down on a lot, but it really left me on the edge of my seat wondering ""Would Antman actually beat Kang?"" Which a lot of fans would probably say ""No way."" The introduction of Kang into the MCU was in Loki, but Quantumania really shows how big of a threat he can be. 
4) There are 2 ENDING CREDITS! (Stay around for them) at the end of the movie. 
5) Overall, this movie proved to be a better movie than Thor Love And Thunder and She Hulk, it is something fans would enjoy rather than hate. There's no overused jokes (Imma call out Taika on this one which I don't care, he's a horrible director). And not hearing ""Sweet Child Of Mine"" over and over is refreshing. The fact that the snobby ""Movie critics"" gave this movie a 43% but She Hulk and Love And Thunder a higher percentage really goes to show that we should not listen to those critics but instead, go see the movie for yourself! Enjoy it! I really think it's the best Marvel project we've gotten in 2023 so far. 
(WE ARE NOW IN THE KANG DYNASTY!!!!!!!)"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best Ant Man movie. Hugely due to Kang's storyline and Jonathan Majors' performance. The mid & post credit scenes
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great visuals, great plot, loses a star for Kang being nerfed in the end but really good movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a fun filled adventure you know and tbh mcu is still going strong.. it has a few ups and downs and as long as it still listens to it's audiences I think the mcu has a pretty bright future...
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Has the new marvel movie type feel, but there's enough other stuff coming together to tie it up nicely. It has a Star Wars feel which helped a lot."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pelicula es buena, cumple con las expectativas. El CGI es genial y eleva la vara para las proximas peliculas de personajes no centrales.
Las actuaciones son buenas. La presentacion de Cassie Lang con la nueva actriz es aceptable. Algunos agujeros de gui√≥n.
MODOK sobra. El punto bajo de la cinta."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is a solid movie. Set up Kang without putting all his chips on the table. Humor was cringe Marvel humor at times, but I liked how little of that unbearable humor came from Scott himself."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Coming into it all I saw was ""mid"" ""bad"" ""worst mcu movie"" and after watching they couldn't have been more wrong. This movie was good from start to the post credit scene. Kang was great, Majors was absolutely amazing. Cassie and Scott had good chemistry, modok was a scene stealer. I could go on. Perfect? No. But a good movie nonetheless."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant man and Kang quantumania
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall, I enjoyed Quantumania. It was a fun and funny continuation of the Mavel universe.  The story was a little thin but gave the characters just enough depth to make me care about them.  The acting was good, not great.  Some of the delivery was a little uneven.  Michelle Pheifer stood out.  I liked the humor.  A couple of the gags fell a little flat, but others were laugh out loud funny.  

I don't think this movie stands on its own very well.  It is definitely a link in the MCU chain.  So much of the movie is dependent on outside references, if you're not already into the MCU, this would not be a good movie to get started.  

The MCU really needs to give us Kang's origin and the backstory on the variants quickly.  Kang's motivation was not clear and sometimes left me feeling disconnected."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The hate was overblown. You would believe the hate is only because people when it with their own ideas for what they wanted in the movie instead of just enjoying what is in front of them. Did it have a some holes in it‚Ä¶ yes (this was a pun). However, the movie had the humor on the level of a Rick and Morty episode, which carried this film. Jonathan Majors was awesome as Kang. Can't wait to see him face the Avengers. 7.5/10."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm dumbfounded by the rotten critic score. It wasn't peak MCU phase 3 level quality but it was still a lot of fun. I guess it's superhero movie fatigue for certain types of viewers. Jonathan Majors was fantastic. My biggest gripe was that Bill Murray felt out of place and unnecessary.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Majors & Pfeiffer were standouts. I think only skewed expectations of what you thought this film would be could somehow leave you wanting something different from an 'Ant-Man' offering. This is not an Avengers size film, but the amount of world building it did was immense. We have a clear direction for the big arc to start phase 5. It created stakes, and it also had plenty of laughs. Only thing for me it was missing was Luis & Co. Cassie Lang will be a key member of the Young Avengers. MODOK was batshit in every way. Every time he was on screen my theater had a good laugh."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The film was alright but had a lot of improvements that could have been made, lacked in a good story and had average cgi. First credit scene leads to the next part of the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme promete trazer um vil√£o cativante que e diferente de tudo que a Marvel j√° mostrou, m√°s s√≥ passa de um falador, para os brasileiros o Kang √© igual pol√≠tico s√≥ promete e n√£o faz nada."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved this movie, only 2 complaints. Too many side characters, many seemed like they could have been trimmed from the script. Also,  the daughter just being a super genius in the span of 5 years was a little hard to believe"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen a lot of bad reviews for this movie, even one saying it was the worst MCU movie since Ant-man 2, and I personally totally disagree. The movie was great, Jonathan Majors carried and it was visually beautiful. The 2 post-credit scenes and the whole movie set an amazing futur for the MCU and the next Avengers movies, I can't wait to see them !"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman and the Wasp Quantumania is a fantastic movie, I went into being a little bit skeptical because I thought it was going to look ""weird"". I had the same initial impression of Thor Ragnarok, yet that movie was amazing and comedic as well. This movie terrifyingly introduces a new threat to the Marvel Cinematic Multiverse and I can't wait to see more of him. Now the elephant in the room when it comes to why some people dislike this film, MODOK, absolutely brilliant what Marvel did with his character. Every moment he was on screen me and my friends were laughing. Marvel was self aware of his silly design and took it to the next level, excellent choice of bringing back a past villain and making him goofy, I feel like most critics don't understand why he's so great in the film, they don't understand that ""goofy"" is Gen Z's humor. The only problem with MODOK I have is I wish he didn't die so we could see more of him. Another reason I this movie isn't perfect is, Antman's sacrifice at the end of the movie is worthless because he came back it seemed super easily, Marvel needs to make sure the sacrifices have worth like they did in past marvel movies. Overall I had an amazing time watching it and I will definitely see it again."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a fun time for all. The beginning is a little slow but gets a lot better in the second half. Like most new Marvel movies it has pacing issues. Great CGI and visuals.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Salvo algunos momentos de pronto desenlace (Modok), la pel√≠cula es disfrutable, con una fotograf√≠a espl√©ndida y que se siente como un verdadero inicio de algo mucho m√°s grande. Kang, Janet Van Dyne y Scott Lang son lo mejor de la pel√≠cula, sobre todo el villano que es intimidante y cuasi universal. Las escenas post cr√©ditos son de las mejores del UCM. La disfrut√©."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie has been a great start of phase 5 with a great movie. I was surprised no mayor protagonists died and the comedy was funny but could still be better. I think Kang and Cassie are great characters and I also loved to see more of Janet. I do think this movie could be a bit confusing but that's also because they can't rush everything.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid start to Phase 5. Great continuation of the Ant-Man and Wasp characters. Whole cast is well balanced with chances to shine.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Legitimately so much fun. I found myself smiling ear to ear for a majority of the film. Genuinely reminded me of the first time I saw a Star Wars film in a theater. The audience was laughing, gasping, and cheering throughout the entire movie. Cannot wait to see what Kang does next."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie. Kang was quite amazing and threatening
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Genuinely confused as to why this film has such a low critic score. This film does have a shift in tone and scale compared to the previous two films, but knowing it's place in the greater MCU franchise makes that shift necessary. Previous films were more intimate, with the threat being closer to the Pym/Lang family. This film has multiversal stakes, which means the film needed to grow up some to set the stage properly for the rest of the Multiverse Saga.
My only complaint to the film is that the second act is about 10 minutes too long. They build up the arrival of Kang a LOT...which is effective until it starts to feel a little grating. MODOK is excellent, the main cast are wonderful and compelling to watch, and Jonathan Majors is terrifying and his performance lifting every moment he's on screen.
If you are a Marvel fan excited to see what's coming next in the MCU, this film with be very enjoyable. If you wanted more of the same from previous entries you will get some of that, but might feel disappointed. Personally it was nice to be able to watch Antman and the Wasp Quantumania knowing that it was a foundation piece for the future, not a fun diversion from the greater MCU plot as has been the case before."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not my favorite out of the three Ant-Man movies but definitely worth the watch!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is AWESOME! Do NOT listen to the critic review scores because this film was so fun!

It is definitely the biggest (no pun intended) of the Ant Man movies, they face Kang, the devastating Conqueror who might not be exactly who he seems on the surface.

This film is NOT gigantic (pun intended), it wont introduce the Fantastic Four and the X-Men and also explore the multiverse.
It is a twist on the heist genre and the film is about Kang and the Quantum realm, don't expect any more or less.

MODOK was definitely really entertaining, wish I got more of him.
when people say ""This is the MCU star wars"" they're not wrong, this entire film is alien and strange with some amazing creature designs.

Kang is formidable.
the film genuinely gave me anxiety in the last half.

I can't recommend this movie enough for people who are interested in Ant Man or the MCU.
But keep in mind, even if its bigger (even more puns) it's still an ANT MAN film, and has a hint of that witty humour underneath all these politics and alien like pieces of the film.

A must watch."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie.   I wish it was a little more typical ""Antman"" funny, but you have to understand that it is also and probably more importantly setting up Kang as the next big Marvel threat so it can't be too funny.   Kang was great, and the story leading up to how he becomes the next big threat revealed in the post credit scene does really make sense.  Bill Murray's character was wasted for some reason.   Cassie was great coming into her own.   There were definitely some funny and cool moments mixed in with showing how powerful Kang can be."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the movie best ant man yet
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Majors is incredible! The rest of the movie is very forgettable. Not a bad movie, but does not leave a lasting impression."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, not perfect but definitely a fun time."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film is more like an origin movie for Majors' Kang the Conqueror. Most of the movie is about the Quantum Realm and how and why Kang is there. Kang is the movie's main focus even when he is not on screen. Majors nails this role and carries the film. I am looking forward o seeing him in Creed III. Rudd continues his Ant-Man charm and provides a lot of great lines and comical moments to keep the movie light-hearted when the stakes are indeed high. This movie would have fared better if it traded the upbeat tone for a much darker one for this third installment.

As seen in the trailer above, we finally get MODOK, and by no surprise, the character is just comical to see on the big screen. This infamous Marvel character will haunt my dreams. However, to my surprise, the MCU introduction of Katrhy Newtons Cassie Lang disappointed me. For me, she could have been more charismatic but is simply inadmissible. Evangeline Lilly is also weak in this movie and is very dry, making it hard to believe that Rudd's Scott Lang and her Hope are a genuine couple in love.

Every scene that Michael Douglas' Hank Pym was in was a scene stealer. With the current de-aging CGI technology like the one used on Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones, I would love to see a PYM Ant-Man movie. Michelle Pfieffer's Janet van Dyne is also great in her respective scenes, and her past experience in the quantum realm is paramount to the plot.

I give this third Ant-Man film 3.5 out of 5 stars. Paul Rudd embodies the character well, but the movie's real star is Jonathan Major, who delivers a Kang that is a force to be reckoned with. Stay tuned for two post-credit scenes."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a long-time Marvel fan, It is very sad to write what I am about to write.

This movie has been set up to be one of the most excellent super-villain introductions since Thanos. But because of lazy writing and overwritten dialog, the movie feels like something to be watched from a hotel cable tv because missing 50% of the storyline would make no difference. 

First, there's no development in the relationship between the main characters, and you don't feel the family vibes, even though they try it very hard in the first few minutes but mess it up by turning it in the roast of Scott Lang, which is already a less respected Super Hero, which by the way goes totally against the main philosophy and lesson of the movie  ""Look out for the little guy.""

When I say the writing is lazy, it is because they added a bunch of huge events to justify the storyline, which ended up being very repetitive as it's one teenager / young adult responsible for the leading cause of the chaos (Black Panther 2 & Doctor Strange 2). 

I don't care about CGI, but in this movie... there's something very annoying about looking at the character and noticing the displacement of the background and the lack of depth that almost look like a scene of a dream in a low-budget TV Show. Here I am not criticizing MODOK, which I didn't dislike, I loved that they dared to make it very weird and bizarre, but CGI could have been better in his case as well.

Kang, this guy, had everything in the movie to be the badass villain that he was supposed to be. The man was so strong and intelligent that he could be defeated by a whole army of his variants that had to be locked out in another dimension, but then lose a fight for the little guy that doesn't even know what his daughter is doing in the basement. This won't work, not to mention the first credit scene where the characters look like a class of students preparing for a school presentation with cardboard costumes. 

The first thing I asked a friend watching this movie with me was: How did Keving Faige watch this and say: release it! 

I am just sharing my thoughts, and I would recommend everyone to watch and make their own conclusions, but honestly, I think Marvel should rethink the recent decisions and invest more in writing than in a great cast. 

I would much prefer one movie yearly, but with the work and dedication, this universe deserves, especially giving the CGI team the time they need to deliver outstanding results."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Definitely better than the critics said it was. I was entertained throughout and will be going to see it again soon!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"this movie had a good set of cast members but it was not as great without Luis, but is still an amazing movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This makes the 4th MCU movie in a row (for me) that fell short. Shaky way to start off Phase 5 from a disappointing Phase 4. Johnathan Majors delivers as Kang but the writing nerfed his power to justify him fighting against the Ant-Family. The Quantum-realm at times was visually stunning but other times you can tell the actors were standing on a green screen stage, which kept me from being completely immersed. The ending was underwhelming and the tone of the movie was all over the place. Again, Marvel please stop with the corny jokes in the middle of serious situations. The post credit scene was amazing but made me wish I was watching THAT instead of this Ant-Man movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quatamania was a great way to start off Phase 5. Jonathan Majors was fantastic as Kang. Marvel is in good hands with Kang. The world building was very good. I think it out Guardianed GOTG.  Paul Rudd was excellent as were the rest of the family..
And by the way, the end credits were superb..  Far more entertaining than critics say.. Go see it!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action, Kang really stole the show and so excited to see him more. Paul Rudd and Michelle Pfiffer were the stand outs for the heros and really enjoyed seeing their story more. Movie was a bit overwhelming tho with a completely new area of the MCU but still fun."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It is worth watching . Good characters here
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is exactly what you'd expect an Ant-Man movie to be. It's an action/comedy with a couple of fun action set pieces. I'm blown away by how bad the critic reviews are Vs what the actual film is. I feel like I watched a different movie than the critics somehow.

This movie in my opinion falls pretty much mid-pack as far as MCU movies go. It's definitely not the best, but its FAR from the worst. 

My only complaints have to do with a lack of character arc for most of the heroes. Scott has a solid arc, Janet has a bit of one. But Wasp and Hank are just sorta there to save the day, and they set Cassie up for a good one that never gets completed, maybe in the next movie?

I also think that Kang was pretty great. But there's still too much timey wimey hand waving going on to feel like he's a real threat. In contrast to Thanos who felt like a threat from the first time he was on screen. But I have no complaints about Majors' portrayal. He was a strong point for sure."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It really hurts to say this but i didnt enjoy this as much as i hoped i would.
Everything until Kang shows up is pretty messy, Wasp is more like a side character, it was too Short, the CGI worlds made it feel like something else thats not antman, and some important characters who made the antman movies most fun like Luigi were just left out. The ending was also Meh
Only good thing about this was Modok (and kang). i loved him"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I truly believe that was the worst movie in the MCU. It has absolutely nothing original in it, not a single idea or thought, and if it's not enough - it succed to be a trainwreck on it's way to mediocrity. I could at least respect failure during trying something new, but not in that case. Absolute catastrophy."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is fun, which is what I wanted from it. I personally can people's complaints about things like Cassie Lang and how Kang the Conqueror got ""beat"" by a bunch of ants, which is why I didn't give it a perfect score.

I, however, did give it a higher score, because it is still an entertaining ride of a movie. Paul Rudd is a funny and charming as he normally is, he has the theater I was in laughing out loud. Jonathan Majors puts in the work in this movie playing the softer sides of Kang while also being able to turn it on in a menacing way.

I think overall the movie is fun, funny, and a good ride with some weaknesses that are fine with me, but I can see how someone may not like this movie for them."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great but I feel like marvel focused more on kangs introduction  as compared to Scott's main storyline and influence on the MCU, the movie was visually stunning"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"My only issue was it felt a little rushed. It was ALOT of new information for the MCU crammed into 2 hours.

Other than that, it was visually amazing, Majors absolutely killed it as Kang and I was thoroughly entertained/glued to the screen the entire time. I loved the movie and strongly recommend it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Overall a pretty fun time! It's not the most intellectual movie ever  which explains the critics scores understandably but definitely way better than a couple of the products Marvel put out during phase 4. A good start to phase 5 let's try to keep this up marvel!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A great movie to watching with family and friends. Very nice!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang the Conqueror is awesome
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a lot of fun. I think movie suffered from hyping up Kang too much. If we consider kang as normal 1 off villain this was awesome movie with awesome visuals. Don't expect Thanos vs antman type fight. Just see Kang as 1 of the versions
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,it was entertaining and humorous.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A solid funAnt-Man movie. Kang is amazing and the world building of the quantum realm is so exciting to see where marvel takes this in the future.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The screenplay was not that special. The movie was pretty much predictable. Aside that and minor technical flaws. 
It was absolutely enjoyable. As a Marvel fan, it was a blast. It is highly watchable.
I would put it in the top 15 MCU movies, cause I liked it way more."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It could have been better, the script is not fun like the previous installments but it does the job. It is painful that there is not the slightest chemistry between the main couple (fault of the script or EL?) And that boring couple defeats the big bad guy of the saga and takes away a lot of gravity from his presence, if the most terrible Kang was defeated in his first installment does not seem scary for the Avengers assembled"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely worth seeing. Did a good job of setting up Kang, will be interesting to see where it goes after this movie. Some parts at the beginning were confusing and didn't really seem to go anywhere, but eventually made sense."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It doesn't disappoint, although some of its lines sound like they were made sarcastically when they actually were trying to say something serious and important for the plot. Would recommend just for the VFXs, the best I've seen in a marvel movie since Endgame."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great acting, special effects and story"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall the movie provides a fun ride that keeps us entertained and sets up some awesome storyline for the MCU. Critics are being extra harsh on this film for some reason but casual fans and mcu fanatics alike that went to see with me were all happy with the film. Ant Man has always been the goofy side of the MCU and this movie continues to embrace that as well as the heist theme that always follows main character Scott Lang. Don't trust the internet on this one, go enjoy the movie and the wild ridiculous ride that only Ant Man can deliver."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was good and looked pretty in the realm but thats about it. The face on MODOK was stretched and another new addition to poor CGI, in this phase. Marvel movies r becoming a chore"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"not a good start for phase5, so disappointed."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Please save your money. I walk out halfway through the movie. Just plain awful.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"this felt very phoned in and by the numbers. nothing was exceptional, nothing was terrible. largely predictable. funny, but not hilarious, and they didn't run the jokes into the ground.

I've never like Kang as a villain, he's all over the map. if there was an actor who could have turned in a performance to make him stand out, it wasn't Majors. he wasn't terrible. he was just... fine. and fine acting matched with a dull character is just dull."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie feels like wasted potential with the writing being it's downfall. Not only did they have a lot to work with (characters and story), there was clear build up that ended with little to no pay off. At worst, the pay off were jokes that take away from MANY scenes. I suppose this is the marvel issue, but here it's tenfold. To the point that I truly believe Marvel doesn't understand that we DON'T enjoy this, or they're mocking us.

The ending tells me that either the writer didn't care to commit to character arcs or was forced to not make any major changes that would risk the character's futures. They also humiliate their future threat in a way that's still baffling.

If you want a decent story with decent character work this isn't it. If you're here for moving images on a screen to make quips, well you're in for a treat."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was better than I thought and I love the story of the bad guy
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"All over the place and an extremely messy story. Removes all the charm and emotional heart of the first two Ant-Man movies and replaces it with nonsensical exposition and randomness for the sake of being random. Gives half of the main characters nothing to do. A low point for Marvel, unfortunately."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I loved Jonathan Major‚Äôs portrayal of Kang The Conqueror and also Kathryn Newton‚Äôs performance as Cassandra Lang. This is more of a build up film to Avengers: Kang Dynasty, yet is still enjoyable."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"La verdad que esperaba mucho m√°s. La peli safa, es pochoclera. Pero se queda muy corta. Tanto potencial para hacer esto? Ant man 1 fue mejor y ten√≠a mucho menos."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It starts very fast, i was hoping to see a longer introduction BUT once they are at the quantum realm your mind will be blown by the trippy scenography and cgi. Acting wasnt bad at all, Majors is FANTASTIC. Many unnecesary jokes. Many unnecesary characters. Cassie was great for a young super hero. Bill Murray was a waste, so unnecesary character. Some things didn't make sense (for example how can cassie and scott take of their helmet when they're big? is its beacause they're in the quantum realm? there was no explanation for that). And oh lord, if this was one of the BAD Kangs.... i really wanna see the others.
Great start for the phase 5.... critics should lower their expectations... we dont need infinity war or endgame in every movie marvel does... it was great, Marvel is taking their time (ironically) to build the new MCU and the Multiverse saga."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know what movie these critics watched but as I can I though it was great! It had humor and the quantum realm was super cool and creative! It so has a great ending but leaves more of the story to be told. These critics need to have a little fun sometimes! Sheesh.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked this movie. Is it perfect ? Of course not. Is it a good Marvel movie ? Absolutly. The world building is on point, the secondary characters are almost all good. Only MODOK bugged me out, but i never liked him, in any Marvel media. He is too goofy, as it is supposed to be since is creation by Marvel tho. Majors is just perfect in the Kang role, you can feel the anger and the absolute egocentrism behind every word he pronounce, even when it's some kind or friendly words.

Solid 4/5 for me, considering the post credi scene, that leads to something huge for the rest of the Saga, for those who know what it means. ;)"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a very good start to Phase 5 of the MCU. Kang steals the show and Ant-man remains just as charismatic. The best movie in the franchise without a doubt.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jonathan Majors puts in too good of a performance for what was otherwise a goofy, not funny, low stakes movie. He acts circles around everyone. Please Marvel, do him justice in Kang Dynasty. Also, stop giving Peyton Reed jobs."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was an exciting watch. It kept the humour of the other two Ant Man films, whilst also keeping the stakes high and keeping the audience at the edge of its seat."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually fantastic, wasn't too long, and an awesome introduction to Kang."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantamania introduces one of the MCU‚Äôs most menacing villains while also setting up phase 5. While the film does have its issues, it is overshadowed by the strong plot and great character performances. It does not rely too heavy on jokes and is has a great balance of serious and funny. Overall I highly recommend this movie as it is a great new addition to the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Its the best movie after Spider-man no way home and i dont care about the critics there dumb they dont understand anything.Jonathon majors and Paul raud and everyone did a fantastic job so in my ratings of marvel movie spiderman no way home and ant man 3 are at 1st position
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Antman movie and a great start to phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the actors did really well with what they were given. Paul Rudd is the best. I enjoyed the film for what it is and was entertained, but I am glad Kevin fiege has stated that he will be focusing on quality over quantity, from this point forward, as it's what the actors and fans deserve. Regardless I enjoyed the movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing start to Phase 5. The critics are way wrong on this one.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una gran pelicula, al parecer muchos no la entendieron."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kangs introduction is every bit of what MCU fans have been waiting for. Johnathan Major's is the perfect casting for this role and the future of the MCU. Some questionable decisions hold this back from being a great overall movie though.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a fine movie. Sure it may not be great but that's ok. Some characters are not fleshed out fully. The introduction of MODOK plays for laughs, but how can you take him seriously, he is a giant head. Kang is intended the overall breakout performer. He will definitely be a force for the future MCU movies. I give the movie 3 of 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was simply awesome, funny at times, for me espectacular."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the critics guys this is an awesome movie just don't expect too much like it's not an Avengers film and you will like this movie great start for the Marvel phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was one of the better Marvel movies I've seen in some time. They set up the next phase perfectly by being heartfelt, serious and funny all at once. If you haven't been keeping up with Marvel the movie may not make sense and I think that's why there are so many bad reviews. But if I can say one thing it's to go watch ""Loki"". If you watch that show, this whole movie will make sense. Amazing and I give a 9.5/10."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Whole movie was around Kang.. It overshadowed the poor CGI for which mcu isn't known for. But the best trilogy of antman
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"outstanding, from discovering the trippy quantum realm to Kang coming on all time dictator, this was such an enjoyable ride"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was such a weird and fun action comedy that brings a new world to us with familiar characters. Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathon Majors are real standouts!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great setup for phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie post endgame produced by Marvel
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed this one more than Thor 4 or Wakanda Forever. It plays out like a Star Wars film starring Paul Rudd, which is certainly a different pace and atmosphere. But Kang is an awesome villian (props to J Majors), and the visuals are fun and appealing. For a third film about a guy who fights alongside ants, I'd say they've done just fine. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the build-up to Kang Dynasty"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good story and pacing, doesn't feel as daunting of a watch as black panther 2 or endgame. Sets the stage for the future of phase 5 and 6. It does have some wonky looking CGI at times, and the overarching story may be difficult to grasp if you are not up to date on marvel ventures. I would rate it an 8.1 out of 10 a good start to phase 5 of the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I found the family aspect of this movie was a very good touch and seeing the Loki and kang post credit just sets up this whole thing for the new avengers movie and loki season 2!! Overall this was a very well done movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than the most recent Thor installment and definitely getting us back on track for some big villains and uniting our multiverses!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Truth be told this has got to be the first Marvel movie in the past four years that was worth my time. It made leaps beyond the other Antman movies and was just genuinely entertaining. It gave back that sense of hope Marvel used to give us back when the Avengers were doing their thing. And the comedy wasn't trite and forced.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another case of don't let the critics sway you. This isn't a perfect movie, but it's an action packed, very fun 2 hours . Plus has 2 solid post credit scenes"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I would consider this a great start for MUCs phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A thrilling sequel that ups the usual insectoid antics to epic levels, Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania nevertheless maintains much of the humor and heart that fans love about this corner of the MCU mega-franchise.  Transposed from the trippy-yet-grounded realm of ""the real world, but everything looks big because our POV characters are so tiny"" to the psychedelic microverse of the Quantum Realm, Ant-Man 3 pays off what's been promised since the first film (contra the many reviewers who find this shift to be some sort of inexplicable departure), when the existence of such a place was heavily teased.  Despite the entertaining array of Star Wars-style alien creatures, the center of the film remains Scott Lang and his love for his daughter Cassie, alloyed with an appealing recapitulation of what it means to be a hero: Scott has largely moved on after helping defeat Thanos, penning a book somewhat hypocritically called ""Watch Out for the Little Guy"" while worriedly scolding Cassie for actually living up to that slogan in a series of socially-aware protests.  Thrust into a subatomic freedom fight, Cassie has to convince her dad that it's not enough just to go home; superheroes are supposed to help. 

And what threat is big enough to endanger all the peoples of the Quantum Realm?  It's Kang, at last!  Johnathan Majors delivers on the long promise of his casting as this quintessential Avengers foe, delivering a performance that is at once philosophic and menacing.  Kang has ""seen how it all ends,"" and the implications of that clearly weigh on him even as he commits atrocities to fulfill what he perceives as his destiny.  The tonal difference between Scott and Kang couldn't be sharper - except when Scott rises to the heroic occasion and resolves to do what he must to contain Kang.

There are a few pointed nods to real-world issues that are sure to delightfully ruffle the feathers of right wing assholes, and I'm here for it.  If there's a secondary moral to this movie, after ""watch out for the little guy,"" it would be ""it's never too late to stop being a dick"" - truly a message designed for the United States of 2023.

If there's a drawback to this movie, it's that there's so much going on that the title-sharing Wasp gets little to do, and any thinking person would have been pleased if Kang could have had 100% more screen time.  But the movie is zippy and fun, with well-established stakes, and sets up the future threat to the MCU without detracting from a solid and worthwhile adventure in its own right."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was it needed to be with two poingent end credit scenes. If you love Star Wars, Dune or any good sci/fi action movie you will love this. Can't wait to see it again.  If you love 3D see it like that but not necessary. But see it on the biggest screen possible."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is awesome and best of all 2023
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enrertaining. Paul Rudd didn't disappoint.
A little cheesy in certain parts. The writing needed work. But overall a fun filled movie that helps the Marvel Universe continue moving along."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie to start phase 5!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good movie from beginning to end, not as funny as the other ant man's but does a great job setting up Kang for movies to come"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It combines the humor from the previous Ant-Man movies with the amped action that we've been seeing in the MCU. Jonathan Major's performance as Kang completely stole the show. As much as I would've liked to see more 1v1 between him and Lang, the movie sets the tone for the future his character perfectly."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I have no idea what these critics are talking about.  This movie was good!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was a bit nervous going into this after the reviews I saw, but that was quite the overreaction. While the CGI was mostly awful, and dialogue cringe from time-to-time the story tracked from beginning to end and was an average MCU movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good., definitely up there with Spider-Man No Way Home, Dr. Strange, & Shang-Chi as one of the best Marvel movies since Endgame. More of a primer for things to come more than a stand alone movie but atoll very good. Worth seeing. Kang is here."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly not sure why all the hate. Yes, there was a brief mention of socialism.  It didn't drive the movie. It was action packed, visually stunning,  funny and Kang was awesome. Don't believe the hate."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's a fun time at the movies for sure and the acting as always is great but it felt like it was just there to set up for more mcu movies. Stay through the credits to see what I mean.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed the last 2 films and how rewatchable they were as they're mostly in their own bubble, but this is different and more in line with other MCU movies so it's a welcomed change at no expense to the past films. Jonathan Majors was no surprise, but Scott and the gang were pleasant as well! I'm glad this movie was used to usher in the next phase of the MCU and it has done a wonderful job hyping up the entire arena!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No explanation of Kang's motives to be the conqueror. All the movie going around who the conqueror is and no explanation of what he believes. Poor storytelling during the first hour. Great final fight scenes, Major excels on his role although he didn't get the screentime I expected. Felt like a Star Wars movie at some point (not in a good way).
Marvel is ruining MCU. When you already have the audience, you should aim for more risky proposals like DC (The Suicide Squad, Joker, Birds of Prey or Peacemaker)."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie for family and friends
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was ok, Not the kind of movie that you'll tell your friends, ""You've got to go see it!"""
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome Movie. Action in the second part of the movie is great. Post credit scences are wow!=)
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,it was very good movie.  I missed two previous characters that were in the last 2 Ant Man movies.   Luis and Kurt were missed they played very funny great characters.   It seems like what most Marvel movies lack is carry over and continuety as well as a lack of cross over from other Marvel movies or characters.  I like the fact the ending was done well.  The last 3 Marvel movies had the same basic ending of the bad guy reconciling at the end.   No wokeness in this movie which is good.   Over all a good story.  I like Cassie and Lang's character development.   Over all a good movie experience.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,completely disconnected from the real world
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Meh.  This movie didn't need to happen.  It doesn't move the MCU along at all.  Loki did a much better job introducing Kang.  Wait for it to drop on Disney+.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was awesome! There were some filler scenes but overall the story and direction was fun. After watching this movie it is clear the direct Marvel is going. Phase 4 wasn't like this. A lot of mid CGI as well.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"MAZA AYA BHAI! An important movie in phase 5 that suddenly increases your faith in the MCU. 

While keeping a feeling of balance is ideal cause CG inconsistency is visible with some narrative instability.
However it's still enjoyable. MAZA TO HAI ‚úåÔ∏è"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Really really enjoyed this movie. Good action and funny. Very Guardians of the Galaxyesque and finally have a direction that has been lacking since Endgame. Jonathan Majors steals the show.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A 2 hour Kang trailer, the CGI was not the worst I've ever seen but more consistently frustrating cause its in every shot of the movie. The Darren/MODOK stuff was ?????."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The new Ant-Man film lacks the spark of fun of the first two, but it's still awesome. The new setting fits the film perfectly and Kang is a threatening villain. I enjoyed every second of Kang's screentime. The biggest problem of the movie are the special effects. The first half of the film they're just too cartoonish!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great action so-so FX Much better than Thor 4
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good but not great ant man has a hard time  deciding how it's going to wow the audience. Cute story with some good content that just lacked wow factor
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually AMAZING! Definitely gave major character development to all the main characters and introduced our new BIG BAD well! My teen guys agreed with me and predicted a much better audience score.  ""Critics"" are over analyzing and taking themselves WAY to seriously!! Go see this in theaters!!! #MODOK"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a cool movie, but MODOK and some Cassie being the chosen-one stuff took out of the zone for some parts, but it is still better than the last to Ant-Man entries. Not top-tier MCU but still a fun film."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this is one of the best Marvel movies to be released since the end of the infinity saga. I still think spider man is the best but ant man is definitely up there.  This movie proves why Jonathan Majors is the perfect cast for Kang. Everything down to his facial movements is perfect for the villain.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm the type of movie goer who looks at movie critiques and what they had to say but I totally disagree on this one. I kept thinking I was gonna find something I was going to dislike. I loved it. The, fun, jokes, and world building...and high stakes worked for me."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love how the MCU tells individual stories that thrill and amaze, while simultaneously weaving a larger, overarching story that includes all the individual chapters and characters. 
An uninitiated audience member can enter at any point in the narrative and not feel lost, and the faithful can delight in each chapters thrills as well as the intricate threads that tie the whole crazy enchilada together. 
This movie is a great example. Theres an amazing, hallucinatory Quantum Realm that exists down in the subatomic spaces of our world. Its got cities, and people, and Bill Murray and weird animals and scary villains. Theres a tender story about blended families learning to get along. Theres humor and thrills and suspense. Theres characters we love, characters we wish we knew more about, characters we dread and even characters with ginormous heads who sit in weird floating chairs and get up to no good. 
The MCU always tries to show the audience a different look: 
Sometimes the motif is sit-coms, or horror or epic quest or spy thriller. Quantumania is a full-on zany sci-fi fun house house. It is as weird and wild as Ant-Man comics ever were. Highly recommended."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Extremely funny, easily the best ant man movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantomania. I thought it was a fun popcorn flick with the weirdness, comedy and action I like to see in the MCU. Scott Lang is charming as ever. Kang is formidable. Janet Van-Dyne (OG Wasp) is fierce. Hope Van-Dyne is loyal and badass. Cassie is adorkable. I don't think this film deserves the critic rating that it is getting. I think the new trend is to hate on Marvel like what DC suffered before. If you want a fun visual spectacle to enjoy; go see this movie. No it won't change your life, no it is not a Cinematic think piece; but It is a dumb-fun time at the theater (especially in Imax)."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"RT got this one very wrong. Great movie and great start to Phase 5. Definitely go check it out. Post credit scenes are amazing!!!
8/10"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the critics! Go see this movie. Paul Rudd does what Paul Rudd does. And Johnathan Majors brings Kang to LIFE in a major way. Michelle Pfiefer was great too. You'll laugh and be surprised throughout
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a great time I don't get the hate by the critics. I mean yeah the 3rd act was so-so but the rest of the movie was great, well except modok. The best part was Kang The Conqueror"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a fun, wonderful, and surprising story. Great journey and fun, FUN new characters. Kang is a beast! What a great way to start Phase 5!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was really boring.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not a lot of original themes or designs in this one. Character developments fell flat but Kang by Jonathan Majors has no reason being this great and being in this movie. HE WAS PHENOMENAL! Everything else felt mid and uninteresting.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme √© bom sim, claro que n√£o √© uma obra prima da Marvel mas, n√£o √© esse mostro que a m√≠dia diz. Pode ir ver sem medo."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Truly one of the worst movies ever made. If someone recommends this movie to you and days it's good - block their number. Remove them from your life. Consider having them arrested. This movie looks awful. It has literally no story or plot. And Paul Rudds entire character is just ""CASSIE!!""  I can't believe how bad this movie is. Sincerely."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was tolerable but I also couldn't wait to be over. It wasn't the worst MCU movie but It almost felt like it wanted to be. The title is misleading as Wasp has virtually no screen time or dialogue. Kathryn Newton has so much potential as an actress and was given a weak script and even weaker writing for her talent to shine. We lost the real feel of Scott Lang being the out-of-place hero but still effective. All the jokes felt forced, the plot fell flat and Kang seemed about as big of a threat as newborn puppies."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Everyone needs to stop comparing this phase of movies to the last phase of the Infinity Saga. It took 10 years to build that up, we are starting over and building again. Would definitely see this one again!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"even though it talks about the quantum realm, in this film it can be enjoyed by ordinary viewers who don't follow the MCU saga."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang is now my favorite villain in the MCU. In all his versions so far, Jonathan Majors has given performances unlike anything we've seen in this universe. I continue to be excited for where things go from here."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"ignore the critics! - This movie is tons of fun, whilst also taking itself very seriously. Most definitely my favourite movie in the trilogy, and the addition of Kang to the dynamic elevates it much more! Go see this, trust me, you'll have a great time."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Good concepts, Poor Execution.  Bad CGI.  And again the Title hero doesn't defeat his foe. A nitpick when Kang the Conquer beams people and they disappear, it should happen to the heroes too.  Only no name redshirts get disintegrated in Quantumania."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,People expect endgame level movies thats why they rate it low but even if iron man 1 released now instead of 2008 people whould say its bad. This movie was amazing dont listen to the critics go watch ant man 3
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Boy did the critics get this one wrong. This movie is easily a 7.5 out of 10 but I'd personally give it an 8 out of 10. The movie isn't perfect but it definitely works. Could've use a little more action but the end battle made up for failures in that department. Kang was done really well. There are certain things I wished they would have done to make the movie a little heavier, which would have made this movie go from good to great. Overall a great addition to the MCU and good start to Phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally! Phase 5 of the MCU kicks off with a bang as this is film is packed with a compelling story, action, adventure and tons of laughs! I can't wait to see how this story arch plays out!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had a lot of fun with this movie. Jonathan Majors as Kang was terrifying. Ant-Man and the Wasp were awesome. Hank Pym was a badass. Although I can see where the low critic score comes from, I still recommend seeing this movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Unfortunately even Kang can't save the rest of this messy film from mediocrity. Majorly disappointed to say the least.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics are wrong. It's not the best MCU but still a great watch and contributes to the overall MCU story.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don't understand the negativity Quantumania is receiving from critics and some fans. Was it a great movie? No. Was it entertaining and a lot of fun? Absolutely. And that's more than can be said for most of Phase 4. It feels like after a few serious stumbles, the MCU is working its way back to world-building and constructing a larger narrative. I hope Quantumania is a sign of things to come and not an echo of a dead franchise."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"That's how most Marvel movies should be! In the same way that Marvel comics are not made to win awards, the movie is not made to please critics sitting in their fancy chairs expecting everything to make sense (It's a quantum realm, nothing is going to make sense and that's awesome) and be as politically correct as possible.  The movie isn't the best but it manages to do what many in phase 4 have failed to do, be entertaining. Kang is amazing and I am looking forward to seeing more of him, some will debate the outcome of the final battle, but for them I want to remind them that he is not the strongest Kang, he is a Kang that has already been defeated by other Kang, the only weak point I find is MODOK and his development. In conclusion, if you are a true Marvel fan YOU WILL ENJOY IT, but if you are just looking to see Oscar winning movies or movies that seek to fulfill a political agenda, DON'T SEE IT."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great set up for Kang. Story didn't sway far off course. Can't wait to see Phase 5.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I was expecting a bit more depth, not a memorable film. I wish Michael Douglas had more screen time. Bill Murray's character made no sense."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"What people need to keep in mind when viewing this film is that it is not your normal ""Ant-Man"" movie.  This is a complete set up/ back story film.  You are introduced to Kang, given some back story, and enough story to keep propelling phase 5 forward.  It clearly should be kept separate while thinking of the previous 2 films.  If you do that, then the film is a fun, silly ride which does good to set up future projects.  While I will agree that it takes a few minutes to hit its stride, I was pleasantly surprised by the film, especially given the absolutely Ludacris critic reviews.  Talk about missing the whole concept of a ""Set Up"" movie, they have no feel for the greater scheme.  I choose to at least, for now, retain my faith that the films will keep improving as the story unfolds.  I can almost guarantee that all the naysayers will be praising the movie eventually, after the next several projects come out which tie into it.  In my opinion, very serviceable start phase 5.  Could it have been better, sure.  But it was more than enough to keep me excited for the rest of the slate."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was a goofy one, but by no means is it as bad as the critical reception. Majors is fantastic as Kang, we clearly see the direction the franchise heading, and M.O.D.O.K. was odd but kinda worked? The overwhelming hate truly confuses me."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed this film. I think it's a good, not great movie. It definitely pushes some of the Ant-Man team to the back, but it's in service of Kang - which is understandable. Wasp is barely a factor, unfortunately, but we do get a ton of time with Scott. Rudd, Majors, and Pfeiffer shine in this film. 

MODOK is interesting as well. He makes complete sense ,IMO, based on how he got there. 

This feels very much like it's own complete movie, but also introducing Phase 5. I think critics are starting to be more critical of the Marvel machine, but before i dont think this would have been an issue (Please see Ant-Man and the Wasp's reviews). I do agree with the critics that this is a disservice to a trilogy conclusion, but it's not all bad. It's just different from what really worked previously for Scott Lang."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Liked: Kang was awesome. Definitely excited to see more of him in the MCU. 

Disliked: They must have used Star wars writers because SPOILER ALERT..... this was a star wars movie.  Darth Kang.... Bill Murray was Lando from Empire Strikes back... they had the weird species and bar scenes. Kangs troops were just like storm troopers. I'm sure a real star wars fan (which I'm not) could pull even more. it felt lazy. also didn't like Scott's daughter. she was corny. thought modok was funny."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Film noioso e senza senso, pessimo inizio per la nuova fase, sconsigliato."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Majors, Rudd and Pfeiffer are the heart of this movie. Overall, I liked the movie and will want to see it again. If only it had been a little more focused though, it would have been a 4 stars for me. The stakes for Ant-Man and his daughter lacked the emotional strength that it deserved, especially as a closing chapter of the trilogy. Nonetheless, the movie was a good kick-off for the Kang Dynasty."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a big scale movie for Ant Man but retained the small scale core and heart of what makes Ant Man awesome.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,it has it's flaws but it's a fun and entertaining journey! it works really well as an episode of a larger narrative and that's what some people don't understand about it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,While the story was almost completely given away in the trailers there was still a big mystery to uncover. Every actor in the film did an amazing job especially Johnathan Majors. Marvel has a lot of work to fix their CGI issues however it looked good. Definitely fun to watch and I would definitely watch it again.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Do not listen to the critics. Listen to your peers. Very enjoyable and fun!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was really excited for this film; the trailers made the stakes seem high with a story that was somewhat mature in tone. Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.

The overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.

The dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.

The performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.

Finally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.

Overall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience. The MCU needs to pick it up this year because it is on a major downward trajectory.

Score: 52%
Verdict: Average"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie started off very enjoyable but ended in a rushed mayhem. The world building was a beautiful hybrid of Avatar and Star Wars, but led to a disappointing feeling of wasted potential. The CGI was not ideal at times, but overall kept up. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, and Jonathan Majors carried themselves very well throughout the film only lacking due to the script."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Why rating so low, it's very good movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I wanted to give a 4.5 stars cause it wasn't perfect, but I really.liked this movie way more than I thought. Ant-Man is supposed to be a weird, quirky and funny part of the MCU and this really fit.
Some of my criticism is that often the scenes were very dimly lit and the action seemed overly busy and chaotic which made it just seem like a cgi blur. A couple things were drawn out more than they should have been (Janet being open) and some slight suspension of disbelief, but that's to be expected.
MODOKs look was actually perfect. People are complaining about his CGI, but if you see the toys and comics, his face has always been distorted and weird looking. This was perfect and my theater loved  him and so did I. Cassie was great, Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors KILLED IT."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great Kang was brutal the only thing i didn't like was modok and lack of drama
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"first of all this is amazing stuff WTF was those third act brillaint '
hank entry blew me away and cassie punch to modok relally hope saving both times to scott and they are saying love you was so cute
scott cassie suchan amazing father daughter duo really a takeaway for me kang is good but he needs to more terrifed this is great for antman movie to beat the avengers he needs to raise the bar ofcouse he raised the bar they are all coming in post credits scene  great start to phase v
kevin is brillaint i cant wait to see how challenging is this  to exploring the muliverse saga this is advanced stuff mcu always nailed advance stuff told in simple and entertaing way but they have made many path breaks like that this is good this is the biggest challenge i can see the mcu and thier fans will have that glory they do not fucking stop give the best strive for the best"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible! ‚ú® That's how you start new phase, really good job Feige! Also all the actors were super talented! And CGI? Visuals? P-e-r-f-e-c-t ‚ù§Ô∏èüêú"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's not as bad as what other people say. I'll choose this over Wakanda Forever, Eternals, Black Widow and Thor Love and Thunder"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Extremely fun movie with a good balance of humor, quip and gravitas (solely for Kang). Not winning an oscar or breaking new ground but that's not why we go to see Ant-Man movies specifically. Majors stole the show and MODOK was enjoyable."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst MCU movies had a lot of potential..all the good parts were in the trailer
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was entertaining. Jonathan Majors stole the show as the menacing next big bad of MCU. The story of Janet and Kang was great. MODOK was also great. Loved the post credits scene. Paul Rudd was funny and great as always. Kathryn Newton is a great addition as Cassie Lang. All in all it is a great movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really really dont get what this whole let's check what the film critics think of films that goes on just before a film launches. Who cares what Dave from the newspaper that Noone reads any more or Jane from the BBC thinks. Films are subjective you will either like it or you won't.

I really really enjoyed this film. I'm invested in the MCU and I loved it. Is it the best film I've ever seen? No. Would I watch it again? Yes. The character dynamics are great the storyline is easy to follow fun and ties in with the rest of the MCU. It's a great film don't listen to what others have to say though Make your own mind up üòÅ"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A movie that, for all its faults, DOES stick the landing for me personally. Here is a review I wrote on Discord that summarizes my main points:
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania
7/10
7.5/10 for the improved CGI and VFX
A lot of the complaints people have with this movie are nitpicks. This movie has a pacing issue, sure, but nowhere near as bad as Eternals, and I definitely think this of all movies would benefit from a longer runtime/extended cut, as it seems like they left a lot on the cutting room floor. Jonathan Majors' Kang is an absolute force of nature, Kathryn Newton's Cassie Lang is v likeable, though still clearly in her rebellious teenage phase, Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne is a BAMF, Evangeline Lilly's Wasp's performance falls flat, definitely the weakest part of the movie, and Michael Douglas's Hank Pym seems to be having something of a midlife crisis. The real MVP of course, is Paul Rudd's Ant-Man. Corey Stoll as M.O.D.O.K and some of the ensemble cast are definitely surprising breakout performances. Don't watch this one in 3D, and if you absolutely have to:
1. Watch it in IMAX 3D
2. Go to the bathroom before the movie. Don't hold it in. Not for this movie anyway."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film is mind blowing and epic
things can get restructured but the ending fight schene is very good"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"(All puns in this review are intended). The Ant-man movies were always the smallest movies in the MCU, so i was a little scared when they announced Quantumania . It was gonna be this big, bombastic Avengers level movie, but after watching it, i was very wrong for thinking so. This is, while not the best ant-man movie, is still a solid start to this phase of the MCU. All performances were great, especially Jonathan Majors. Kang is a fantastic villain, even if he isn't written as well in the third act Modok was also hilarious, which i would say also counts for the rest of the movie. I thought that Scott and Cassies relationship is cute and they both go through semi-decent arcs. While there were problems, like weird tonal shifts, At times sloppy writing and a lackluster ending (not the final battle, rather the final few minutes), i still really like the movie and i would recommend it. There are also two post-credits scenes."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really really wanted to like it but alas, it was Very Confusing plot. Not nearly as much charm and humor as the other two ant man movies. Best thing was the last post credit scene!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly, after the third installment, Q-Mania is still an entertaining movie. It dropped several comedic performances and stars. Became a 'slightly-serious' Phase 5 opener of Marvel MCU. It will an important part of the next villain to come. It's worth watching. Don't forget the 2 extra scenes at the end!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang is the future of the MCU
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a perfect start for phase 5 of the MCU. It ties previous projects together so that a new overarching storyline is developing. I loved the movie, and so did my friends."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just as good as the other Ant-Man movies. If you enjoyed those, I‚Äôd highly recommend this one!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great to see Scott Lang up against a real threat and a great intro for Kang
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wowza, this movie was so bad I cannot even explain how boring it was. I couldn‚Äôt even stay to the end I actually left half way! I never walk out of a movie but I told myself I could not get this time back ever, so went to the gym. Snooze fest and I think this was a Michelle P movie and not Paul R."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was good, not great. The Cassie recast was questionable.  And what is it with making almost every teen age girl a mega genius that can build flux capacitors out of spare parts from the dump?

Peeps love Wanda because she had a compelling story arc and you watched her and her powers develop over a series of movies and her series. 

What happened to that type of story telling?

Enough with making peeps OP out of the gate and asking the audience to just accept it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Movie, definitely deserves a much better rating then critics are giving it. Everything from visuals to the characters and most importantly Kang was perfect. Great way to end a trilogy. Movie had even amount of comedy and seriousness. Definitely watch it for yourself and do not listen to critics before judging a movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing as always... really loved this movie
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good start to Phase 5.  Very different from ""Ant-Man"" and ""Ant-Man And The Wasp"" which could effect your opinion of the film."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"These critics are dumb!! Enjoy this movie, this isn't winning an Oscar for most dramatic picture ever written, but if you take your kids to this movie and buy some popcorn and soda, you will have some good laughs and big smiles!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I really enjoyed it, Kang is amazing and cannot wait for the future. I laughed, cried a little bit and had a good time. Ant-Man is still one of my favorite characters in the MCU. So... yeah, it's not only the post-credits, it's a good movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some parts could be better but, overall, it was a great film and a must-watch for Marvel fans."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this film is good enough, but there are a few parts of the action that are unsatisfactory, such as the scene of Cassie and Scott Lang being chased by a large animal when they just arrived at Quantum."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Suuper weird, charming, and a good time. a chilling performance from Majors"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie jonathan majors is great as kang really terrifyng. Also paul rudd was great. Overall i enjoyed it. And i can'wait to see more.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics got this one way wrong. Kang , Modok and the rest were fantastic. Best of the 3 Antman movies by far"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well I loved Quantumania. It was a fun escape to another place & I can't wait to go back. One of my biggest issues with superhero movies is that the 3rd act often devolves into an incomprehensible mess, but that didn't happen here. I was invested in each part of the final battle. I'm sure it helps that I've seen Loki, since Kang is also in that. And I've also seen the other 2 Ant-man movies. But Quantumania was a true joy. Obviously the best Antman movie, but also better than many MCU solo/duo movies. I even liked it better than Thor: Love & Thunder.  

Scott Lang is a fun, wholesome treat in the MCU, & his relationship with his daughter is both sweet & funny. Kathryn Newton played Cassie perfectly. And Michael Douglas was fantastic. I loved the quick shoutout to socialism! And then. Michelle freaking Pfeiffer. Incredible! ü§© The slow evolution of Pfeiffer's Janet accentuated her role here. And while she has clearly had work done, I was thrilled to again see her flowing gray hair. My expectations for that are low after Eternals but I love to see matriarchs BE matriarchs (vs trying to look 22).

I wish we'd gotten more time with the characters native to the Quantum Realm. But only because the time we did have was so enjoyable. Hopefully they'll be in other MCU projects. Katy O'Brian as Jentorra? William Jackson Harper's Quaz & David Dastmalchian as Veb. They were the exact right vibe. So yeah, I loved Quantumania. Escaping to the Quantum Realm. Jonathan Majors as Kang. Scott Lang being Scott Lang. And the MCU let the revolutionaries be noble. Maybe I only loved it because I'm familiar with the MCU, it's impossible to know ‚Äî but I think it's a fun escape for anyone."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fine. Entertaining for the most part. Didn't love M.O.D.O.K., but the ants were a highlight. Wish there had been a better sense of scale. Sizes in the quantum realm make no sense, so I would have even appreciated a throwaway line from Scott about being confused. That would be very in-character."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,MARVEL IS REALLY BACK....THE MOVIE HAD EVERYTHING PLOT TWISTS SUSPENSE AND MOST AWAITED THE CONQUEROR......THE MOVIE HAD ONE OF THE BEST CREIDT SCENES OF ALL AND REALLY LOVED IT...PREFER TO WATCH IN 4DX
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Majors is great as kang, excited for more of his portrayal as all the different variants, honestly not what I thought it was going to be, but was still enjoyable nonetheless. Post credit scenes were super cool, visuals of the quantum realm (all thought not perfect) were pretty cool and getting a little of kangs story in as nice"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great. Jonathan Majors carried the whole movie. Movie should be seen as starting of something major. It's a great start of Phase 5. Post Credit scene hype up the audience for future movies and LOKI Season 2. Action scenes were great but emotional scene were acted as a joke. No connectivity can be felt during emotional scene. VFX was great as whole except VFX used in MODOK. Movie looks stunning as a whole if we ignore little bit mistakes.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. If you enjoy the MCU then you will enjoy this movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It may have been boring at times but lang and really good UNFORCED humor made the movie really good in my honest opinion!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestamente, a coisa mais legal que tenho a dizer sobre Homem-Formiga e a Vespa: Quantumania √© que os efeitos do laser ficaram legais. Desde Vingadores: Ultimato, sinto que as hist√≥rias da Marvel est√£o em decl√≠nio. Mas n√£o foi at√© Quantumania que realmente me senti desapontado ao deixar o cinema.

Deixe-me apenas dizer que, se voc√™ est√° procurando algo t√≠pico da Marvel - sequ√™ncias de a√ß√£o √©picas, belos mundos CGI, di√°logos divertidos, mocinhos derrotando bandidos - tem tudo isso. Mas em termos de desenvolvimento de personagem e enredo, tudo parece p√©ssimo."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie did not disappoint. It had everything that was expected.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Lang is one hell of a new villain‚Ä¶if you believe he‚Äôs a villain that is
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Do not listen to those dim witted critics. The movie is marvelous. Paving way for further multiverse exploration. Can't wait for Loki Season 2.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una pel√≠cula Refrescante para el Ucm,Y Un Villano Completamente Escalofriante"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I actually thought it'd be a worst movie just because reading the ""especialist"" critics, but after seeing it gotta admit ain't the movie i was expecting for villians like MODOK. But isn't so bad as especialist people say. I'm giving it a 7 out of 10."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantumania is better than Avatar 2.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't get me wrong, it wasn't the greatest entry in Marvel but this was still enjoyable, visually stunning and contains one of the best villains written in the MCU. Highly recommend!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad jokes, they made Modok look dumb, nerfed Kang and some jokes gave me cringe. Also bad CGI."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dialogue and plot are dull. In many moments characters are doing things they wouldn't even have enough information to decide on. The CGI for M.O.D.O.K is just awful. Jonathan Majors, on the other hand, delivers a menacing and interesting Kang, even though he plot nerfs or buffs him according to who's in the scene."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,a amazing movie action packed all the way to the very end love it
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is not that bad, I liked it. But they made MODOK a joke character tho..."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,At first When I saw the reviews I was really worried about how the movie is gonna come out but still i watched it with normal expectations and man it was good. All I am gonna say dont believe on critics. the movie is good and it will give you as usual marvel vibes.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Bad humor, boring plot, great villain. Definitely a filler movie into the lead up of what is coming next, but hard to sit thru. "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman Goes Sci-Fi!! 
I thought This Was An Awesome Start To Phase 5!! Kang Is Going To Be A Force Going Forward! Love The Change Of Style For The Antman Movies Although Still Holding On To Some Light Hearted Humour."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know what a lot of critics are talking about. This is just as much fun as the first Ant-Man. Is it because it's setting up a story for nerds who know? Should I do what Leftisits do a claim racism because of Jonathan Majors?
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quiz√° meter el gran villano de la nueva fase en una pel√≠cula con la escala que ha tenido las dos anteriores de Ant-mam, puede ser discutible y es como lo √∫nico.que le criticar√≠a, fuera de eso....es una pel√≠cula divertida y competente, pasamos un muy buen rato con la familia y me quedo con ese agradable sabor de boca. La recomiendo a√∫n sabiendo que no es de las mejores de Marbel pero ni de cerca tampoco es una pel√≠cula mala. Vayan a verla üôåüòå"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a fun and entertaining movie and they did a great job setting up Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a very unique entry into the MCU.  A lot of reveal and answered questions from past Marvel content.  It is fun.  Kang is fantastic.   The post Thanos MCU now has a specific direction.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang takes the film and MCU to a whole new level. Funny, scary and thrilling."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania was a great, hysterical, and wholesome movie to watch. The action and vfx were pretty much good most of the time. That being said, the movie took too long to start the action, and I felt there was a lack of Kang's origin, which I would have preferred. Overall, it was an ant-man film and it delivered."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"this film is very good, and the theme raised is very interesting, namely about the quantum realm. Kang in the film is so very good to villain in phase 5-6"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't believe the critics, the movie is one of the best in phase 5. The CGI was a 7/10. It was good sometimes,  but it felt like a cartoon sometimes. There is no over amount of comedy. It was timed great. Jonathan Majors stole the show from Paul Rudd. His acting was spot-on.  There is no fake empowering of women. The women characters in the movie felt natural, unlike some previous marvel movies where the female characters were made just to satisfy the public. The movie is an 8/10. 
Note: Watch the Loki series before watching this movie for a better understanding. I think some critics didn't understand the movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I published my new episode Antman and The Wasp: Qunatumania, please check it out
https://www.podbean.com/ea/pb-dc2hg-1394b17"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie! Very different from anything Marvel has done before. Has quite a heavy Star Wars vibe and leans heavily in to the Scifi aspect, which I love. Some things didn't work, MODOK could have used a lot more polish, some CGI was iffy, but overall a good time. Kang is setting up to be the best MCU villain yet. I was worried because of the poor critic reviews, but I honestly don't know what movie these people saw because it was fantastic. Best MCU movie since No Way Home."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good. Ant man and Kang hold the movie. A couple of moments of spotty cgi but otherwise not bad.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors killed it as Kang, Michelle Pfeiffer got to stretch her acting chops as Janet! Paul Rudd was great as always! Visuals were stunning! Loved it!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the movie.. disappointed that Kang was killed.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed, a really fun movie that introduces Kang and the next phase very well"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie brings back the feelings of the good movies of phase 2 or 3 of the MCU. Does not innovates or take risks like terror/horror in Multiverse of Madness. It's a good movie with a good introduction of Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun and spirit romp of a movie. It uses ideas  from Quantum theory to construct a nonsensical plot  that is just the right kind of crazy.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved another Ant man Outing. 
Jonathan majors is KANG THE CONQUERER. 
Could've been longer runtime and it felt like ""killing"" Kang was too easy."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall i think it's a good movie. Not great but not bad either. Some jokes didn't land well imo, they were unnecessary. Plus this movie lacked some action, it needed at least additional 20 more minutes and it would've been great. But i enjoyed quantumania overall."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was very entertained by this movie. It felt rushed in certain spots and chaotic at times, but I enjoyed it otherwise. Majors performance as Kang was outstanding. Not a top tier MCU film by any metric, but far from the worst."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great. I love the whole movie and Kang
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang has conquered me
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,The film has too much humor and too much going on. They gave Jonathan Major nothing to work with. The movie wants us to believe Kangs the next thanos. All the film does is tell us. It never shows us. Rough start for phase 5.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Honestly, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was way better than I expected. I would put it above Ant-Man and the wasp."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent flick. Don't buy into the hate it's getting, make your own opinion."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"First of all dont listen to that Rotton Tomatoes Score Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania is such a great movie it is the best Ant Man movie in the Trilogy Scott and Cassies relationship is very good loved alot of some great moment we got with Hank, Janet , and Hope I Actually really enjoyed hope and Janet and hank in this movie alot but Kang while it does take a bit for him to finally show up but the moment he does this movie becomes so much bigger and it is such a thrill ride does give star wars vibes but I am a fan of that so if you have been Enjoying everything in the MCU then you will have a great time with Quantumania and you will leave the Theater Shocked great movie recommend seeing in Theaters and in Imax for better enjoyment of the film to be really immersed in that world to find true enjoyment of the Story Marvel wants to tell"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its a good opening movie love the story and how they connected to the previous projects ,Part1 and 2.  It really feels like an Origin movie for  Kang in Marvel Phase 5 . Love the suspense at the end like what happened to Kang. I give it a 8/10"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a great kickstart to a new saga. A lot of great ideas, and great visual effects. 
Paul Rudd is, as always, a great Antman. 
Can't say more without spoiling the movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought the movie was okay. The one good thing I can say about the movie is at least the CGI was not off like it was on dr strange and the madness of multiverse. The problem is that the writing of the movie is kind of all over the place. Pretty much since phase 4, the MCU has lost its way.  Hopefully, one day it will get back to the well laid out foundations and path ways story wise that made up the infinity saga from phase 1 -3."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this movie was good but nothing to special. Graphics were great and fun characters. The story wasn't built up enough tho and felt like the ending was abrupt and random. I'm giving it a 5/5 because the actors did as they were told and did their jobs great. So for that it's worth a watch and good rating. The writers on the other hand were alright but marvel needs to start really start spending more time on the quality of the films not the quantity. My complaint about this movie is things felt rushed and I was expecting more to happen. Khang was very powerful and captivating but then was just gone by ants made me sad. Like the writers need to put more into these conclusions.  Other than that johnathon majors, Paul Rudd etc. amazing such great actors and actresses ."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Disappointed had high hopes for this movie. However, the story was a let down, hardly any action and when there was action it just seemed not satisfying, the villain was over hyped throughout the entire movie but when it was time for him to step up to the plate he was a swing and a big miss, and the acting was just horrendous. Perhaps the MCU is truly dead"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good Movie the whole family can enjoy! Great action and funny quips too. Definitely gave a bit of a space saga vibe
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I found it thoroughly enjoyable. I was never bored. Visually it felt like it gave a nod to almost every sci-fi movie I've ever seen. It sets up multiversal foundations and problems started in Loki as you would expect and does it in a very ant-man kind of way.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yo this is something serious and good 
The goods in movie are : 
Kang ( Jonathan Majors performance is outstanding) 
Antman ( Paul rudds performance and charming is brilliant 
Wasp ( Evangeline Lilly's performance was great)
And other actors performance was brilliant except for Kathryn Newton
Quantum realm was beautiful
Not overused comedy


The bads : 
The CGI was off in some places
Modok character felt wasted 
Kathryn Newton performance was not good
Some side character felt useless


Overview: this is definitely something that someone shouldn't miss , this is definitely worth the watch ."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked the movie. Is totally an Antman and Wasp movie with Kang starring an awesome job on MCU.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining without pushing to much comedy, good action scenes, good visuals (except for some close-ups), good introduction to Kang (he seemed so cool and scary way different than thanos), Michael Douglas (just him nothing to add) and in general good acting."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The legacy of the MCU holds an intense grip on modern cinema. This makes MCU movie #31, and does not fall short of greatness. Critics and super fans have written the script in their heads before sitting in their seats. Go see this movie for a fair review. There are jokes that land, but certainly some that don't. Some may speak upon the mood shifts that occur throughout. Personally, I was more upset that we didn't get more answers than we deserved at this point. Many questions instead were added and also left unanswered. 
Overall, not a perfect movie, but not a bad one. Go see for yourself, and enjoy!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nothing to see here, another boring battle with a bad guy from outer space. The whole quantum layer situation is boring & predictable. Marvel has struggled to make an interesting story line since the second Thor"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing..I didn't even realize how fast 2h flew by..
And the 2 post credit scene were just fireüî•"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful, fun, it felt like the best parts of Star Wars & Marvel had a child and it was Quantumania.  Excellent story, what a way to start Phase 5"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too  many characters. Bad CG, Modok it's a Joke. And boring."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Unpopular opinion. Quantumania was actually pretty good but since critic reviews were released and a few tiktok gurus started posting hate videos, every other guru started riding the hate circle jerk on that movie, especially for views and algorithm. I don't know one person in my circle that didn't like the movie. It had everything that antman movies have had so far INCLUDING character development, which was quite litterally shoved in our face. Everyone had an great amount of screen time too even Kang, it wasn't a gor situation. The movie was super simple to understand. Cgi is good and well, theyre in the ""quantum realm"". Do these critics really expect marvel to travel to a real ""quantum realm"" to film the movie. Of course its going to be high on cgi, what do you expect? the high expectations everyone's has now since endgame release is unbelievable. Every guru critic expects every marvel movie to be on the level of endgame now. It's also funny how alot of critics aren't even criticizing the movie, but just mentioning the fact that it wasn't a good movie without any detail on why it wasn't a good movie? 95% of the criticisms were like that"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An inconsistent mess that doesn't make sense if you try to think about anything for just a second. I don't hate plot but when used like it was in the film you just end up hating it‚Ä¶

And I'm short on cash I could've spent elsewhere"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun and different entry in the MCU, that doesn't go off on a ton of random tangents, this movie has a lot to tell and set up for the future of the MCU, and does a great job of telling that story, while keeping the movie action filled and fast paced. I don't understand some of these ""professional critics"" who seem to make up their mind about a movie like this before they even see it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It rates at about the same level as Cpt. Marvel. A strong humour throughout. A gritty finale
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was fun and mesmerizing from start to finish. Loved it!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang(Jonathan Majors) saved it at last and janet's screen play is also worth watching
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The first 10 minutes are supposed to have you wanting more of the film, however, it was a tad bit dry and lacked attention grabbing interest. The acting overall was bland: Scott Lang and his annoying soliloquies; Cassie Lang the troublesome teenager attempting to make her parent proud while unnecessary; Hope's boyish haircut did not work for her; I have no idea how Michelle Pfeiffer was made to look so young, but seeing her with this appearance was probably the highlight of the movie.

Truth be told, the first 30-45 minutes of fluff was NOT needed. We're here for Kang, we want to see Kang, Kang or the scene leading to Quantumania could've been reached sooner. The lead up to Kang has the audience thinking he's this person that should be immensely feared, however, I didn't feel like that was portrayed well enough when we finally see him. Though he is very powerful, a valiant and worthy opponent, I just wasn't frightened (in comparison to finally witnessing Thanos). The time phrases Kang used were very clever, if only I could remember them!

I LOVED the idea of MODOK, but not Darren as MODOK ... although his tie in was cute and made absolute sense.

There was that point in time where I said ""where the hell is hank with the ants!?!"" It reminded me of the same type of moment in Infinity War when I said something similar waiting on everyone to come back from the blip to assist Cap in battle. I didn't like that similarity, it was unnecessary. This phase of movies should be paving its own way toward a bigger battle, not copying what was done before.

I figured we would get to see more variations of Kang in a post-credit scene, and we got just that! Rama-Tut and Immortus Kang were definitely must shows. I suppose that the 3rd Kang was possibly Iron Lad. The Council of Kangs scene was straight out of the comic books (Google it). I think the most surprising Kang variation was Victor Timely. My main wonder is whether or not we will see Nathaniel Richards, father of Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic 4) and how/if he leads into a Fantastic Four movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fantastic adventure with great humor, heroics and heart."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a good movie. Excited to see where phase 5 is heading toward.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny all the way through it, prepares you for the next big."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Typical Marvel, it was enjoyable, and Johnathan Majors stole the show."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a Fun movie which we expect from an antman movie.. Although its not a masterpiece but its way better than the She hulk which got 75% rating from the critics..
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Beep beep boop!! Lots of bots in this review!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I LOVED this movie! I'm baffled at the critics' scores‚Ä¶I'm not sure what more you could ask for, go see it yourself!  It was an Ant-Man movie, but ups the stakes significantly. A perfect intro to a totally bad-ass Kang. The audience Thursday night was hyped! I'm def seeing this again in theaters and probably several more times on Disney +"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"All I've been seeing up until Thursday is how bad this movie is, how everyone is tired of Marvel Movies. Surprise surprise, it's all critics talking. The same critics who always say every Marvel movie is a flop, the end is neigh. It just leans into my belief that critics are out of touch with what audiences actually like. I personally enjoyed the entire movie, and am more then confident to say the entire theater I was in enjoyed it just as much. I found this one to be much better then the 2nd Ant-Man. I look forward to future Phase 5 movies and shows."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang, Cassie, and Janet stole the show I loved how Paul Rudd and Kathryn Newton has their father daughter tension and relationship it felt real. Some CGI scenes in this movie felt very rushed and as as introduction of Jonathan Majors as a ""mean"" Kang the Conqueror I thought that they did really well on that. I don't know why this movie did so bad on rotten tomatoes I think that this is one of the few good MCU projects that has been released after phase 3. Also I thought that the trailer gave away to much of the film wish they kept some stuff as a surprise in the movie, but there are so many stuff that they did not show in the trailers. However one thing I did not like about this movie was that this did not feel like a beginning of a new phase it felt like a normal marvel movie in a phase because of all the set up. After the movie I had to remind myself that this movie the first movie of phase 5 and it did not feel like that for me. BUT STAY FOR THE POST CREDIT SCENES."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a brilliant movie. It had everything you want in a marvel flick. The actings great the comedy is well timed. The VFX are amazing and the story is packed with action with no bad pacing for nonsense story. Loved it. Brilliant. Will rewatch when it's on Disney+. 

Ignore the ""critics"" they are just fed up with superheroes. Cinema is a spectacle now. We have home cinema systems for a good gritty drama. The movie theatre is for the big blockbusters. 

Pure entertainment. 5*"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally, one movie that begins to link the recent shows and movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Introduced the big bad in a great way but also lacked the humor weve come to expect from AntMan
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie with great implications for the rest of the Mcu
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Thought it was great.  Dont listen to the critics.  Go see it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are wrong on this one
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I see why the critics hated it - if you're looking for a serious, thick plotted movie, you're not going to find it here. But this was one of the most fun MCU movies to watch for me. Myself and the entire theater were constantly laughing. Absolutely hilarious moments, while still portraying some epic, trippy visuals in the quantum realm. Also, Kang was awesome. What a great new villain"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,A very enjoyable movie. It's not perfect but it's still a fun movie to watch..
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I left the theater half way through the movie...
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,It is a very big mid
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was really good
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a very entertaining movie. I took my family to watch it, as a familly we all enjoyed. It has a father daughter bonding story, it has a grandma secret revile. It has an introduction to a great villan and it sticks to the comedy/ drama we like from antman"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I have had the privilege and fortune to be able to watch it on opening day in 3D. I personally mostly enjoyed it, but I found some flaws with it.

Let's get to the positives first. Majors was genuinely threatening and scary as Kang, his gravitas being genuinely scary and chilling for the entire multiverse. He has managed to be a legitimate contender to Thanos' throne as MCU's biggest villain yet. Another positive I can note is the humor. Now, I did not laugh out loud at every single joke that the film had to offer, but its heart was mostly genuine, and some of it did land. (MODOK's appearance was ironically pretty funny to me, the CGI monstrosity was... something.)

Now let me get to the negatives. If it weren't for the fact I watched it in 3D, I think it would be obvious most of the time that they are on a green screen in a CGI world. The creatures in the Quantum Realm were mostly uninspired. It was clear they had taken references from other sources and... eh. It kinda looked busy.

The plot follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) as he lives his life in San Francisco. It all starts off normally until his daughter, Cassie, gets freed from prison after she was in some sort of protest or whatever? Then they go to Hank's lab or something and they discover that they can communicate with the Quantum Realm. That machine goes wrong and they get transported into the Quantum Realm. They find their way in, learn a bunch of customs and, after drinking some slime, can communicate with whatever creatures there are in this realm.

Then at some point, Ant-Man, Hope, Hank, Cassie and all the others get separated, things go on, Bill Murray appears and is freaking cool, at some point there comes Kang, some more things happen, then it really begins to end when Ant-Man, Hope and Cassie stand alongside Kang, and Kang says ""I conquer worlds, you talk with ants"" and Hank just comes with a CGI army of ants to save the day, and then they're in some tower and the little guy has to sacrifice, then it's kinda bittersweet.

Fine plot, it works, it was entertaining, but honestly I liked what 3D could bring to me and my favorite part was when the screen went dark and he got into the nucleum and there was the Storm of Possibilities, pretty cool CGI. Entertaining, good as an introduction to Kang, but not much else. Could have been a lot better."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a good start for phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Eu gostei do filme, n√£o foi o melhor filme do mundo, mas gostei"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"JonathanMajors is a powerhouse and his performance alone is worth your ticket. Everybody cheered for kang in my theatre. Even his name got a lot of cheers.From the movement
KANG THE CONQUEROR enters, you will know that it's his movie not antman's and not certainly wasp's.I guess Because it does not feel
this pretty much sums up why critics hated it.
like an antman movie. It's
better than that.Paul rudd is amazing as usual. And lilly too. Their action scenes in the third
act are absolutely phenomenal. And also
they balanced the tone very well."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Considering the future of Marvel, this movie perfectly set up the next big bad of the MCU and shows us how menacing he is! 

Definitely a good entertainer! And a must watch for KANG! Literally, the Conqueror have stolen the show! 

Go for it Marvel Fansüëç"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Si bien la pelicula en si tiene un gui√≥n bastante meh, y algunas incoherencias sin explicaci√≥n, e quedado satisfecho con kang, Jhonatan majors la rompe como kang y las post creditos me dan esperanzas para el personaje, tal vez en una pel√≠cula con mucho m√°s peso le sienta mejor."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun times! It dragged a little in the middle. But a good ride
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too much unnecessary jokes and fancy cartoonish CGI.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's a Disney movie, not a Marvel movie. Now go and buy some merch! This movie is beneath Jonathan Majors' talent. Usually Ant Man has a lot of funny moments, this movie has a few laughs but more eye-rolls."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are smoking something to rate this film so low. It's an incredible start to a new phase of Marvel movies and shows how different the stakes truly are compared to Thanos.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Deciding to introduce the next saga's villain as the main threat in non-Avengers movies is an improvement. Jonathan Major's Kang the Conqueror needs to be feared. The charm from the previous films is absent though which makes the happily ever after ending miss at little more than it should.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Story was formulaic typical disney story. The ending was predictable and its a bummer cause I was hoping for something a bit heavier out of the ending, they added a few small things at end and the end credits to had some weight. Michael Douglas and Michelle Phifer acting was just awful, especially Mike Douglas, the characters they played added no value to the movie, could have written story without them no problems. Wasp was barely in the movie, Paul Rudd was fine, Kathryn Newton was pretty good, the character was typical , she did learn a little bit, but not much character growth she was basically same person at end of the movie. Johnathan Majors crushed it l, he was amazing üëè  ever scene with Majors was on an entirely different level from the rest of the movie. I went with son and we had a good time, if your looking for something to do on a cold holiday weekend it's worth going to see, it's a typical super hero movie and good 2 hour distraction."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Many plot holes and plot armours, underwhelming experience, while feeling like Kang is too overpowered for the ""Avengers"", considering the post-credit scene."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another amazing MCU thrill ride! Haters and critics are wrong, yet again!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is guardian of the galaxy meets Rick and morty. It is amazing! One of the better movies released this phase in the MCU. Going to change everything
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best Ant Man film there is. Kang is definitely an amazing/intriguing character and definitely looking forward to seeing more of him and potentially more variants. Overall 10/10
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the best MCU film since ""No Way Home.""  Massive scale for a microscopic universe.  I loved the creature design work.  The theater was engaged and boisterous.  Applause at the end.  I'll admit the opening night IMAX crowd is probably the exact target audience for this thing, but I can't see anyone leaving unhappy unless they're unable to process 2 hours of wild CGI."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,I expected to see more in this movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are being pretty harsh on this. Aside from some pacing issues at the beginning, I thought it was a pretty solid MCU film. Definitely the best one in a while. Probably should have been longer with more build up before entering the quantum realm, but it is what it is.

Humor was good. Action was good. CGI was good from what I saw. Not my favorite MCU film but way better than Black Panther 2 overall and much better editing than BP 2 or MoM. At the end of the day, it's a good comic book movie and sets up the MCU future well."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The first half was really good. All the character introductions were great. The second half was chaotic but entertaining and gripping. Jonathan Majors delivers an amazing performance. The mid-credits and post-credits scenes were excellent especially the mid-credits, as a person who has read the comics I was really excited. Also the post credits were unexpected. Overall, loved the movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang killed it.  Paul Rudd doesn't age and is still funny.  The fight scenes were sick.  Let's go Phase 5 I can't wait for GOTG 3.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In my opinion, the film took too long to ignite action. The actors/actresses were great but the storyline could have been more intense."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely love it, everyone and everything was amazing."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"First half was quite boring,2nd half was better but the fighting scene too many visual effect is quite messy and difficult to watch still prefer Ant-Man 2,story not funny and the villain Kang,seriously,he is not an interesting character,don't really like to see him again."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was actually really good, better than the other two previous movies and it‚Äôs another film that‚Äôs going lead to secret wars so I‚Äôm excited !"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it Kang is awesome. I still love the greats Michelle Pfeffer and Michael Douglas still got it.  Welcome back Marvel to the Avengers tone again. Hilarious moments were good and not forced Disney humor. 100 times better than anything recently released and feels at home with the early Marvel movies in epic scope. Way better than Shang-Chi which was a low in quality despite the ticket sales. This feels Marvel Avengers. Rotten Tomatoes critics got it wrong it is a wow and fun ride. Stay on path now Disney the tone is right and not overly watered down. These are not comedies, so comedy relief moments need to mild and well placed. This is an example of the right balance. Gauge nothing off these critics they thought Shang Chi was good and it is the worst next to Love and Thunder. Look at the audience score proof in itself. Please do an independent rating so we can overturn there misleading reviews. If the audience scores are over 100 they may reconsider."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,In my opinion the worst of the three Ant-Man movies. Kang just doesn't meet my expectations. The only highlight for me was the Welcome Back Kotter theme. I feel like the current direction of the MCU/MCM will force me to watch reruns of the entire Infinity saga. Hoping the Guardians can break the slump for me.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was perfect , perfect. Down to the last minute detail"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,great start of a new phase. A fun and exciting adventure. Kang was great and the dynamic between Scott and Cassie was adorable. Quantum Realm was Beautiful!! But it lacked the superhero feel it seem to much like it was trying to be funny like Guardians of the Galaxy and just didnt hit that mark but other than that must see to keep up with the MCU's new phases
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally a Marvel movie that feels important for the great scheme.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastically fun movie!!!  A couple characters left a little to be desired, but the overall feel of the movie stayed in line with the silliness of the ""Ant-Man"" movie vibe, while balancing the gravity of what Kang and his variants bring to the future of the MCU. Loved it, and would GLADLY watch it again!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I know critics flamed this but I thoroughly enjoyed it!! Kudos to the actors
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This Movie was great I'm just glad they did it like this and we see Kang's character and what he is capable of.  Ant Man and the team was good. In my personal opinion it was great and I loved it
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"such a good movie! the green screen stuff especially at the beginning was okay i guess and sometimes the acting was mid but it was so good and kinda funny. i love kang and i cannot wait, i personally don't think he is dead since scott did the same thing and went inside the core and stuff, so he's probably alive still. although i'm tired of all the happy endings in marvel, like i wish that scott and hope were stuck in the quantum realm until another time or something and they had to rule the land, but it's still such a good movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is mind-blowing, fantastic and has all the elements that fans need. Marvel is growing up with a very large scale. Every characters have their own presence. KANG the conqueror is the peak of the movie. Jonathan majors is so versatile. Don't trust critics review. The experience you will get is beyond any critics point of view. Finally the mid and post credit scenes are icing on the cake. Definitely a fest for audiences after a long long time. An insane build-up to the MCU phase 5. Avengers Kang denasty should be 10 times bigger than endgame. A kickoff start for phase 5 and way to go. Eagerly waiting what's next in the lineups."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"O filme √© bem divertido, tem efeitos especiais decentes e √© muito bonito. O Kang √© √≥timo, assim como todos os personagens de mais destaque (Scot, Hope, Hank, Cassie e Janet). No entanto, os personagens secund√°rios s√£o todos muito mal desenvolvidos, a maioria s√≥ aparece para fazer uma ou duas piadas. O filme tem muita piada, mas elas contrastam bem com os personagens, e com o padr√£o dos outros dois filmes. 

O filme n√£o tem nada de ABSURDO, mas √© divertido, bonito e um √≥timo passatempo. 
Poderia ser muito melhor, mas √© decente."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, worth the watch last couple of marvel have been poor but this film was fantastic"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really like this movie, saw it last night, KANG doesn‚Äôt seem like a Thanos level threat, BUT COULD BE with he‚Äôs full power! Overall 8/10 for me!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie! Kang is straight up terrifying, definitely felt that terror from a villain that we didn't feel since Thanos."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie. It was fun, enjoyable, engaging and huge for world building moving forward for MCU. The critics made too much bad about it. Don't read them or watch them on YouTube. Just go and watch and you will have a good time."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie is good entertaining and feels great that phase 5 start is best.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Majors does incredible work as Kang the Conqueror and captivates every scene he's in. Michelle Pfeiffer is also a scene stealer and a welcome surprise that I wasn't expecting. While this isn't a palate cleanser that the prior Ant-Man films have been, it works on being a Sci-Fi epic and building up for the future of the Marvel Universe.

Cassie's storyline could have been improved but her actress does a wonderful job portraying the father/daughter love between her and Scott Lang."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I find this movie very fun and keep me hook coz I couldn't figured out how it would end. 
I couldn't understand about low number by the critics maybe they watch a different movie hahahaha"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"THIS MOVIE SRS DONT DESERVE THIS KIND OF LOW SCORE ,LIKE HOW THE HELL?? ANYWAYS I TOTALLY RECOMMEND TO WATCH THIS MOVIE IF U ARE A ANTMAN / MARVEL FAN, BUT IF U ARENT ONE,U REALLY NEED A RECAP OF MARVEL PHASE 4~"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Banger Epic Conquering üî•ü•∂
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"After hearing the reviews from the critics I went in very skeptical and came out loving this movie.  As many have said, it isn't the best Marvel, but it was so much better than the last few.....I left thoroughly enjoying the movie and planning on seeing it again with friends.  Also, Majors was amazing and I can't wait to see where this is heading."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great for any Marvel fan. Kang is limitless 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Melhor filme da triologia, kang foi magnifico"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania was a very weird movie, & that's in a good sense. The movie is jam-packed with humor & action. The movie immediately delves into the Quantum Realm without wasting a second. The visual effects are amazing for most of the parts but, some parts were just god awful to look at.

Talking about characters, Kang 100% carried the movie. Janet played an equally important role. Scott & Wasp were equally amazing. Kathryn Newton had some good moments but some of her line deliveries & dialogues were just cringe.

MODOK & Quaz were wasted. They could've done so much with their characters. There's few clich√©s, which everyone could've seen it coming. It's obvious that they were plotting a different ending & it was changed in the reshoots. And of-course, some cringe dialogues.

However, the strongest factor of this movie for me, was the plot. Beautiful plot, bad execution. I'm really excited that Jeff Loveness, the writer for this movie is also writing Kang Dynasty. The post credits? Oh, get ready for the beginning of a new dynasty."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Felt like star wars 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it was the strongest of the Ant-Man trilogy.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite the negative reviews that the film has received, I find it quite funny and an excellent start for phase 5 of Marvel."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable lol not the best, but not the worst lol 2 post credit scenes."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie great storyline just i still dont get used to the new cassie actor it was awful watching her on the screen
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a light movie, it doesn't have a great plot but that doesn't spoil the movie. Kang is scary, Jonathan Majors proves why needs to be a great actor to make superhero movies. It references classic family adventure movies and ends with a false sense of comfort and all is well, when the real feeling is... The worst is yet to come."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think it was well paced and pushed the MCU phase 5 forward. It was a typical Marvel movie but a breathe of fresh air from some of their last releases. Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer were great and had great chemistry!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst mcu movies. The story is incredible weak. Cassie Lang is probably the worst acted character in all of marvel. The mcu has lost its magic. Very disappointed.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was skeptical because of the 48% from the critics, but I thought this movie was fantastic.  Paul Rudd is great as always and delivers some great humor along with some of the aliens and Michael Douglas.  It wasn't as good as Ragnarok, but it had some similar moments.  Kang the Conqueror is better than Thanos.  He can be defeated, but like the hydra heads two more spring up in his place.  Between Creed III and Marvel Jonathan Majors is going to be a huge star.  Fun night out of the house."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was great. It was a fun family action adventure with some decent humor. Me & my wife enjoyed it & look forward to more MCU movies.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The critic reviews of this film show why critics are useless today. Fantastic film
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Beginning of a New Dynasty üíô‚ú®
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Janet and Kang shine on this film, It also wasn't that bad like the people says but it is just an average film feels like a side story for ant family rather than a sequel of the first two."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are fundamentally wrong about this movie. Not sure if their reviews are politically inspired or an inability to move past Phase 3 and realize this is a new era, but whatever the case, they need to check themselves if they do not find this to be one of the most thrilling marvel movies to date. Top notch world building, CGI, acting, humor, and high stakes/serious performance by Rudd, Majors, et al. Don't walk, RUN to see this film and IGNORE THE CRITICS REVIEWS ‚Äî have fun!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I think critics don't know what Marvel fans like!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very disjointed with lots of plot holes with an overall lack of any character depth or progression. This was a waste of two hours.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania continues Marvel Studios path of experimentation. Yes it's a big budget superhero movie but this installment of the Ant-Man movies pivots from the previous two. It changes the narrative and how we interpret the characters we've come to know.

Marvel is building an overarching story that pays off in time. This is only the end of act one... I think people forget that. endations
There's definitely some highs and lows in this film.


The spfx are outstanding. I found myself being reminded of Star Wars at times with he multitude of different creatures and settings. Jonathan Majors is brilliant. Kathryn Newton portrayal of Cassie felt relatable and humbling.

The story seemed a bit underdeveloped and I feel we missed out on some major character development in regards to Cassie. I wish we got more of what her story was during the blip.

This movie pretty much leads directly into
Avengers: The Kang Dynasty an I'm curious to see how these characters get tied back in."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, good set up for the next phase of the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Something new in a making. Loved it, but i am pretty sure Ant-man is not capable of killing Kang he is still alive maybe in another earth or universe. His powers were pretty toned down for an avenger level villain."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Come on, it'a a good entertainment movie!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good start to phase 5 of marvel, with a great kang that leaves a lot to be desired for the future. The two post-credits were great."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this one. Kang is fantastic and terrifying.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is so much fun! My favorite of the Ant-Man trilogy. It further develops the Ant-Man story while also doing a fantastic job introducing Kang, Cassie and phase 5. M.O.D.O.K. is perfect! He looks just like I would expect him to. Do your inner child a favor and relax and enjoy! Remember critics, you don't have to be a dick--you can change."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome Johnthan Majors as Kang was amazing I can‚Äôt wait for the Kang Dynasty
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was bad just bad. Kang was good but man do I miss the old days marvel where they put effort into making epic movies not just another generic sequel. A bad sequel at that.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a subpar Antman movie,but quite interestingly, it was a better Star Wars movie than any one from the last trilogy."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Buen inicio de la fase 5. Muy entretenida y presenta bien al villano de la saga.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie they stick to the story and it was action packed ‚Ä¶ special effects where on point ‚Ä¶ Marcel is the best 
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Hated every second of it. Boring. Cringe. Not funny. Absolutely pointless.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie in the MCU.  Makes me look forward to how they will continue the story lines!.  I don't know what the critics are smoking but this was a fun moving from start to finish.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pel√≠cula es rara, complicada un poco de ver. Pero nos entregaron buenas escenas de acci√≥n, una buena introducci√≥n a Kang y buenos efectos."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I watched this in the cinema last night, and I must say that it was an enjoyable movie.

It has sci-fi/fantasy elements, with a good dose of humour that is interweaved throughout the film as per the usual Antman formula.

To be honest I think the critic's reviews should be ignored on this one.  It was worth the visit to the cinema to watch it on the big screen, and it feels more in tune with the previous phase of Marvel movies... which I have a feeling is the reason that the critics do not like it because it doesn't really confirm to some of the more woke material that Marvel has been putting out recently.  That is my opinion on the matter at least..."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was amazing the cgi was ok I see what there trying to do with multiverse kang is definitely ready to break some hearts
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, great entertainment. Loved the cast, story and flow."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Coherent storyline and great performances from Johnathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer. Quantum Realm was wacky and cool. Kathryn Newton was wonderful as Cassie. The mid-credit scene and post-credit scene are both worth it! Many terrible, wondrous things lie ahead in Phase 5!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Outside of some stylistic choices, Kang was menacing, the new take on MODOK was hilarious, and the Ant Family finally had time for all of them to shine without much bickering. I really enjoyed the visuals, pacing was tight and an MCU movie was fun again."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"ENJOYABLE FILM, MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR BRAIN, YOU DESERVE MOVIES LIKE MORBIUS AND VENOM...


 YOU ARE MEDIOCRE AND IGNORANT"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It is basically a comic book projected onto the big screen. lt's fun and whacky. I enjoyed the movie for what it is.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought Love and Thunder was bad and then this movie came out. This script for this movie is so cookie cutter i thought i was in a oreo factory. The action sequences are boring and dull and the comedy is even worse.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Che delusione,  uno dei peggiori film della Marvel."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really dont know what the critics are watching, but this movie had everything that an Ant-Man movie always had and upon it , opens up new thresholds to the broader MCU while creating (for the first time) an actual threat in an Ant-Man movie, while exploring a new dimension in the MCU. must watch if you are a fan of these superhero movies"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If I go to the cinema to watch a Marvel movie i don't wanna see a Star Wars one. Quantum Realm characterization was not so good and MODOK is one of the worst and silly characters of the MCU. Marvel Studios ruined Darren Cross storyarc....it was perfect the way it was in the first Ant-Man.
Despite it all, really liked Kang, he is a threat! The post-credit scenes are interesting and juicy appetizers for Kang Dinasty."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, I liked it more than recent MCU outings. First half felt like an explanation for what to come after. There has been a lot of world building in the first half. And those two end credit scenes are wild. Liked it too much. Fun, campy and usual MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome Movie. Must Watch. Don't depend on critics Reviews.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,great start of a new phase. A fun and exciting adventure. Kang was great and the dynamic between Scott and Cassie was adorable. Quantum Realm was Beautiful!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good One ;- WORTH WATCH
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not a great movie but very entertaining. Michelle and Johnathan put on elevated performances despite the mediocre writing.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie to satart marvel phase 5
Best movie from Ant-Man franchise"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There is nothing in this movie great. There is totally no point in making it only the post credit sc√®ne. The world is exactly the same at the end as is started. Humor was mediocre, and to straight in your face. 
Sorry for the actors and the makes, but Marvel has taken the wrong street and lost its way. There is nothing serieus anymore. No dangers to overcome, no character growth, only bad average comedy characters. I hope with every movie that they learned their lesson, but its keep getting worse. 

Back to the movie they throw every role of fysica they created in the previous movies over board. Everything is possible. So why not do this and that. It makes no sense. 
Bad movie. Maybe fun with chips on the couch and your telephone in your hand to watch two this at ones."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Eu adorei o filme fiquei espantado o tempo todo.
Para mim melhor filme do ant man.
Quando o filme lan√ßou eu pensava que n√£o ia ser bom tipo o Thor love and thunder mas ficou muito melhor ."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-man and the Wasp Quantumania was everything Thor and Love and Thunder was supposed to be! It felt very much in the vien of Ragnarok. It was funny, emotional, and action packed sci-fi movie with an amazing villian in Kang. It honestly felt like Marvel took the best parts of Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor Ragnarok, and Ant-Man and put them together. This is probably the best Ant-Man yet!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw the movie last night, 02/16, at an IMAX theater and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Film is action packed with some great twists along the way. The creative design of the quantum realm and its inhabitants was amazing, very colorful and enchanting.  Top notch cast did a great job, and the director moved the story forward merging two storylines together.    There is some humor in the film, but the film is not too humor heavy.  
The theater was mostly full and based on the audience reaction throughout, I would say everyone was having a good time.  There are two post credits, and it is definitely worth staying for both of them."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is the worst MCU movie ever. Love & Thunder and Eternals are better than this nosense and childish script and argument. A total boredom movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Marvel's Phase 5 is off to a great start
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The best antman movie so far.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was pretty cool, better than I expected. I liked the rapid switching back and forth between Ant man and the Wasp ‚Äòs perspectives. I loved Kang and Modok."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don‚Äôt care what the critics say, this movie was fantastic! "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pel√≠cula muy c√≥mica, el humor de Scott Lang es muy liviano y los nuevos personajes se hacen cercanos por su gracia y creatividad. el villano Kang muestra una gran actuaci√≥n y se ve imponente, genera expectativas para futuras pel√≠culas. por ultimo la escena post cr√©ditos engancha y eleva el hype para lo que se viene en MArvel"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The CGI on one character is some of the worst I've ever seen. 

It's the typical Marvel format. lame Jokes every min - really bad plot - Protagonist isn't really in any danger. Really bad CGI in this one."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think it was a great movie and was better than Thor 4 and Dr strange 2, idc about the critics review. The only problem is that the ending could've been better but I think it will make sense moving forward and both the post credit scenes were greatüëè"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely enjoyed the movie, it is the best movie in the ant-man triology."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was by far my favorite marvel movie since endgame, was a good adventure that sets the stakes for the future MCU"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was mid as heck
Plain movie, the villain saved the movie,the stroy itself was too damn long and boring,the fight against the main villain was amazing,screen time for the second villain was terrible he did literally nothing"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"All art is subjective.  Was it perfect?  No, but it is certainly not Thor-Dark World and Ironman 2-3 bad.  There‚Äôs always room to grow.  Although the Ant-Man films were always middle of the pack for me, what I love about the previous Ant-Man films were its change of pace, the stories were  fairly contained, the family dynamics, and of course the charming humor.  This one retains some of the humor but dials it down with the introduction of Kang.  Jonathan Majors kills it with his screen presence a great performance making Kang intriguing and terrifying.  With that said, look out for the little guy."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics had my expectations for the movie pretty low, but I enjoyed the movie . If I had any disappointments it was with the end credit scenes. Both were too short to explain themselves to a general audience. I was so happy that this movie was not another Love and Thunder. Columbus, OH Gateway Film Center"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fine. It wasn't as fun as the other Ant Man movies, which is fine as they obviously wanted to go a bit more serious, but the serious parts were also rather boring. The movie also didn't venture as much into the strange characters and Vernian environments as the trailer made it seem."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,could be much better
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I personally enjoyed this movie a lot. KANG RISES.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Divertida, entretenida excelentes actuaciones, es la primera vez que AntMan se enfrenta a un villano como Kang sin el resto de los Avengers."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great from start to finish! They was no side story nonsense and went straight into the action!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Go see it for yourself! I enjoyed it, I don't get the bad headlines."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Never listen to the critics!  It was fun and intense; perfect balance of humor and action.  The end credit scene...holy molly!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was fun. If you expected it to be the third Antman, then you will be disappointed.  If you go into it as a great syfi movie, then you will be entertained."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a marvelous wild ride into the QR. while not perfect, I had a lot of fun. Scott and Kang stole every scene they were in, love how they expanded Janet's character and backstory. The QR is a place I want them to revisit, just love the look of it. Really enjoyed what was setup for the future and the tie in to past movies. I have small issues with the ending and stuff happening offscreen or they not fully explaining something's, but I still enjoy and luv what we got."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,So this is just my opinion but I thought this was probably the best Marvel movie since No Way Home. I really did enjoy it. It's certainly not with its faults (MODOK‚Ä¶just why!) but all in all it was entertaining and didn't feel I wasted the money on the ticket. It was also the first time in a long while that I'm excited about the future with Kang. It's a good popcorn movie without any messaging.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't what people were expecting from it , but it's really a perfect  start for kang Dynasty"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"At times it does feel like the story is being stretched and dragged on but outside that and the amount of insignificant side characters, the movie is a blast with great action and special effects. Although most early reviews negative, this is definitely by far the best the MCU has done in a hot minute. Overall it is a ""good"" movie. 

P.S. Kang is a gangsta and easily the best character in the current MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania was a phenomenal movie. I really enjoyed it and also thought it had good humor. The jokes didn't feel forced like in the other MCU projects. Quantumania had a well written story, good director and producer. A lot of good actors did a great job with their roles and the villain of the movie was awesome, Jonathan Majors did a great job as Kang. After watching this movie, then it's not worth listening to what the critics said about Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, I hope most people will enjoy it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania was a fun movie filled with a perfect balance of humor and seriousness. Unlike other attempts to mix comedy and superheroes, Quantumania manages to combine them in a way that is satisfying to watch. It was an enjoyable experience that I feel truly added to the depth of the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was what I expected. Great beginning to the next phase of the MCU
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's fine, worth the watch."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvels first film in phase 5 is unfortunately in the end a bit of mess and surprisingly low stakes. Despite  a great performance from Jonathon Majors I did not think overall that  Kang was that dangerous. 
In the first act and part of the second I did like it but I thought that the third was all over the place. And additionally a certain marvel character  is introduced in this and he looks absolutely awful and is a bit of a joke character. And I really didn't think he needed to be in this."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great visual, decent storyline...

Perhaps critics haven't watch Loki to make sense of Antman Quantumania?"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"- Jonathan Majors stole the spotlight
- I loved the sci-fi feel and the weirdness
- it feels like the first real step forward in the new overarching plot of the mcu
- the family dynamics of the Langs/Pym/Van Dynes was great (even tho the very limited time)
- I thought the tone was quite balanced 

- the movie felt quite rushed, the characters had very limited time, Hope's presence felt most unnecessary and she could've ""stayed at home"" 
- some plot points and character decisions are questionable, but can be explained with ""arrogance ü§∑üèª""
Overall had a good time and will watch it again."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ok , unbiased opinion here, this is a movie technically , its not the worst thing ive seen but what a mess and waste of money , actors mostly did there job but what they were provided with was not good, i dont need to watch this movie again"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was the best of the 3 Ant-man movies. In saying, this movie was still not that great. MODOK seemed to be thrown in just to say he was there. He was not done any justice and was basically a joke. Kang carried the movie. Without him, this movie gets no stars. The storyline flowed well enough and the plot made sense but this was a snore of a movie. I like Antman but his stand alone movies are afterthoughts."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and storyline. Sets a great mood for the upcoming films‚Ä¶
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good one better than any new mcu movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie, with stunning visuals and the cgi and vfx were incredible. The post Credits Scenes tholo.. those were the highlights of the movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is masterpiece For action, Adventure, Sci fi, Lovers"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good balance between the family comedy and the seriousness.

MODOK is great. Kang is greater. And I like Ant-Man more after this film."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Marvel is back with a bang üí•
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Better than most Marvel products from all of Phase 4. It was an average film but had some fun and action in it along with scenes that can be appreciated. Factors such as these mentioned make the movie a bit better than just average to me. Slightly bogged down by how the second half of the movie seemed rushed, amongst other things. I appreciated the ending to some degree, and did not feel apathy, unlike other recent Marvel projects and Sony projects such as the Venom movies for example."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movies is great and entertain
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great experience from beginning to end, I thought everyone really stepped their game up for this one"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"the quantum realm looked really great as an underlying world, it was wholesome and sometimes even a bit sad. great characters, action and god damn this jonathan majors. :)"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Just an absolute fun time at the movies.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn't love every THING about the movie. But I did love the movie. I had fun. I had laughs. Jonathan Lee Majors is a hell of an actor! So.... 5 stars.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great. Scott was funny, Kang was menacing. I don't get the hate."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"√â um filme de super-her√≥is e segue a f√≥rmula habitual. De qualquer forma, f√°-lo de forma apelativa, com cen√°rios fabulosos. O MODOK deixa um pouco a desejar a n√≠vel gr√°fico, mas como personagem tem a sua piada. Jonathan Majors e os veteranos s√£o o melhor do filme. Segue a linha dos filmes do Homem-Formiga, com um tom mais c√≥mico, acrescentando algo mais de drama do habitual."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Without saying much, I can only advise you to not follow the Rotten Tomatoes critics rating. The movie is a pure theatrical entertainer. The critics giving 48% to this were probably high or not well paid. Thank You!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Scott Lang as Antman has consistently been my favorite MCU superhero and this is no exception. The relationship he has with Cassie is one of the best father daughter dynamics I've seen in film, going across three movies to show just how alike they truly are. For better or for worse. Rudd, Pfieffer, Majors, and Newton give standout performances in a sci-fi epic that gives the MCU clarity in its trajectory while still being an engaging individual story for our favorite ant family!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is the movie perfect? no, is better than Black Panther Wakanda Forever also no but is it wildly entertaining YES!. In fact it was a huge improvement on Doctor Strange 3. Yes I went there. Kang is the best on screen Marvel villain and Jonathan Majors could every well be a super star. I really don't think the critics got it right with this one."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was good not fantastic . Story was predictable , acting was good and CGI was amazing. It is a one time watch film."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics rating this so low is weird. It was great.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fantastic to watch. Full of action. A decent Kang introduction with some chilling moments. Never believe Critics score on RT.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw ant man 3 and IMAX on Thursday for the 9:30 showing,"". movie had great pacing. It does feel like it ripped off Star Wars a lot. The CGI wasn't all that great, but Jonathan Majors gave a great performance, and they tied up a lot of loose ends from the first movie! Modok was hilarious Wish they would've spent a little bit more time exploring Kangs backstory and origin!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Seems Marvel didn't learn their lesson. 
Everyone except Kang likes to throw jokes at you. I know that Scott Lang is a funny guy but this time his humour shrank to the quantum level. 
And yeah the first 15 minutes of the movie is just ""Quantum, Quantum realm ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.""  
A good villain makes a good movie and this time the villain was good but they nerfed him because good triumphs evil all the time. 
At this stage I feel like I am watching Fairy Tail where 2-3 good guys team up and defeat the bad guy and they win eventually. 

Props to the creative team for world building in CGI."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly I enjoyed the whole movie, also if you don't see him dead, he's not right
But yea, wish it was 30 mins. longer"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was heartbreakingly bad. Jonathan Majors does a great job with Kang, but it's just a shame it's in probably the weakest MCU movie to date, tied at the bottom for me with Thor: Love & Thunder. The writing is awful. The humor is terrible. The visual effects are atrocious. Kathryn Newton as Cassie is ... I don't want to be mean, but she's outright bad in this movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great visuals . Very trippy. Must see in 3D.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,it was a good experience i liked the movie and i personally liked the quantum exploration.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was good, not bad as critics rated. But climax was bitta weird for ""Kang The Conqueror"". Was it worth to spend 650 rs for this movie in imax, Yes but thank God I did not buy popcorn, that wouldnt have worth it. But end credits was damnnn awesomeüëåüëåüëå"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-man and The Wasp: Quantumania is completely different from the previous 2 Ant-Man entries. The first films presented the concept of our hero shrinking and growing by showing us the scale of everyday objects which grounded the movie and gave us enjoyable heist-y fun. This movie is almost completely cgi and while the world building is creative it can be very overwhelming and at times feels like it lacks weight. We jumped straight into the plot and had to rush into exploring the quantum universe which had some decent looking, stranger things quality shots but seriously lacks when you think about how great the cinematography COULD have looked if we focused more on our characters shocked with the world around them. It was made even less believable by the lack of awe from any of the characters. Everyone seems to be having a great time and cracking jokes besides Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors, who both give great performances. Paul Rudd is enjoyably entertaining as always but Kathryn Newton is not convincing as Cassie and delivered all her lines like she reading off a script. This was surprising because she's great in other roles. This made the movie seem to lack danger and even when the ending tried to raise the stakes you feel no sense of fear as the heroes pretty easily swat away another faceless cgi army. Overall, if you want to enjoy this movie you can, just don't expect much more than a fully cgi world with meh jokes, A LOT of exposition, and bland performances (besides Majors). Besides a great villain to look forward to in other projects, not a memorable or impactful entry for the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good after no way home it is the best one ,JM as Kang is a treat to watch. Paul Rudd is always good."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman 3 is a much needed darker toned chapter in the Antman franchise, while never sacrificing what makes the Antman franchise what it is. With committed performances by Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer, genuinely dazzling action scenes and dark meta comedy sprinkled throughout, Antman 3 is the perfect and appropriate start to phase 5, and an appropriate continuation to Scott Lang's story."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the best film in the trilogy. 

While the greenscreen nature of their shooting is sometimes obvious, that's EVERY marvel movie these days. 

Every character shined. If i were to make a single change to the film, I'd cut Bill Murray and have just a little bit more KANG."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,After seeing the critique reviews I was really worried but tried to forget the bad reviews when entering the theatre. This film was better than I thought. I love the action and the comedy. I am so surprised about the ending! Love the acting of the actors and the VFX of the movie. I can't wait for the future of the MCU!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was brilliant and it only excited me more for whats to come in the MCU. 

Sorry Rotten Tomatoes but your poor score was in and of itself a poor score."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie! Don't really know why it got such poor reviews. If you still love the MCU you are going to love Quantumania.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man Quantumania is not a perfect movie and not a close to the Ant-Man Trilogy at all. it's setting up the terrain for Phase 5, this is movie has its floss and bad moments but those moments are erase by the performance of Kang The Conqueror! JOHNATHAN MAJORS STEALS THE SHOW BIG TIME, you can feel the threat he is and what he can do for the future of Phase 5-6! Ant-Man Quantumania isn't perfect but it's one that you NEED to watch!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as the critics said but in spite of the good acting, it felt like Ant Man meets the Rise of Skywalker and Kang felt like a one movie villain instead of the next Thanos."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Quantumania left me disappointed. So disappointed, I had to make an RT account to express it. I love Marvel, Paul Rudd, the universe that's been built, etc etc. 

However, Majors' fantastic, as well as, intimidating portrayal of Kang, and slick CGI wasn't enough to prevent the cringe/corny ""We can do this, guys!"" type of dialouge and humour. Nor the outdated plot points where the stakes don't feel as high as the story wants it to be.
It's surely possible to have commercial success without compromising maturity and high stakes in a story, right? I hope Marvel and/or Disney, can see that as the new phase progresses.

Next time, Marvel. I still believe."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics were expecting Citizen Kane on this one. The movie delivers on its own, it is not pretending  to be as heavy as Wakanda Forever or Winter Soldier, it is Ant Man!! Go and enjoy it by yourself. MODOK is freaking awesome. Great world building as well."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Felt like there were some glaring issues with the setup of the story, specifically Janet's omission about her time in the Quantum Realm. As a father, I appreciated and enjoyed the relationship Scott and Cassie have. Kang's power is only second to plot armor."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just watched the film. To be very honest, I loved the movie. Absolutely loved it. The Ant family chemistry, the quantum realm characters, the story build up and KAAAANG OH MY GOD! The film definitely has a few flaws, but overall it's super enjoyable. 
Idk why critics chose to give it so poor rating but I felt like watching a 'marvel' marvel film after a long time."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bloody hell. Why‚Äôd you got to make that MODOK cheeks scene. Movies now scars me to death.. Still better than Thor 4, I guess.."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing , Marvel never disappoints, i cant wait for whats to comeüôèüôè"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I suggest not to believe in the critic reviews as they might've gone with too much expectations. But this movie was as great as any other previous Ant-man movies. We need to understand that this is just the beginning of Marvel's Phase-5 which gave us a brief idea of the future stories with Kang being the new villain. All the cast were amazing including the supporting characters introduced in the Quantum realm. It's like Marvel meet Star wars kind of vibe in it. Highly recommended üëçüèª
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"the movie was fine,i Think these "" critics "" have high expectations of movies or i dont even know what is, i need them to explain that to me .
 i Will never comprehend why the movies cant be accepted for what they are they try to make sense out of a fantasy movie. i mean its a comic movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a lot of fun! We get to experience a side to Ant-Man new to us. Effects were great and detail to even the background characters were fantastic. Really does open up the plot for the next phase. Majors was phenomenal and his micro-expressions really made the film for me.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I Loved it, it was a fun Journey."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the film a few hiccups here and there but overall great.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,The story is made for kids between the age of 8 and 12. Most of the scenes are cringe af and common sense is non-existent.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a blast. The critics are full of it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie who kick start the 5th phase of the MCU . Jonathan Majors performance is chilling as Kang the Conqueror and outshines the rest of the cast!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's great start to phase 5..
Loved the performances and a fun ride with some seriousness that MCU always needed"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite the negative reviews, I believe this film is worth seeing. This film is neither the best nor the worst. The cinematography was good, but the CGI still feels kind of rushed. The Wasp characters look like supportive characters. But I'm glad that Janet's backstory has been explored in this movie. The Multiverse's explanation in this movie is perfect. The relationship between Scott and Cassie is already good, in my opinion. The final battle is good as well, but unfortunately, the battle between Scott Lang and Kang was too fast. But, unlike Thor: Love and Thunder, I appreciate how serious Marvel Phase Five is right now, with no unnecessary cringe jokes in this film. Last but not least, the post-credit scenes are perfect. All of the actors' performances were great, especially Jonathan Majors, who is the perfect choice for playing Kang the Conqueror.
Overall, it's the most important movie that could lead into Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. So I'll give it an 8/10."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Kang carried this movie. Would not have enhoyed it, if he wasnt in it. But damn. Jonathan Majors is great."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"love it, great movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was such a great movie, not just a great Marvel movie but great movie in general. The pacing was amazing with amazing visuals and action. The story gets going within a few minutes of the opening titles. Heart, humor, action, thrills - all very well done. 

It has all the charm of the previous Ant-Man films but wow - Jonathan Majors delivers a stand out performance. Many twists and turns and solid script too. Well done for a fantastic opening to phase 5. Two end credits so stick around Marvel fans‚Ä¶they are big!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is good also they have a fun stuff the story line is not that dark but i guess its because its focuses how to open phase 5.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,came for kang and wasn't disappointed I can't wait to rewatch it
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,That was a great movie!! Marvel is doing some nice job with cgi
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best of the Marvel movies when compared to all of Phase 4.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was fantastic, although I don't understand the criticisms from some individuals. While the CGI was impressive, it could have even greater potential. Paul Rudd's portrayal of Antman was truly remarkable, and Jonathan Majors was a perfect fit for the role of Kang. Although Kang's character may have appeared slightly underdeveloped, overall the film was enjoyable."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Modok facial graphics are so awful that it just about ruins the movie. Worth going back for for Jonathan Scales and Michelle Pfeiffers performances. If they edit the movie to delete Bill Murray's scenes, even better."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A more traditional super-hero epic, wrapped up in gorgeous quantum sparks and heavy Star Wars vibes (Anyone else feel like we were in a galaxy far far away at times?! Cantina's and creatures galore. Loved it!).

Visually wild with a striking score and a terrifying villain. Performances were spot on from all the cast, but Major's was absolutely magnificent.

Whilst being absolutely bonkers inside the quantum realm, the story is a lot more straight forward than previous MCU entries.

Killer introduction for Kang. Continued fun times for the Ant-Man series. Phase Five is officially kicked off with a bang!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,best of trilogy an the first 2 films were just awesome
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie feels like it was made by an AI that was fed every Star Wars project that ever came out and was told to make an ant-man movie, but I guess that's what hiring Rick and Morty writers will get you"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stunning visuals all the way through. A quantum realm that has been developed into the universe that it is with all its variety and new characters.
The introduction of The Conqueror displays him as an absolute menace that is definitely on another league as ant-man, and leaves us wanting more (a lot more).

The tone of the movie is not static and frequently ranges from the goofiness we expect from past Ant-Man movies, to very sweet father-daughter moments, to the really scary (although charismatic) presence of Kang. 

As a standalone movie, Quantumania is very entertaining with its mesmerizing atmospheres and fun fight scenes, while as part of the MCU it definitely shows us the turning point of the much larger picture and the threats that are to come."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite some plot flaws and poor CGI (like modok), I genuinely liked it! It was an entertaining movie. Kang deserves more OP features, like Thanos did!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Multiverse Saga Kangüî•
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Johnathan Majors was incredible. Paul Rudd was charming with great comedic parts, but also digging deeper into some emotional scenes. Every scene with Scott and Kang had a real tension to it, and were my favorite parts of the film, followed closely by Cassie and Scott's. I am a bit conflicted about Hope's story though, as she felt sidelined a bit, but yet she came to Scott's rescue multiple times to save the day. 

All in all, loved the film. It's probably my favorite Antman, although I would've loved a Micheal Pena scene added in somewhere. (Possibly in the beginning or end of the movie) Looking forward to more Kang in the rest of phase 5!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just reaffirmed how critics don't know nothing.
Was it the best Marvel movie ever? No.
 Was it thoroughly entertaining and a great set-up for things to come? Absolutely!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was funny, beautiful to watch and sets up the next phase of the MCU perfectly"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"enjoyed it, lots of fun scenes and action but in a total it doesnt really matter for MCU"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's great. The first half is not that great but the second part was somewhat good. MODOK was wasted. Kang and Scott characters were good. Wasp was underutilised. The post credit scenes definitely teased the future projects.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a treat for every Marvel fan after a long time. Kang is absolutely amazing.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It wasn't the worst Marvel movie (that title is reserved for Love & Thunder) but it's still a stupid, unfunny Star Wars ripoff with no stakes and bad acting. It was entirely an exposition dump on Kang, who isn't even that scary of a villain. I'm not sure how we're supposed to consider him an existential threat. Add some weird-for-weird's-sake humor, one dimensional characters, and some horribly cringe moments, and you get a Marvel movie that's a microcosm for the current MCU. Massive budget, bad plot, occasionally funny."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I recommend this movie. It's original, better than thor 4 and successfully sets up phase 5 of MCU. I would rather tell the critics who didn't enjoy this film, to see it a step in MCU and not compare it to other antman movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I find this movie the best out of the trilogy somehow Jonathan Majors is a hella of a actor threatening when he has a scene, Scott Lang is probably better here especially when he interact with Cassie , It's Good"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I was hoping that marvel whould learn from there past mistakes But did they no they didn't kang the conquer looks awful and storyline is a mess everything is a mess
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The fights were boring, most of the new characters were so uninteresting, the story was all over the place, Kang was cool tho

Just wait for Disney+, y'all. Your time is more valuable"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the film, they're was lots of humour that didn't distract. Michelle Pfifer was awesome,  Jonathan majors was fantastic."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"i find this very entertaining, the whole star wars/lost in space style really beautiful!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I just left the movie theater and I had so much fun watching it!!! It was a great movie to watch with my nephew and some friends of mine. We had 4DX 3D seats and the experience was phenomenal! I left wanting more backstory of the people that live in the quantum realm and I wanted more of Jonathan Majors as Kang! He was so good! MODOK was pretty freakin hilarious. Cassie was a cool addition but she felt forced at times. Scott Lang aka Antman felt like he had some character development even though he's an already established character. Wasp felt more like a sidekick and used to progress the plot a bit. She could have been used more. Jane felt like a main character alongside kang n antman but great acting on her part. This movie at times felt like what current Star Wars should be which is a bit ironic. Great sci-fi elements with some Rick and Morty vibes thrown in. Not sure where the hate for the movie is coming from. It has humor and more serious tones that compliment each other. I for one can not wait to see more of Kang and how he brings the MCU to its knees. I highly recommend this movie unless you have a problem having fun and take yourself too seriously.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So listen... I'm not an objective reviewer of Marvel movies. I accept that. I see each movie or TV series as an individual issue leading to an annual Avengers type book. I don't see them as bad or good movies, I see them as pieces of a larger story. Maybe a movie or show speaks to you more than others. 

That being said... if you think you can watch these movies independently from one another cuz one may not fit your taste and you can keep up with the singular narrative they're telling... you're gonna be frustrated. This Ant-Man issue can be seen on its own but if you haven't seen the first one or the Loki series... you're gonna be somewhat lost.

These movies really aren't for adults in the way some or most people want them to be. I enjoy them because I'm a fan. I enjoy them because this is my bag and always has been. I poo-poo DC cuz of the choices they've made over the last 60some odd years where we could've had a Justice League movie with Michael Keaton, Linda Carter and Christopher Reeves back in the 80s but noooo... you know what? That's off topic.

Ant-Man is fine. It tells a story. Shows you Kang in all of his evil glory. And now we move on to Loki season 2. Dassit."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,My honest opinion on ant man and the wasp quantumania.So let get this out of the way and say that the critics are wrong about the movie and that it's actually really great and an awesome start to phase 5 of marvel.Dont go into this thinking it's the next end game think of the movie as part 1 of what's to come for marvel down the line.Make sure to stay for the post credits scenes 1000 percent worth the wait and will get you excited for the future of marvel!!!!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors as Kang was absolutely terrifying and amazing!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Were critics paid to give bad reviews? Or did they watch even the same movie? Just came out of Hall, and damn this movie was tooooo good. Solid 7.5/10
It'd have been 8/10, but deducted .5 for 2-3 jokes. Other than that, This movie was just too good. Visuals to everything."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a great Movie. The visuals were great, Kang was awesome. I thought the movie did a great job of setting up Kang as the next villain for the multiverse saga. I didn't really care for M.O.D.O.K., especially towards the end. Overall it was a great movie, some humor, and I felt the stakes."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Brought the craziness of the big bad but also the humor of Ant-Man. Only sad thing is they wasted MODOK the same way they wasted taskmaster imo. Still highly recommend and it‚Äôs one of the better movies of phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"At the dawn of MCU's Phase 5 this is a Excellent start and now the unexpected things are going to be turning up. In my Experience, this movie setup bigger plots for the future and I love Marvel Studios ways of story telling. This not about only Antman or Kang but it is the journey of Multi-Versal Saga.

Loving and looking forward for all the bigger adventure Marvel Studios has planned. The most loving part in this movie was the Cenimatic Experience and the Quantum Realm just comes to life. It looked so real and the CGI was perfect in all part. Kang was the best in his character, love the way Jonathan Majors played Multi Player Roles expecially the way he delivers Kang is astonishing and outstanding badass villain ever played. I bet this is the most challenging role in whole Marvel Cenimatic Universe because of the diversity and different philosophy then most of the characters. All together I loved the movie, all the characters played justice to their roles but Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors are the show stealers. Wow want a experience. Love you Marvel and all who contributed, makes my experience a must watch and much appreciated in all times."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a great beginning of the phase 5, Jonathan Majors is awesome as Kang, I wanna really see more of him in the future, stay for the two post-credit scenes they are very important."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Johnathan Majors absolutely nails his performance. Great story and world building. I was sad when it ended because I was torn from the amazing visuals the movie provided.  I was immersed. A great start to phase five and entertaining in every way.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is WOW...! 
Jonathan Majors's performance is exactly what was expected. Paul Rudd is as always great, and the rest of the cast is filling the gaps.

Now, bring back RDJ...! [even for one Avengers movie...]"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a great entertainer with some flaws in screenplay and VFX, Jonathan majors rocked as kang the conqueror
üî•üî•"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's the same Marvel movie for some time now, the Hero who has a son, daughter or disciple who for some reason already knows how to do everything, the son makes a mistake and almost gets everyone killed, and the hero who teaches him a lesson in in the end.  
Only the last 5 minutes of the movie are worth counting the post credit scenes.  
My recommendation is that it is an unnecessary film that if you don't see you don't miss much."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"While I feel it needed more time to flesh out some aspects, the movie was a highly enjoyable and exciting chapter of the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantomania is a blast the whole time. The pacing does get slow at time but most of the time the pacing is quick and everything is quick to the point. Paul Rudd and Kang are the stand outs in the movie. MODOK is hilarious. The score and the visuals are beautiful. You can tell they actually used ILM  in the movie. I liked how the movie is serious when it needs to be serious and also when they do make jokes the jokes are actually funny most of the time. Kang is easily one of the best villains in the MCU and almost as good as Thanos. I enjoyed seeing and exploring the quantumrealm and would love to visit it again. For fans of the other Ant-Man they will enjoy some cameos from past movies in the newest movie. I would rank the Ant-Man trilogy starting with Ant-Man 1, 3, and then 2. I rate this movie 86/ out of a 100"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,not sure of the hate.. it is a good movie..
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really fun adventure, Cassie was annoying though"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,A green screen clunker
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Faltou o desenvolvimento melhor doas personagens, o principal poderia ter amadurecido no processo de tudo que fez at√© hoje e atropelaram a hist√≥ria, Fora que guerra triste üò¢  contra o kang deu nem tempo de ter afli√ß√£o ou qualquer emo√ß√£o, o que tinha de bom no filme era efeito visual (exceto modoc)"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining and funny.  Just like an Ant-Man should be. Its rewatchability factor is high. KANG is here and he's terrifying.  Jonathan Majors is everything, the villain the MCU has needed.  Someone to love and hate and center an entire phase around with incredible depth.  Michele Fifer could put on your cat woman suit today.  Like Paul Rudd she has not seemed to age.  The world building leaves you wanting more of this realm.  Anybody else get SAGA vibes?"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Truly enjoyed the adventure and ending.  great comedic moments.  Did miss not having the X-Con business partners in the movie.  Worth watching again.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Started off pretty good, but this definitely wasn't the movie that it was marketed as being. Cassie was very annoying and unbelievable as a super hero and the movie just became a slog at the end. Not enjoyable."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had pretty high expectations for Ant Man with a villain like Kang to set up a new phase and it met my expectations in many ways. I really enjoyed the movie it has a lot of humor but also was able to let the serious moments when there were be serious. I stopped looking at the critic reviews because I don't believe marvel movies were really made for them or the pseudo intellectual it's meant to just be enjoyed, bring you excitement, make you laugh feel for the hero and hope he pulls through this movie does that. I've been a fan of the Ant Man movies always felt like they were underrated and this movie is just another of the trilogy I can see myself watching again and again. Are there some plot holes? Sure but literally every movie does. Would highly recommend seeing this one seems like a universe that's going somewhere and also this movie really sets up a lot for the next phase. So if your a marvel fan and have been following where this story is going it's a must see."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Honestly M.O.D.O.K was the best part hands down ! Movie was decent not the best but not the worst. I will say it‚Äôs better than Thor love and Thunder.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Although the visuals are good and all but since this an MCU film that is tasked on pushing forward the arc of Phase 5, this movie fails on that task while proving you a entertaining, yet forgettable, popcorn flick that you can enjoy if you can ignore that this is SUPPOSED to introduce the new ""big bad.""

Do you need to see this immediately? No. You can wait for it on Disney+ but I will say it is better than Thor: Love and Thunder and the jokes land better than GoTG Vol. 2 but by the end, you won't remember any freedom fights' names or FEAR Kang in anyway. 

Is the finally falling off the MCU machine? It is certainly rusting at this point."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it a lot, but I felt something important like someone dying. And the resolution to the final was forced."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best MCU drop since Spider-Man: No Way Home. Just perfectly delivered.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great I just hated the daughter and damn decisions but I loved the pink translated dude so funny
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good ending to the trilogy had humour story and introducing the next big thing KANG.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Today critics have quite impossible expectations. The film was well structured, everything made sense to me.
It had weight. You can feel that something unstoppable is coming, and the film showed this 100%. Not an Infinity War or Endgame level movie, but No Way home.

ps: It's funny if several new alien species appear in a movie, it's a Star Wars knockoff."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, the visual effects are amazing. The plot is entertaining and meaningful enough. Great preperation for the future of MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was absolutely fantastic. To all the toxic Marvel fans and annoying critics that want every Marvel film to be the same formulaic and serious tone that YOU crave. To all the people that can't just have fun using your imagination and have a good time the way these comics were meant to be enjoyed. I Just have one thing to say to you‚Ä¶
""It's never too late to stop being a dick."""
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathon Majors as Kang !!! ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èüí™üèΩüí™üèΩüí™üèΩ Phenomenal
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I watched Ant-Man yesterday. I don't think everything is as bad as the evaluation. This movie is good. Quantum world is shown very vividly. You should watch movies with 3D IMAX format to admire all this world
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The characters each bright something to the table every time they were on screen. Janet, Hank and Hope had an amazing dynamic and each of them had carried each other with the relationships and they showed what their purpose was in this film. Scott and Cassie really had an amazing dynamic among the two that cannot go unnoticed. Kang was of course amazing! We got a taste on his back story as well as his purpose with his history with Janet. The contrast from the real world to the Quantum Realm was really thought provoking and creative. This isn't like the other ant man films and honestly that is definitely okay with me! I think that is what makes this movie special. I would definitely rewatch this movie. Obviously the critics don't know what they are talking about because this movie was impactful! Remember keep an open mind and accept the changes and adventure. This is supposed to be more of a mature film which I thought it handled well!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great start to Phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love the movie and seeing kang and his variants made it great, just wish that the story would have been more darker and that kang should have won so that the audience would see how threatening kang is, Johnathan majors did excellent playing kang."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,What an amazing movie!! Don't listen to the critics go give this movie a try!! Its a great movie!! Not the best Marvel film but definitely the best of the trilogy!! KANG steals the show!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a fun movie. I enjoyed it very much 
Yes it has flaws but still very good
But still not every movie ment to be endgame.
It gives me enjoyment and story is decent."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Pls don't listen to critics this movie is actually awesome this will mind blow you guys and a good start for Marvel phase 5....
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid outing for antman, I still feel like the next phase could‚Äôve started with more of a bang, Kang was awesome tho "
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I found the movie entertaining.  It had fun, light-hearted elements. Humor and serious, very serious dark moments. The format was sort of cliche and cookie cut (material we've seen from other movies), but overall I enjoyed it.  Definitely the best Ant-Man movie of the franchise. Kang was great!  That needed to happen. Kang needed to be AWESOME AND HE WAS.  The end credit scenes laid the groundwork for the danger that's coming."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,ITS GOOD LAH! Wasn‚Äôt expecting much but it left me satisfied üòå
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Majors performance as 'Kang The Conqueror' is praise worthy, he delivers it with great intensity. Kang chaos is kicked off for the 'Multiverse Saga', with this entry movie of MCU Phase 5. Entertainment is filled with humorous comedy and action that MCU delivers as always. Adventure of quantum realm with good screen time is key to this movie, and you will love to see good family drama enhanced. Lower your expectation and enjoy this movie in 3D, I don't understand why is this movie getting such rotten reviews. Wait until last before getting of your seats, those two P.C.S . is awesome, it won't let you disappoint."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you liked the ""base line"" MCU movies, you will like this one. A lot of action, fun, some goofy scenes, pretty solid to great effects. The villain is imposing and a great character to watch. 

Overall enjoyed the movie, way better and more (tonal and generally) consistent than Thor Love & Thunder or Dr. Strange MoM."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie hands down is a great way to kickoff phase 5. It starts off as your typical ant man movie with Paul Rudds puns but shifts over to learning more about the new Nexus being of the MCU. Every actor was on point and vital to the story (except bill Murray). Solid movie definitely a must watch, definitely will be watching it again and over and over again on disney +"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very funny, with enough action and drama to hold the plot (Jonathan Majors)"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very much enjoyed the movie and didn‚Äôt get all the criticism it got from critics. It was very expansive in exploring the quantum realm, we got great action, some comedy, and a grade A villain for many years to come. Some parts were slight cheesy which I‚Äôm sure adds to the hate, but surely will watch it again and definitely stay for the 2 after credit scenes!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"the movie is good, but it has scenes that didn't need to be in the movie, like some dialogues during battles. That's the only reason it doesn't have more stars"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Predictable, poor dialogue."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's enough to satisfy me
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went into the film with no expectations. My teenage daughter and I are both Marvel fans and we loved it. It was a great father/daughter adventure film and the comedy was fun, the visual were awesome, and the extra ""aliens"" and other elements were soooo creative! It was was wacky, it was wild and it is worth watching again. I only wish I saw it in IMAX 3D."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing special effects and good story.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"after so long it felt like a MCU movie, not like M-She-U. movie gives old good marvel vibe, storyline is pretty decent not so great and not bad, this movie is worth cinema experience."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's wonderful start for phase 5 there are many thing to talk but go and watch movie you will be amazed this is why I love marvel becoz there movies are not just movies they are festival and forgot to talk about antognist Kant played by Jonathan majors just killed. I don't want to spoil it so give it try and don't miss both post credit sean 
Pintu xoxo"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed It and wish I could have more of it. So Grab some snacks and sit back and enjoy the movie!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great! The best movie after the infinity saga.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Definitely the best of the Ant-Man trilogy and doesn't deserve the low critic reviews. Paul Rudd ALWAYS delivers and Jonathan Majors absolutely kills as Kang and leaves me eager for his future! However, I felt the writing lacked in certain areas and could've been more developed (i.e. I could care less about the people Cassie saved cause we barely knew them and had no reason TO care). Finally, did anyone else notice how obvious the VFX was right when they entered the Quantum realm vs. how incredible it was at the end? The difference was palpable. Overall, I had a great time as usual and would definitely see it again but starting to notice more and more choppy VFXüëÄ"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,BEST MOVIE EVERRRRRR! You GOTTA SEEE IT!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"My least favorite spy kids movie, at least the 3rd one was more entertaining also i didn‚Äôt know white people had so much plot armor"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is absolutely entertaining and enjoyable. After all it is an ANTMAN movie. The set pieces were great and Kang just steals the show. The 2 post credit scenes will surely hype you up for upcoming projects.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing story! Great action! Ready for the future of MCU
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I felt really disappointed after watching the film. Modok was totally a joke in the movie. Story is not interesting enough and the fight scene is just so-so.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The plot itself was developed decently. Humor was 7/10 which is to expect from an ant man movie, however I felt a lack of suspense. More or less the movie teases us to what is to come. I needed more and it‚Äôs as simple as that."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great way to start off phase 5. Modok got done dirty but I loved the GCI and Jonathan Majors as Kang played his role fantastically.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"So, it's a good Marvel movie. I'll watch it again in theaters. But, it didn't give me any emotional, tear jerking kind of moments. Don't get me wrong, good movie, just not a Spiderman No Way Home cry fest."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved this movie and felt it was a great way to kickstart phase 5 and basically the Multiverse Saga. The Kang Dynasty is going to be spectacular if this film is any indication. Can't wait to see the next episode of the MCU.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a good adventure with a bit of a different aspect. Like Ant-man 2 it brought together the whole ant family to fight kang. It was a good story and answered many questions that we didn't know before. Johnathan Majors is an amazing actor who played this villain incredibly.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Divertido, eletrizante e uma boa abertura para o de fato vil√£o kang, n√£o √© t√£o diferente do que acostumamos nos 2 primeiros filmes, muito bom!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyable and I liked how they set up the next phase of movies
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The special effects were great!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Felt kind of goofy. Hated the quantum real take and environment. Kang beat by a bunch of ants? Too easy. Post credit was weird felt too ‚Äúacty‚Äù and the council was nonsensical.  Was hype when I first heard about and about Kang but left very disappointed
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved every second of it. Kang is absolutely thrilling. Best üêú man movie for sure. Very good start for the new phase.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lack of characters and story plot development. Terrible experience.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great over arching story! So many new characters, expected more with the villains but propels the MCU to the next phase"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely great! Must experience in 4DX format
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't know where all this hate is coming from. But I enjoyed it a lot. Yeah, not a perfect movie definitely but it is enjoyable and the 2nd half is just LIT. Don't get me started on the credit scenes... Those were freaking good."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang es magn√≠fico, es un villano amenazante, brillante , quiero saber m√°s de √©l y su dinast√≠a, antman tan gracioso como siempre y uno de los personajes mas optimistas del
Ucm, Cassie Lang me sorprendi√≥ mucho, espero verla en los j√≥venes vengadores .Una pel√≠cula muy divertida con momentos serios , un poco diferente a lo habitual de marvel y por eso me encanto, excelente pel√≠cula."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing and Outstanding.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!  Marvel back in the swing of things!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was funny, our theater was laughing throughout the film. You get attached to a few characters but that's every movie in my opinion. I think for an ant man movie this was great, definitely worth a watch for anyone who is looking for some laughs and great CGI. It's a small bite size of what's to come and very excited to see more of the new MCU phase for now."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Molto divertente come film forse il finale un po' meh anche qualche effetto grafico per il resto mi sono divertito
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was amazing. Visuals, choreography, language, just great. This movie is for the fans who realize this is the start of phase 5 and we are in for a wild ride with Kangs variants."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Expectations low but ultimately was entertained and Kang even provided some thoughts to mull over. The visuals, in terms of backdrop scenery, where impressive. And there are some fun characters in the mix. The best Antman film and the best the MCU has cranked out in a while."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I love to watch this movie 
And guys this is the actual only start of multiverse 
dark+comedy+action+vfx 
in one word OMG 
i recomend to watch 
dont judge by its score 
just watch it guys"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly a strong disappointment, I wanted more the the start of phase 5. Kang should feel like a threat, but doesn't. Jonathan majors and Paul Rudd are the only things keep this movie together. Jonathan majors has the ability to show the strength of Kang, but the writing is what brings this movie down. Great visuals, but nothing really happens. You could literally skip this movie and be fine watching the others, which shouldn't be the case with the opener to Kang."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania sees the Antman series reach maturity. Maintaining the typically playful humour associated with the franchise while giving a fun and visually astonishing ride. Though not exactly 'original' it delivers enough to be given a fair go. Plus, Majors. As Kang the Conqueror, he is exquisite. Think 'He Who Remains' meets Agent Smith."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't care about the criticism, a Marvel fan will love it"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really great start of phase 5.
Jonathan Majors really stole the show, and really makes me look forward to his future appearance in coming phase 5 movies.

What negative i can say is that some of the jokes didn't really land, and might have been a bit wrongly timed. but overall that didn't really take me that much out of the experience."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,it is a film that entertains sent funny and serious moments.the quantum world is very interesting.it lasts more than 2 hours but entertains so much that it felt like only 1 hour had passed.I enjoyed seeing Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really loved it
It was goofy at times and the battles were great and the post credit scenes bruh!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is not an incredible movie. But worth to spend time to watch. Everything was ok, not bad. The scene was filled with beauty."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While there are some plot holes throughout the telling of this Ant-man and Wasp outing and the graphics department dropped the ball in certain regards, I do believe it‚Äôs critical reviewers‚Äô score is uncalled for. Personally found this film, as purposed during the making of this production, really sets off what is to expected for the future of the MCU & actually gives the audience that sense of direction unlike the previous MCU outings we‚Äôve been presented these last few years which even during the after credit scenes felt like the after credits scenes of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, rather set-up for silliness & random cameos than an anticipation for the next outing. Maybe not the best film to start your MCU journey but if you‚Äôre a long time fan you can definitely the it‚Äôs a adequate Segway toward the next big confrontation. "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a ton of fun. You can poke holes in it if you're someone who likes doing that, but if you just enjoy enjoying the MCU, you'll have a great time."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great as I expected. Couldn't have been better. Everyone did a amazing.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you saw the trailer and Loki, you don‚Äôt need to see this movie. Nothing happens. Just watch the end credits"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was good, I love when a movie had a message and the action doesnt overshadow it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was just fantastic truly! People need to stop hating for the sake of hating kang was just phenomenal!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was the least interesting out of the 3 Ant Man films. The only thing spectacular about the film was Jonathan Majors' Kang the Conqueror character. He completely nailed it. Makes me want to become a villain! üò©
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Entretenida. Cumple con lo que se espera de una pel√≠cula de Marvel. No llega a ser epica pero igual fue buen inicio de fase y presentaci√≥n del gran villano que le toma la posta a Thanos  despu√©s de Endgame
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Had a lot of fun watching this movie. The humor absolutely worked for me. Can‚Äôt wait to see it again!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"CGI pretty good, Storyline fine, This movie can deliver who kang is. A little disappointed with Kang's end but still understanable. Overall, this movie still worth to watch"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wasn‚Äôt End Game level, but definitely better than the initial reviews. Formulaic as a lot of the Marvel movies have become, but Jonathon Majors is amazing and Paul Rudd is charming as ever"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang conquered and Scott grew a little. Dragged a bit and then good content to dragged some more. Give it some time. Looking forward to the next level 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I‚Äôve always loved and defended the Ant Man movies and Quantumania was no different. It‚Äôs the MCU multiversal event movie of 2023 and it‚Äôs a certified banger! 4/5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best film in a while from Marvel 8.8/10
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I had a blast. I was entertained, I like the actors and Jonathan Majors was great. Which makes me even more excited for Creed 3üòÑ. Fun time, switch brain off and if you are a comic books lover like I am, just don't analize it in that basis and you will enjoy even more!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sorry but this did not hit the mark. The acting was fine for the most part, Kang could become a threat IF he is developed better before the next Avengers movie, and the post credits scenes were awesome! However, the CGI looked VERY unfinished, the plot was meh, and the writing was probably some of the worst in the MCU. Not a good start for Phase 5. Wait until this comes out eventually on Disney Plus if you have to see it. Otherwise, let‚Äôs hope Guardians V3 is good because I‚Äôm REALLY getting concerned about the MCU. Score and Final Grade: 4/10 or D+"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I just watch the movie and this is awesome
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A good marvel movie, but not at all suspenseful"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kind of a mundane story line but so many INCREDIBLE special effects (even if a little heavy on reincarnating Starwars) that it's mesmerizing. Great Bill Murray guest character and Michael Douglas rocks. 

Worth seeing.¬† (See it in 3D) but no classic."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed from the jump! Johnathan Majors is incredible! Shoutout to the VFX Team!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Besides KANG!!!! Fun popcorn movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It‚Äôs really good movie and beginning of phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie plot made sense tied up loose ends every well
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,KANG!!! this movie is pretty good! Some jokes don't hit like intended but overall I really enjoyed this film!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it a lot. I don't understand how you could call this the worst MCU movie after Thor love and thunder though....
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst movie I've seen in years
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The trailer was better. Jonathan Majors and Michele Pfeiffer made the movie interesting. Without them it's another "" Honey I Shrunk The Kids"" movie. Looking forward to Kang's evolution."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Excessive jokes, poor storyline and few script flaws. Some scenes is super cliche."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie Rocked! Especially love that they decided to make it an experience with the 3D!  Rotten tomato score is definitely wrong for this- listen to the people- they are talking and they are saying this was a phenomenal way to start Phase 5 of the Marvel legacy!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not Marvel's best, but certainly not it's worst. Jonathan Majors' potential as the new big bad is prevalent. Look forward to what is coming up with Loki S2."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a very good movie with 1 of my favorite superheroes. Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors did a great job! A very good start for phase 5 in the mcu.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I have given marvel enought Chances . This was the last one
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a little weird at the end but enjoyable
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid! Fun movie and a great way to set up the future. Excited to see where it goes from here!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall great movie, the ending maybe could‚Äôve been a bit better.. felt like It was missing something but left a nice cliff hanger. Kang stole the show, AntMan and His daughter was amazing.. Great back story, it gets right to the action after a 10 min build up, you should definitely go see it.. Post credits was WOW! Esp. For Loki fans"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely Kang Steals the Show . The visuals are great although with some miss maybe beacuse use of volume especially the modok one . Actors performed nicely and post credits are also lit . The multiverse begins
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a bit underwhelming but that just because I was really hyped for it. It's definitely worth watching at least 27 times.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Goal was to introduce Kang, which it did. Other then that, no real novelties that made it any better than an average Marvel film. Really was hyped for this one and felt like besides Jonathan Majors, it wasn't good."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun to watch superhero film!
Not the best film of mcu it has flaws like (inconsistent VFX, 1st half I kinda slow ig)
But Jonathan's Kang is the best part of this film. Overall a good movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's good and entertaining. First 40 minutes wasn't upto the mark but after the entry of Jonathan Majors, the movie got really entertaining."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Someone please check on Kevin or the director cause they have been lacking lately. I expected more. This is actually the first movie I‚Äôm disappointed with. But it was nice seeing Kang and other things.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was most like Spy Kids from Disney and the series Lost in Space. But to each their own opinion.Best to say I will only see this once.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is a good movie. Love the growing as a family aspect of it. Needed a bit more action on both the villain and hero part of it, but good movie all around."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a really funny movie and I overall really liked it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I honestly don't understand what the problems most of the critics are talking about - I could follow the story - it seemed cohesive to me - the undeveloped side characters were interesting but didn't NEED to be developed (would love to see more them in the future though) ... this movie wasn't top tier but it was really good ... FAR FAR better than the last one ;-)
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it Jonathan majors is amazing as kang and the quantam world is visually stunning
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"These critics must be smoking something, y'all! And it isn't the good good. üôÉüôÉ"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in with an open mind after hearing all of the mixed reviews and ended up REALLY enjoying this movie- the CGI is gorgeous and this is by far one of the most visually dazzling movies I've seen in a while. Kang is really scary at times, and Janet really stands out in this movie- make sure to stay for the mid- and post-credit scenes!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was overall great and I'm fairly convinced a lot of people are going out of their way to hate-review it for no valid reason. Not even gonna deny it had its flaws and that some parts of the plot could've been developed better, but the story ultimately delivered and that's what matters. Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors stole the scene every time they were on screen and I've no complaints about that, it was phenomenal to get to see the original Wasp in action. Kudos also to Rudd and Newton, kinda wish we could've seen more of their father-daughter bond but was satisfied with what we got, same goes for the Rudd/Lilly dynamics."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Who doesn't love a good movie especially when there is Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas and don't forget the ants..."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good movie overall with minor disappointments along the way.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just watched this movie and gotta say it's one of the best marvel movie between 2020 and 2023. People please stop comparing this movie with love and thunder, this is way better than it. For a movie with 2hour run time they have done a pretty decent job. Jonathan majors have done a great job and Paul rudd did really good with all the actions and acting. Another thing is the post and end credit scene it's was way cooler than expected.
Please stop degrading this movie. Rotten tomatoes critics got a very shitty taste, y'all stop learning to these ass hates. Just look at people's score."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Kang was great, humor mostly landed. CGI very questionable at times, especially the first battle with the Quantum-people. I could barely tell what was going on lol. MODOK was hilarious and they definitely leaned into it. Overall it's not the worst MCU movie, but it's certainly not among the better ones. 3/5 stars."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what movie the critics saw, but Quantumania was everything I've ever wanted in a comic book movie. Absolutely fantastic."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ein sehr guter Auftakt f√ºr Phase 5.
Kang absolut Fantastisch.
Viele Star Wars und Rick and Morty Vibes.
Paul Rudd wieder absolute Spitze.
Neben Kang mein Highlight tats√§chlich M.O.D.O.K.
Abspannszenen sind Mega und machen Lust auf mehr."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"For me, more enjoyable than Love & Thunder (To much Taika humor) and Wakanda Forever (almost whole movie for 3 minutes of Black Panther?)

I had heard bad CGI on MODAK, but didn't seem that bad to me, MODAK has just been a sort of dumb look to begin with.

Enjoyed the movie and enjoyed all three Ant-Mans."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,The critics are being too harsh.. I enjoyed it. People say they want it more comic accurate and it‚Äôs not that far off. Decent movie 
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring Plot and Kathryn Newton Acting so Awful üëé
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,No one in the theater clapped at the ending of the premiere. I had low expectations and it was worse. There was lots of contradictions. No character growth and the story was awkward. Lots of plot holes and unmotivated dialog.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is way better than the second one, the critics are insane"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Cassie Lang bad af. fr fr fr
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Is a fun fast pace movie. If you know nothing about the MCU you might be a little lost watching this movie.... but let's be honest if you are going into the third film in a trilogy without knowing what happened in the previous films or other MCU movies, you shouldn't be watching this movie. Jonathan Majors performance as Kang the Conqueror was incredible. Majors was able to make Kang feel truly terrifying in a brilliant way. Kang is a true villain that feels like he was pulled straight from the comic books with very few changes made to the character. Unlike the massive changes that were made to Thanos (understandably) in order to bring him to the big screen for the noncomic book enthusiast.¬†¬†Bill Murray was a bit of fun but nothing more than a cameo. Cory Stoll as M.O.D.O.K. was fantastic, he was both disturbing and hilarious. M.O.D.O.K. is a difficult character to translate to the silver screen, but they did an excellent job translating this character.¬†I am truly excited to see where phase 5 will take us."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst MCU films to date. Majors is great as Kang. Otherwise the rest of this movie is a bore. Was literally dozing off in parts. Way too much sound stage cgi. Editing was terrible. And What the F was MODOK. Yikes.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Kang was a very cool villain. The rest of the movie was painfully long, dull, and a mess to look at. I wouldn't recommend seeing this in theaters."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie. I liked the comedic aspects of the film, but it also gave me a sense of panic and dread when stuff started to go down in the third act. Great character development for Kang, great setup for future projects. I thoroughly enjoyed the film.

I took off half a star because MODOK is one of my favorite Marvel villians, and I feel they did him a bit dirty and needed to look more grotesque."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily in my top 3 Marvel movies. I love how built out the world was. There's enough back story to get you invested in the characters without slowing down the action. Loved seeing Cassie come into her own and seeing the whole family working together for the first time. I hope they keep playing with the quantum realm. It's a killer addition to the MCU.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. Don't understand all the hate. The ending felt a little too easy to me but other than that I enjoyed it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman and The Wasp 
        Quantamania 

If you love marvel movies this one stands up to the top tier. I walked in thinking I was going to dislike this movie and was shocked when it completely changed my mind. Michelle Phiffer was the MVP, we really need a CatWoman movie with her reprising her role. Ant-man and The Wasp, Quantumania blew Thor love and thunder out of the water tenfold.. 
This movie has a great story, the cast delivers with so many funny and family moments. The VFX and action scenes were on point. I actually want another Ant-man movie.."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great start to Phase 5! Really liked it. 
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,They put way too much hype on this movie and it didn't deliver like it should have there was zero emotion it was entertaining but it wasn't worthy of five stars
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania brings a more serious Ant-Man to the table. The film is still filled with that same humor, just a little less of it and the stakes are way higher than any regular heist movie that Ant-Man has had before. Great to see Marvel taking their smallest hero seriously. And Jonathan Majors was absolutely amazing as Kang the Conqueror. His performance was mindblowing. Let's not forget Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne who steals the show during this movie. An overal great movie that got me on the edge of my seat and made Mr laugh very hard. Go see it!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"An entertaining movie worth watching, don't ask for more than a movie just for entertainment like this."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its was a good movie. The right amount of humor with seriousness. It wasnt a cheesy type of humor either. I think they could have explained certain aspects a little better, but I think it was great! Im also not a picky movie person either so idk how helpful my review would be."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It tried a lot of big things, and it probably suffered the consequences of having to build an entire coming phase for Marvel. But there was plenty to enjoy. There were fantastic pieces to the movie that got watered down by the bigness of the movie. Marvel is still trying to perfect it‚Äôs approach into the multiverse"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Worth to Watch, Marvel is finally rebuilding it's reputation."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I honestly loved this movie! There were times where it felt rushed but it didnt matter to me! Also just want to say never ever go see a movie based off movie critics!! This has a low score and I think that‚Äôs harsh.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly i do not understand the low score.

This movie like most of the MCU lately is full with so much creativity.

I have been watching movies since the end of the 80 s and i always find at lest a few stuff i have never seen before in the recent mcu movies.

This movie was also suprisingly very funny and the bad guy acting is amazing!!!

to be fare when the bad guy is in full cosutme he does not look tht good maybe it needs to be changed abit.

But all in all this movie totaly justify his price of entry i was not board 1 second and most importantly enjoyed it from minute 1 till the end

Yes it is not perfect some minor and important plot point are abit DEUS EX MACINAESS  but compare to the huge pile of positive it does not ruined the film at all.

To conclude i am actualy happy of the bad reviews before i see the film , cuz this way i go in with no expectation and leave the Cinema very happy just like all the fase 4 movies exept Etrenals ;-)

another high entry in the MCU!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was phenomenal. I got goosebumps so many time. Loved that we got so much Janet, so much Kang. Loved the Scott/Cassie dynamic. The story respected the previous installments and kept the Ant-Man feel but took risks and they paid off. They set up future drama perfectly. I think the critics were so off-base with the bad ratings."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn't ended as I thought it will. But still one of the best movie after endgame.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is one of the worst super hero movies, very strange and predecible, Marvel movies are just more of the same."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I felt it was a good spring board going forward with the MCU. Finally a more serious tone for Rudd to flex more than just his comedy muscles.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"bad : Kang abilities one dimensional and defeated by ants, bad cgi modok and Cassie. Good: the whole antman family strengths utilized, mostly good cgi and another good antman movie to add to the antman trilogy."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm honestly mad at the critics who gave Quantumania such a low score and made me think this movie might stink. It doesn't. Weird? Yes. If that's not your vibe, I get it. But it is excellent. Jonathan Majors is him. Paul Rudd is great. Michelle Pfeiffer too. The story fits. The dialogue works. Feels more like Star Wars than a Marvel movie. It helps set up Phases 5 & 6. Don't worry about the critics score at all. Please do yourself a favor and watch it!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw it yesterday, really loved it, only thing that bothered me a little was the depiction of M.O.D.O.K., but that didn't ruin anything."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Majors is fantastic in it. If this film lost one character (Modok), it would be so much better. The visuals were always going to be odd for Modok but the MCU version is terrible and results in one of the cringiest lines ever in the MCU. If you take out that entire arc, the film would be much better"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was one of the better of the new marvel movies and it was really funny!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The title should have been Kang The Conquerer in Quantumania. What a terrific performance by Jonathan Majors. Kang Dynasty begins....
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun time the whole time. Felt like a Star Wars movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pros - 1.sets kang as a truly ruthless and one of the best MCU villans . 
2. Jonathan Major's acting üî•
3. Gets u exited for further phase 5 &6 .
4. Some really cool moments.
5. enjoyable MCU movie I was waiting for since phase 4 . except (nwh )
Cons- 1. Inconsistent VFX.
2. M.O.D.O.K. was wasted .
3. Screenplay in the 1st hr 
4. Kinda predictable plot , trailer gave away almost everything.
5 . Not a standalone movie , feels like an 1 st episode leading to the Kang Dynasty.

Overall a god movie. Don't trust critics , it's a movie made for fans to enjoy not for critics to judge , so make ur own opinion."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun watch. Jonathan Majors and Michelle pfeiffer were standouts. Excited for Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"critics what say what this movie was not justified because this movie deliver us the entrainment, action, little comedy, Serious in the mcu film that we need and this film deliver. This movie setup the kang story and how it will connect to kang dynasty."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was an average film which basically sets up future movies and tv shows.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly amazing movie and Kang was üî•
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie does not deserve the critics RT score it was given‚Ä¶ pretty good, Kang is menacing and threatening"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Very Good Movie for my opinion.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was good not great but it‚Äôs not bad. Jonathan majors really did a great job with his character. I love how they portrait kang, like he is serious this villain doesn‚Äôt make jokes. He got no emotions for no one. Really loved it. CGI was  inconsistent of this movie,"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Had an absolute blast watching this! Darren and Kang were incredible. Can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs next 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't know what the critics are complaining about, this movie is actually really well done. 
The story-telling is really solid and the comedy was not over the top. People need to rate this movie properly because it's way better than these critics are saying.
Kang is something else. Majors and Pfieffer killed it but the whole cast did a great job.

4 out of 5 stars easily."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not a great start for the MCU.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,My favorite marvel movie since end game
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania is a thrilling adventure. The movie is a Major step up from recent(I'm looking at you THOR), and shows promise for the coming movies. CGI could use some work, but in a movie that's 95% CGI, I'll cut marvel some slack. The quantum realm was gorgeous"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,People are hating on it but it was a good movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's quite fun ride for a marvel movie not what the critics are saying and man CBM fans gonna love post credit scenes
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing and funny all the way through definitely watching it again
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Of all the phase 4 Marvel movies, this one is the best one.  Jokes are a bit of hit or miss, but solid movie altogether."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible movie, it's not even a comedy at all."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Only saw this for Kang- he was amazing. Everything else fell short in my opinion.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the critics! It's a great movie and an exciting glimpse into the future through Phase 5 (and 6)
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a marvel fan this movie was awesome. Yep, not everything is perfect but still it touches my heart. Honestly by seeing Scott's seriousness I was afraid if Scott also get an ending like Stark. But thanks to the Director. 
However it was such a great moment to be able to watch Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania.
Thanks everyone ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite the critics, this is a really good movie. Definitely see it in theaters."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics are either crazy or high. This movie is awesome. Highly entertaining and visually pleasing. Really don't get why it's getting so much hate -___-
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel in it's recent movies has made the mistake of rearanging the continuity of their characters power. For some scenes the heros or villians are overpowered, and in the next they are weak, and without explination this takes away from the story. Jonathon Majors gave an incredible performance in this movie but plot armor, strange out of character choices, and an unclear explination or consistancy on how strong certain characters are have ruined this movie, and many other marvel projects after endgame. A story should stick to the rules or promises that it sets, and if it decides to change them then it needs to be adress in some way shape or form. I really hope that marvel can someday get back the good story telling that it lost."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, favorite of the 3. I loved the world building, my faves were Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors!!üòçüòç"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Predictable, poor dialogue. Definitely a Disney + movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a fun film. I loved the family dynamic and it great to see Hope and Scott together again.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the introduction of Khang and of course that they had Modok that was a nice surprise and clever with who they used and the story they went with. Overall amazing movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great adventure, funny, and action packed! Don‚Äôt know what the critics were watching?"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Es la primera vez que me duermo en una pel√≠cula de Marvel, la trama es lenta y no hay desarrollo de personajes, creo que las escenas post cr√©ditos la saga del multiverso hubiera comenzado de igual forma."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a great way to begin phase 5 of the MCU. I can‚Äôt wait for more content now!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall, Quantumania was a lot of fun.  Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors(among others) were fantastic.  As ludicrous as the concept of the movie was, it felt real and there weren't any major plot holes that come to mind.

The overall message of the movie is one, which my son, and any other kid would greatly benefit from - 'you can make big mistakes, and that's ok, and that no matter what, your parents will be there for you, love you, and do anything for you'. The unfortunate part is that there is about 1 minute at the end of the final battle, which is far too brutal for children to whiteness, so when I watch with my son, I will be skipping those moments. 

The only other ding I might give this movie was on the look of MODOK, who, for several reasons(many of which are integral to the character) just didn't look right at all.  

Overall, Quantumania rounds out the Ant Man trilogy as a clear best character saga from the entire MCU hands down."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good fun movie but should probably see Loki at least if not an experienced comic reader
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The Conqueror stole the show! loved the plot and light humor.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyable, Kang really ""CONQUERS"" the film in every scene! I Love the Antman movies and I think this was a satisfying addition and excited to see this next phase of Marvel!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,star wars knockoff storyline
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Simplesmente fant√°stico, √© o melhor filme da marvel desde homem aranha 3. Sem frescura nenhuma sem inventar moda, √© um filme muito bem feito em todos os sentidos e ainda usando a f√≥rmula marvel, ja tava na hora."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang is coming and Ant-Man and the Wasp:Quantumania proves that in spades! Jonathan Majors brings a full-on menacing presence as the MCU‚Äôs newest big bad and he proves that he is/will be a force to be reckoned with.Paul Rudd is as fun,funny,and emotional as Scott Lang/Ant-Man,as is Kathryn Newton debuting as Cassie Lang.Evangeline Lilly,Michelle Pfeiffer,and Michael Douglas also kill as the Pyms (Hope,Janet,and Hank respectively).And don‚Äôt even get (me) started on M.O.D.O.K.! üòÇ The music/visuals were truly amazing,especially since (I) saw the film in stunning IMAX 2-D,and did not look half-bad and sounded amazing. And the story was pretty well-done as well. Go see it! The future of the MCU is going to be a ride indeed! Can‚Äôt wait!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are out of touch. As Comic book movies go, this is a SOLID entry. Certainly better than Wakanda and waaaaay better than Love&Thunder. Johnathan Majors is a STUD! Very compelling villain and steals the show and I can't wait to see what else he brings to the overall story. The humor is pretty good. 7.5/10"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love the Ant Man movies and this one does not disappoint. It had great action, humor and storytelling for the future phase. Can't wait to see the movie again!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved that movie!!! I expected a bad movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. I loved the way Scott still has his past explored in this film. Kang is fantastic and has shown some of what he can do. The negative reviews are being unfair. It's full of comedy, action and... STAR WARS??!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best entry of the Ant-Man trilogy and a phenomenal introduction for Kang! Majors, Pfeiffee, and Rudd give great performances and the quantum realm is visually incredible. Gets off it's feet quickly, which I was pleasantly surprised about, wasting no time getting to the conflict. Also those 2 post credit scenes were enough alone to make it worth my money!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie blew my mind at every turn. The beginning of the movie was a bit rushed to me, going into the meat of the story so quick. Some of the CGI was off in some sections but not noticeable like Thor: L&T.  I loved the movie as I watched it with taking it for what it was. Other reviewers stated it was badly written and not funny but it was better than they stated."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie is ridiculous and weird. Now it depends on whether you like that. Loved Hank Pym and Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is proof that critics don't understand what makes a great comic book super hero movie. It is one of the best movies Marvel has put out and it introduces us to one of the biggest villains they have. It fits very well with the last two movies and gives us a great family movie. Go watch it, don't listen to the critics. If you like Marvel Comics, you will like this movie. However if you are just an MCU fan, this might feel a bit different because they don't hold your hand during the plot. Things just progress and happen, which is refreshing. 
Again just go watch it!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant Man and The Wasp was a good movie, because it introduced kang and other kang variants, and also it is a family movie. In overall it was fun to watch."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good movie loved it
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It exceeded my expectations. Thank god critics have bad taste in movies. The movie is nothing short of fun and heartfelt for everyone in your family to enjoy. And it really made me excited for the future of Kang in the MCU.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good story. Sometimes has wonky dialogue. A lot of convenient plot devices in the film. A lot of things that screen writers just skipped that definitely needed to be explained. Bill Murray cameo is wasted. Still fun. Not as funny as the first 2. Definitely could have gone without the social Justice warrior storyline. Not necessary and wasted screen time. Overall, good not great."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"First of all, I would like to say that I really liked the film (as a Marvel fan). However, my criticism will be directed at the ""pseudo-critics"". 

1. Rotten Tomato critics seem to condemn much of Marvel out of hand. Marvel is the big bad that ""ruined the movie experience"" - possibly they'd rather go for dramas in real life situations, with a heavy fate looming that must be overcome. That's perfectly fine for them, but many of us are attracted to other things.... namely by epic Marvel movies that make us dream! 

2. here I go on 2 explicitly selected ""criticisms"": - 

Quote ""The film tries to be substantial"". Here the author tries to take a Copy Past Template and I bet this is in 90 percent of his reviews, because it says everything and nothing, main thing is to sound very dramatic and make it seem eloquent. - 

Quote ""You don't know what I've experienced, (Kang) yes what have you experienced?"" This critic seems to have never bothered with the structure of Marvel movies. Because here stories are not worked off in one movie. Besides, a Kang, has 100000000 of stories and backgrounds. That's what makes him very unpredictable. I want to point out here that these critics have no idea about Marvel. They just see a movie from Marvel with a lot of CGI, without even understanding the big picture. They don't understand the innuendos in the film, the characters, or the magic that so impresses us fans. 

Now I'm going to get a little emotional and unobjective at the end. I would therefore like to apologize in advance. 

There is nothing special about you! You have no special skills that need to be learned, nor is your opinion important or carries weight! Let's enjoy movies and stop writing everything down negatively just because it doesn't meet YOUR criteria, so that every sensationalist paper can jump on it and play with people's hatred. 

We love Marvel and their movies - there's something for everyone. No matter if you are a househusband, a sportsman, a nerd, a mother, a teenager, a child, no matter which country you come from or which religion you belong to."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie Jonathan majors is amazing. This version of Kang is good üëç but there are other versions coming stronger and smarter. Sets up future mcu.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,MODOK stole the show for me 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Introducing the new villain of mcu. You can see the threat of Kang in the movie. Also it is fun to watch. Much better than phrase 4.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Idk why the critics were saying it was bad??? This movie was awesome and one of the best ant-man movies. Loved Paul Rudd as always‚Ä¶ def watch again! KANG WAS DOPE
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I watched the movie it was okay a lot like black adam, with too much hype, and a big Marvel letdown. I think it went too fast and couldn't cover everything just like Dr. Strange's MOM. The movie was okay in comedy (although it didn't need it) and disliked how they wasted two terrific characters. Especially how they killed M.O.D.O.K., it was pretty stupid how somehow Kang was so dangerous but was almost defeated by Scott and crushed by Ants. I also really disliked Cassie, she was annoying throughout the movie. The post-Credits were pretty good, the first was okay because it was dum how the Council of Kangs were scared of Ant-Man since he defeated the Kang in Quantum-verse and saw him as a threat and his Universe (lazy plot). The second was better since it was teasing Season 2 of Loki which is something I'm hoping to watch. Overall it was like 6/10. Just bad plot"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I felt like this movie stayed true to antmans comedy while also making me fear the big bad, even more than Thanos...Jonathan majors was the perfect actor for this role!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is awesome and getting us ready for what is coming and I know it is something big
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was amazing , effects visual and sound were crazy. Marvel never disappoints"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It wasn't a wild marvel experience it was an ant man movie it had perfect amount of humor good plot great villain Kang really went all out on this one it's enjoyable it's fun 10/10
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was badass modok scene was emotional kinda quantam realm scenes were gorgeous overall 8.5/10
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"more Kang, very happy :)))))) everyone else was good too"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,lmao movie was garbagio. poorly written and the jokes didn‚Äôt get off. boooooo tomato tomato tomato im throwing tomatoes.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Besides Jonathan Major as Kang there is almost nothing good about this movie. Super forgettable not a lot of action and pretty bad performances from almost all parties involved. 3/10
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fans of Marvel movies will enjoy this one. Great action sequences too!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Weird that this movie is getting all the hate. It‚Äôs an Ant-Man movie! Thought it was good. King is awesome!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Idk what movie the critics saw but I really enjoyed this film. Biased  maybe alil but honestly it was another FUN ride at the movies!! so look forward to what comes next. If you've been on the MCU ride this one doesn't disappoint. we couldn't stop talking about it all the way home..üëçüèºüëçüèº
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Trust me this movie is damn good! Don't listen to these SO CALLED critics!! Those losers doesn't know sh*t. I loved the movie. 4/5.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Antman 3 definitely takes the cake for being the weirdest MCU film, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Paul Ruud and everyone else was as good as always. Kang was definitely one of the better MCU villains. The story and visuals are good as well. However the MCU needs to just stop forcing in comedy. The more serious the story, the more engaging it will be. A joke here or there is fine, but the movie cant seen to go 10 minutes without a joke. It's not as bad as Thor 4 levels of misplaced humor, but still. Only a couple of jokes actually made me laugh, the rest could be cut. Overall it's a good MCU film. Not the best but certainly not the worst. It sits right there in the middle of my MCU ranking."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good movie, great story, great plot, lots of action... Not a single dull moment. 

I saw the critics giving it a low score and I thought it was going to blow but it was really entertaining.

Great beginning to this new phase."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is easily the best marvel has done since Endgame. Fantastic.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was hoping for a bigger ending, to give a real direction of where were going to go in phase 5, I really enjoyed the movie. my favorite of the Antman series, Overall, my expectation Kang, the conqueror were not met, I did not want to see him get defeated by the Ant Family, I dont think he is Dead, and hopes he goes on the be the Beyonder, I did love seeing the council of kangs, but want to see this version kind of win and make it out, or maybe he was Victor timely, or transferred his conscience, one of the other kangs, somehow this Kang has to come back"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just as fun as the other Ant-Man Movies. Bright, colorful, and lots of action."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Aside from the plot holes that comes with time travel and multiverses, this movie does have a good amount of sci-fi value. It's Scott Lang doing his best to keep things together. Ignore the anti-Disney rants on this one as it's not in the same line as some of the prior content."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Impressive Marvel Movie kinda like star wars
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great . I thought it was the best in the ant man series . As always don't listen to the actual critics . They babble on just to get a comment in
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Felt like a great movie experience. Definitely a better sequel than the 2nd movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,plot was predictable and same marvel plot in every movie. only watched because I had amc a list and nothing else out that is good.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not enough action johnathon majors outacted everyone Paul Rudd tried to hard to keep up with himpacing issues in third act. Bad ending too many questions left unanswered undeveloped characters one too many jokes. The stakes seemed missing or lackluster at times
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie , really enjoyed the characters and their interactions , cgi was a little off but kangs performance carried the cast along with Paul rudds"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Terrific addition to the Multiverse! The world is so serious, these movies are just what we need to have a little fun and use our imaginations!
Kang is awesome. Fun storyline and the flow was great. 
Keep em coming!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Was the best marvel movie I have seen in a while
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"5/10. While entertaining, Ant Man and The Wasp: Quantumania was highly skippable, which is unfortunate to say considering this is our first big look at the Conquerer. Even though it was great to see Kang on screen, this movie kinda hurts his image moving forward. Ant Man has come a long way, but this story didn't really feel true to his character. The movie was basically just a sequence of highly convenient events that in the end, will impact the greater story maybe 1%. Normally in a Marvel film this isn't a big issue, but with Quantumania...it seemed like the whole purpose of this film was to push the greater overarching narrative forward."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good!!! Great special effects and kang killed it!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors rock the show. If you are a comic book fan you must love this film. It brought all what an artist was thinking to the big screen. Love every second.  A comic book film come to life
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I think the last trailer gave away the ending a little too much. My guess for the negative reviews is Michael Pe√±a isn't in this movie with his awesome story telling.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the critics got it wrong on this one.  This movie was great!  Entertaining from beginning to end, and a great start of Phase 5 of the MCU.  So much you know is coming that stems from this movie, and I can't wait!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It is not good when one's favorite part of a film is the mid-credit scene. üòê
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had some issues with the editing, but my goodness it was a funny movie. And they made Kang a very credible threat, excited to see more Kangs in the future."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"horrible CGI but did like some of the plot, cliche finishing"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Top 10 MCU Movies For Me. Kang Is Terrifying, Can't wait for Kang dynasty."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is great, nothing to combine"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I straight up loved it. I had high hopes for this movie, before the reviews came out and dashed my hopes a bit. But I had a blast from start to finish. This was definitely a lot more over-the-top, and comic-booky than most MCU movies, but that is what made it great to me. I expected this level of weirdness and Comic drama from Multiverse of Madness. Really so pleasantly surprised. I've seen lots of praise for Kang, but that is really selling Scott, Cassie, M.O.D.O.K, Janet, and Hank short. They all got to have great moments. Hope could have used a bit more screen time, but what she did have still worked."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Decent start to the next big arc. I feel like the low scores are coming in because it a big Sci Fi Flick, nothing like the other two Ant Man Movies.... and the general population just doesn't like Sci Fi. Must watch though if you're planning on riding through this second major Marvel Arc."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme altamente dispens√°vel, cgi exagerado, estragaram o M.O.D.O.K, amo a marvel mas estou extremamente decepcionado com os √∫ltimos trabalhos. Precisamos de uma hist√≥ria enxuta e que d√™ vontade de torcer para o futuro daquilo."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid, fun, visually dope.  Kang was excellent.  Don't believe the critics on this one.  A thorough and engaging ride."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Decent. Not as good as the first or second films where they were more creative with the shrinking and growing powers better. Janet conveniently avoiding explaining things after they get sucked into the quantum realm and also getting a vision of who Kang really is were too glaring contrivances I couldn't suspend disbelief for. Great acting by all as always though.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,My son and I loved it! I love that Cassie was super involved and of course I love Paul Rudd! Great movie in my personal opinion
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This discount-Star Wars circus lacks any kind of narrative cohesion, loses all the charm of the original two movies, and sets up a chaotic and unintelligible end for this phase or saga.  It was bafflingly bad in every way, sparsely funny, almost always clownish, just a relentless stream of strange choices, stilted dialogue, and missed opportunities.  I hear so much praise for Majors' Kang and all I see is scenery-chewing antics but I'm not seeing any depth to this character.  He's an aggressive, evil narcissist like any low tier villain.  The true tale to astonish is that this director has somehow been hired to helm the next Avengers movie. Quantumania is an epic travesty."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid 5 stars. Yes yes yes! Thrilling start to phase 5. Love Scott, Cassie and their family.  Majors was excellent and the movie was so funny!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't get the hate for this. Beautiful visuals, fun fight scenes, an intimidating villain, an interesting new world with fun side characters. I'm a sucker for the Ant-Man style of fighting changing between small, regular, and giant, and this movie did it the best its ever been done. It's as good as any Marvel movie can get without going into mind-blowing territory. So no mind-blowing stuff, but fun comic book fights and villain plots is still pretty good. Plus it sets us up for what I believe will be an interesting multiverse arc.
I'm convinced the bad reviews are hooked on the Infinity Saga and comparing all mcu movies to that era. This isn't that, and that's okay. It's okay to like a comic book movie because it has likeable characters, formidable villains, and exciting fight scenes. It doesn't need to be more than that to be good and worth watching."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great! Best of marvel in a while. A couple of dialog and annoying characters at times but I‚Äôm expecting Kang will be 1000x better villain than Thanos! Excited for the future
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Desde el punto de vista estricto no logra ser coherente con la narrativa de un s√∫per villano.. se queda a medias y eso la hace ser una m√°s
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great, had a very good time watching it, I don't know why people are hating on it. Probably biased."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was worried after reading the critics reviews, but I actually really enjoyed it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It is the best Ant-Man movie. It is fun and I love the family dynamic of the movie. Kang is a great villain. My only complaint would be that there should be more Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not great. Very childish.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie. MCU needs to wake up. They are bleeding fans.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film! I‚Äôve seen all the MCU films opening night. AMATWQ was great! Predictable at certain points, but entertaining. Great set up for the future of the MCU. Can‚Äôt see where they go next."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a great movie! Jonathan Majors and Kathryn Newton are fantastic and welcome additions to the MCU both playing their roles to perfection! Will definitely be seeing again!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not really a Paul Rudd fan but he and Jonathan Majors carried this movie, also was this Ant Man And The Wasp: Quantumania!? Or was it Cassie Lang: Hanging Out In The Quantum Relm? Why did Kathryn Newton get so much screen time? She was average at best."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great performance from everyone, Janet Van Dyne was great. One of my favorite actors of all time Michael Douglas aka Hank Pym came through in the clutch with his clan! Scott Lang showed people his dedication to protect his daughter at all cost. Last but not least, Kang The Conqueror has arrived!!! Magnificent acting from Johnathon Majors for the showing of Kang‚Äôs mighty hand on the multiverse. 4.5 out of 5 stars for me."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang was for real!! The Quantum world was amazing. The story was average, a little campy at times, and as expected, unfortunately."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Donot make your opinion by seeing the critics reviews it's a very good movie individually and also sets up the future storyline. The narration and the vfx was a bit off and a few characters had not been used properly but it's all fixed by kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is probably the best Ant-Man movie. For once it doesn't feel like a filler between or after big team up movies. Sure it is a set up movie, it sets up both The Kang Dynasty and Loki S2 but it does it well. The Quantum Realm looks fantastic, Jonathan Majors as Kang steals the show anytime he's on screen. If you like the MCU so far, you're gonna like this one."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not the best MCU movie, or even the best Ant-Man movie, but still a fun time. Slow first act, but the final act was such a fun time. The movie acts as more of a set-up to kickstart the next phase of the MCU rather than the ending of the Ant-Man trilogy that we deserve. I thought the jokes were great and I didn't feel like there were too many or placed at the wrong times, like many MCU movies. Kang is a serious threat, and you feel that. He doesn't crack a joke once. Was hoping for more, but it wasn't a bad time, just feels a little formulaic. If you're a fan of the MCU, you'll have a good time, but don't go in expecting this ""large scale"" ending to the Ant-Man trilogy."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Entertaining but the pacing is off and it hurts the film. The film doesn't flesh out the characters enough and a basic MCU film where you can see the marvel formula. This is only recommend to turn off your brain and enjoy it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are clout chasers. This movie is funny and impactful for phase 5.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Thor started out serious and got comedic. Any-man started out comedic and got more and more respectable.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The is the least I have enjoyed a Marvel Studios feature film. I have seen every MCU film and the majority of the Disney+ television programming. The cast is nice and ready to bring their A-game. But unfortunately it looks and feels like you are just watching actors stand together in an empty room in front of a massive green screen just speaking the same lines to each other again and again. I should have gotten a Bingo card out (or maybe even played a drinking game) to keep track of the amount of times a character shouted the other's name in faux-desperation. ""Dad!"" ""Mom!"" ""Henry!"" ""Hank!"" ""Hope!"" ""Cassie!"" This might be the most stale Marvel dialogue to date."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,My girlfriend and I enjoyed this movie. I can see why some people don‚Äôt like it. Although I think they are being extra critical. I think it it‚Äôll people to important I‚Äôm the long run.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, I appreciated the world building this movie did. Background characters were able to thrive in an organic way that made them more interesting. The film had great themes paralleled between different sets of characters and did justice to every main player. The balance of humor was appropriate. I had low expectations and loved it. 

Wish MODOK had been kept around but only because I really enjoyed the portrayal of the character."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics, this movie is a lot of fun. Good mix of Sci-fi and action, also Johnathan Majors as Kang was fantastic. Can't wait to see more of him going forward. Definitely recommend it"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The director came out saying he wanted this movie to feel Endgame level, and boy he did. For those who complain it doesn't feel like the same humorous predecessors, that's a lame take. You want movies and characters to grow and adapt and to be honest there were still several scenes that had the theater cracking up. This movie has gotten me re-excited about the future of the MCM(ultiverse). Great performances all around. Best comparison I have heard is Ant Man x Endgame x Star Wars. If Kang were the Emperor and MODOK were (a funny) Darth Vader plus the cool scenes and overall feel of the Quantum Realm, that comparison checks out. Go see this movie and stop hating on Marvel because of Thor Love & Thunder."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang was amazing but the plot sucked
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,An important MCU movie must-see.If you're an MCU fan a nice time in the theaters
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,That was worth the wait
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great visuals and Kang is awesome. MODOK was completely wasted though. I also don‚Äôt really get how Kang claims to have killed all the avengers and then gets beat by an Ant army. Really fun movie either way.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"While Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania may not fully carry on the campy tone of the previous installments, it's an overall solid start to Phase 5. It finally feels like there is an active threat arising in the MCU and Kang will be a great villian for years to come."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantumania was great! Really got into the story. Loved it from beginning all the way to the very end. Perfect introduction to the Kang Dynasty.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors killed it as Kang!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed it. Was it a perfect movie? No. Was it as bad as the critics made it out to be? Not even close. I think this is a movie you have to see & judge for yourself.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,it was goooddd very colorful
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang and his potential for the MCU was the best part of the movie. Everything else about it was subpar. Good story but not great. I still want to see quality acting and storylines as we build towards what‚Äôs next. Still worth the ticket but here‚Äôs to hoping Marvel does better with GoTG3
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me gusto, estuvo muy buena, para mi la 2da mejor de ant man solamente detras de la 1era"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A solidly entertaining film. (FAR FAR better than the so-called critics would have you believe). Majors shows why he's a perfect choice for Kang with the promise of far more cunning and ruthless ones to come. Action is reasonably well paced and considering how goofy he could have appeared, even MODOK comes across well.

A few things could have been done better. But overall, this is an enjoyable, sit back, grab some popcorn and just enjoy the show. Not something where you can analyze every small detail other than look for visual ""easter eggs"""
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film. Funny and the action was just amazing!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant Man and The Wasp Quantumainia is the first movie of Marvel Phase 5 and continues the multiverse saga storyline.
First and foremost, let me say with certainty that critics over exaggerated the flaws in this film. I see where the criticisms are coming from, but I don't see what the problem was with this film. . They said that this movie didn't have any values made no sense because it clearly had value, but they weren't as large as we believed.
One of the primary issues is the writing; with the exception of Kang and Janet, the writing style felt quite off at times and could've been lot better. Kang's dialogue was crucial in moving the film ahead!
I never had the impression that this was an Avengers-level film because, in my opinion, it wasn't. It was a straightforward narrative that wasted no time in establishing it's own scene and people.
The characters were adequate, I liked Kang and Scott and Janet and Cassie, but Hank felt wasted and like he was simply there - he didn't bring anything to the story and felt like a side character; the same can be said about Bill Murray's part- we didn't need him there. Bringing back Darren Cross as MODOK was a wonderful idea, and I thoroughly loved him in the picture, but I was disappointed that he was taken off so fast; I hated that MODOK was a one-and-done character, but it was to be anticipated.
Absolutely, this film was a set up for 'Avengers: Kang Dynasty' and Loki season 2, but it merely outlines what's to come. At first, I was upset that Kang was murdered off, but then I realized that this was only a variant and that the real Kang was still out there somewhere. Don't be upset since kang got taken down.
Overall, this movie wasn't as bad as many people said it was. Many people exaggerated this movie as if it was as bad as Love and Thunder... it wasn't. This was extremely action packed with the same humor that we're used to seeing with Ant Man, and I loved it from beginning to end. I understand the complaints, but I didn't hate it as much as everyone else; it's a solid movie that foreshadows what's¬†to¬†come¬†next."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to critics, go see it yourself. There's plenty to enjoy!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,very cinematic and fun
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man 3 & The Wasp 2: Quantumania! Truly enjoyed this & just wanna see more Ant-Man, The Wasp, along w/ new young Avenger Cassie as well as Janet & Henry! "
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good entrataining super Hero movie. Fast, fun and full of action! It's not the perfect movie but it's worth watching"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,More of the same marvel blah.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a very nice journey to the quantumrealm. Had a few laughs, because sometimes is the movie so hilarious. And I was not bored because I was on the tip of my chair. So if you are a Marvel fan from the beginning, you're gonna like this one. It's strange to say, but I like this movie the most of all the three Ant-Man movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I came in with low expectations and man this movie actually did it for I really enjoyed it!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,I wish it was more action
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked how they insinuated Kangs humanity. From this inception point, Im going to assume that Kang lost his wife & family through a direct result of one of his variants. This is the reasoning behind why he goes on a murder spree & eventually gets exiled from the council of Kang. Hopefully, he grows in strength because having human Scott Lang & the wasp beat him, seemed lackluster"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The best installment in the Ant Man Franchise and a great kick off to Phase V!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,pretty good more of a story but it was not bad
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was fun! Started a little slow, but ended well, I think. Definitely a more chaotic vibe, with some visual silliness, some that worked, some less so. A few underwritten characters, some good surprises, some beautiful (if at times overwhelming) CGI. I'm still not sold on Kang but willing to be swayed in the future. All in all, I was entertained! :)"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critic's reviews aren't worth a damn, this movie plays out like the purest form of a comic book, completely over the top, extravagant and vibrant. The score has the signature Marvel thematic hybridity with orchestral scoring to create the character's true sound. This movie is an experience, and true comic book fans will love it. Sure, there are a few growing pains, some of the dialogue feels unnatural in places but is generally funny and wholesome. Cassie has a clear strong future in the MCU, and this movie has elevated Ant Man from the cute, side-character stories of San Francisco right into true multiversal Avenger territory. What a way to launch into Phase 5. True comic book fans will, and clearly do (judging by the more accurate 84% audience rating as of now) love."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good fun and great CGI world of quantum realm
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a fun movie, fight scenes were cool and all and the villain and plot as a whole was really interesting and fun. But my mine gripe, and a lot of marvel movies fall this way, is that everything that happened in the film to continue the plot sequence was way too convenient and made absolutely no sense at times. It was still fun because I went with a group of friends but even then I was a bit disappointed that it was another cookie cutter marvel movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quite fun! I understand the complaints, and had some of my own, but that didn't make me not enjoy it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great start to Phase 5! Interesting twist on Kang's origin. Not sure why the ""critics"" are hating on this movie. Perhaps they don't get the comic references? Me and everyone I know that's seen it have loved it!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was by far the best MCU movie I've seen since Endgame. Kang wrecks!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it!!! I can't wait to see what is coming next
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"TLDR: If you like most Marvel movies, you're going to enjoy this one. 

This was SO MUCH FUN. From start to finish, it's action-and-story-packed blast that is chaotic, fantastical, and does everything a Marvel movie normally does.  It's sentimental, crazy scifi/fantasy and makes you feel like you've been in the Quantum Realm for two hours and witnessed some insane stuff. The humor level was just the right amount for an Ant-Man movie, most of the time. My only gripe is that it all takes place over a short period of time (ha! Ironic) but that's not stopping me from putting this in my top 10 favorite #MCU movies. Thank you, Marvel, for giving us a *major* escape from reality!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film very enjoyable don't listen to critics.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Marvel playing it too soft with letting the heroes lose. Majors played Kang perfectly, a composed and disciplined man holding back a monster. So calm he was terrifying."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know what the critics were smoking. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Fun and adventurous. Maybe not Oscar-worthy but highly entertaining. I enjoyed it more than Wakanda Forever.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"this movie is SO GOOD, best marvel movie since spider man no way home, wow marvel thanks for this art"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Solid introduction to Phase 5 and Kang into the MCU. Jonathan Majors stole the show, he was the best part of the movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie had a very cool concept, but it felt like a filler episode in a tv-show."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang is a stand out but the rest is so bad. This was not the franchise to fully introduce him on film. Kang deserved better.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,I thought ant man 3 was a pretty decent movie and I had fun watching it. I loved kang and i'm very excited to see more of him in the future. It wasn't a perfect movie but I don't see why they're being so hard on it.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang was weak!!! all that hype and the man can't kill anyone no one of weight died.  all that hype for nothing.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,What a great start to phase 5. The critics are way wrong on this one. Jonathan Majors has me stoked for the future of the MCU.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jonathan Majors is too good for this
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don‚Äôt listen to critic reviews, this movie was amazing. Definitely a step up compared to Thor L&T and Multiverse of Madness. Kang & MODOK were both awesome and the stakes were high. CGI was great. I had absolutely no issues with this movie and I‚Äôd honestly rate it 3rd on my list of favorite post-covid Marvel movies. 1st Spider-Man NWH 2nd Shang-Chi"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Ton of fun. Really cool comic booky stuff
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a Start of Real Marvel Movies üî•‚ù§
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Two thumbs up...movie rocked
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fun. If you have not seem the d+ show Loki you may be confused.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome. It had alot of action and comedy. It's a great start to phase 5. Don't listen to the critics. Dont listen to the critics is all I have to say.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's a  complete cinematic joke. Childish script with primitive visuals. Marvel will be bankrupt if they actually go with there next phase with such content
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great special effects and visuals.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Saw it tonight, and was really expecting to be a lot better than it was. While I do think it was better than pt2, it was nowhere near as good as pt1. 

Kang was by far the best thing about the movie. Jonothan Majors really conveys the characters emotions and passion on the screen. Really excited to see where they will go with him. 

Other than Kang and Scott, I didn't feel invested into any of the other characters. The new Cassie was always smirking when things were serious or deadly, like she knows it's all a joke and she doesn't need to take any seriously, even when it endangers people. 

I'd say it's worth a watch for the world building and to see the next Big Bad. But don't go in expecting a blockbuster like some other Marvel movies. It is however, tons better than Dark World and Love and Thunder."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,They gave Kang the Michael Myers Ends treatment. He is supposed to be almighty and an avengers killer but they made him look weak. I was okay with the slow plot but man was I upset with how Kang was defeated so easily.. Make it make sense.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie. Kang is gonna rock the MCU for years to come!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are out of touch with the point of the MCU. The film was well paced, smart, touching and celebratory. Jonathan Majors is FANTASTIC and I can't wait to see what he does with the role as Kang. This is a fantastic start to an exciting new era of Marvel."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I loved KANG, Jonathan's performance for me is what stood out the most in the film,
Quantum realm was amazing,
Quantum people were a little bit cringe at times,
Couldn't connect much with Cassie,
Hoped for a better ending but it wasn't so bad,
Amazing CGI and Visual Effects,
Good start for phase 5, can't wait to see more of KANG"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good visuals and love marvel but writing was a bit off
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!!! Best AntMan movie. Great way to kick off phase 5!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was fun to watch. Id see it again. 

Modoks face cgi was so bad!
The writing for Cassie was corny. 

Marvel may run into trouble making an Avenger level threat look weak against ant man."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was worried this movie wouldn't have the same fun energy that past Antman movies have had, but it was so fun the whole way through while still having a big impact on the MCU. Scott and Hope stepped up to an even bigger level as heroes. I thought it was a great addition to the Antman lineup and the MCU. I'm stunned to see others scores so low, because I loved it! Excellent work."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Ant-Man film of the trilogy, Paul Rudd, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Jonathan Majors really shine in the film. Typical Marvel movie, just a fun watch and plan on seeing it again."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best thing , engaging, enjoyable, fun and *Kang* is the best so this is must watch"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not sure why it has bad reviews. It's really good.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great! Really sets up the future while still having an entertaining story
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I wanted to like Quantumania. It was okay ‚Äî much more enjoyable than Thor: L&T. I think the movie tried a little too hard to convince the audience that Kang was a menacing, mysterious and fearful person and forgot to focus on making it a bit less clunky. The pacing was a little off and the movie didn‚Äôt really sell me on the relationships built with the new quantum realm characters. They were all just there for comedic relief and I just didn‚Äôt buy the idea that Cassie grew fond of any of them. Also, Janet just displayed that tired trope of ‚ÄúI know something extremely important but I‚Äôm not going to tell you what it is and just be frustratingly vague about it all‚Äù. "
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Majors played a great Kang. The plot was good but some of the characters were unnecessary
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"LOVED IT! I randomly remembered I was supposed to be bored, checked the time and it was 50 minutes in. I'll actually see it again in theaters unlike Love and Thunder where I almost walked out."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this movie is fun. But telling the story It made me feel confused and didn't quite understand some parts. And the joke came at quite the wrong time. Additional characters do not have to be brought. But let's face it, Kang the conqueror is very aggressive and brutal. But there are quite a few aggressive fight scenes. I wish there were more fight scenes, but the character M.O.D.O.K doesn't like the role very much. Overall Ant man and the wasp Quantumania was fun but not bad."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a really  good movie do not believe the rotten tomato critics ,,,,their rating sucks man !!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"phenomenal performance by all. Loved the new big bad. The movie had me guessing (wrong) the whole time! Don't buy into the critics reviews claiming ""lack of spunk of earlier adventures"". This isn't a happy go lucky plot. The characters face significant danger and loss the entire movie from an enemy more powerful than Thanos. Forgive them if they aren't as spunky as previous movies. The interjected humor is not over the top and serves well. I love the high stakes ahead that Marvel just outlined with this film, and the two credits scenes are must see!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was amazing and the recliners are comfortable
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Was better than Thor and Dr Strange but the vfx were lacking
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great introduction to Kang!  The Kang Dynasty is finally here!  Kathryn Newton plays Cassie wonderfully.  MODOK was fun to see, however, I do wish it was a different version of him.  Overall, this movie was fun, exciting, and makes me hyped for the future of the MCU!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors stole the show. It had its Marvel comedy here and there but took
Itself much more serious than some of the previous Marvel movies that I didn't enjoy. This was my favorite Ant-Man yet. Can't wait to see more of Kang!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was truly a thrilling experience and an amazing and exciting start to phase 5. Jonathan Majors' performance was phenomenal in the movie, and it really does set up the tone for the rest of the multiverse saga. This movie is the best of the trilogy. It still manages to keep the humor and focus on the serious stuff happening. 10/10 must watch."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A bit too cheesy at times, but all in the appropriate tone.  It's a fun popcorn flick that knows what we're there for and doesn't get distracted trying to flesh out things better left questioned.  Mid-tier MCU, but still something fun and a good setup for the coming Kang conflict."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought it seemed to advance some of Scott and his primary supporting cast's pre-existing plot threads, while also doing a good job of setting up what's to come for the broader MCU.  It's enjoyable as both an Ant-Man movie, and as an MCU movie that sets up the new couple of phases."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Well below the marvel standard. Acting/delivery was at its worst. 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant Man is not the hero to carry the entire MCU on his back. When you manage your expectations, this movie is not winter soldier but another ant man adventure with a star wars feel. Kang is incredible. There were a few meh jokes but I think they were intentionally supposed to be meh because that's who scott is. Overall I enjoyed it. This was a fun + much bigger adventure than what I expected from an Ant Man movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall, I felt this movie was enjoyable to watch! From cool action sequences and the weirdly placed jokes, it all cooks well together for a classic marvel comic film. Jonathan Majors totally steals this movie in my opinion. I couldn't imagine this movie being as good without him."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,My favorite of the antman trilogy!! My friend group and I loved it a bunch!! Solid MCU entry and I'm so exited to see the future of Johnathan Majors Kang!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. Marvel did it again !
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pym Particles. This is a movie, where Pym Particles are the thing that saves EVERY situation. And I mean EVERY Freaking Situation! Pym Particles here, Pym Particles there, Pym Particles everywhere!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is where the fun begins
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is a great start to phase 5 and a fun ant-man movie. Marvel is finally starting to spin everything into a cohesive narrative again!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun romp into the Quantum realm with the likable cast. Janet and Kang are the standouts but everyone gets a moment to shine. Not the deepest movie, but good pace and lots of big implications for the MCU. Heart and spectacle. Avoids the jumbled plot mess of Eternals and isn't boring like Thor Dark World."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"NEVER listen to the critics!!! All I saw were negative reviews for this movie, and they couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth!! This is the BEST Ant man movie yet, and the first great marvel movie of this phase."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie lacked the fun which the earlier marvel movies like Endgame or movies before that have. However the new villain is good but in the ending he was a bum. First he was flicking ant people with his finger, making holes in the universe, etc. But in the end Ant man beats him in a fist fight with just little help."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely better than the last ant man movie. Almost didn‚Äôt see it because of the critic rating but gave it a chance. It honestly was as bad as they made it out to be. Kang was badass but could‚Äôve done more. Post credit scene was is useless 
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very boring, Kang only bright spot and it was still really hard to stay up through it all. Just go to YouTube and find a nice voiceover overview."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is absolutely crazy. Absolutely loved it. It really gets you thinking. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll say. ü§ê After watching it I ADORE Kathryn Newton‚Äôs Cassie Lang¬†SO much now. Aside from loving Jonathan Majors who absolutely tore it up as Kang¬†. JM is going to SERVE the next few years, there‚Äôs no doubt about that as the Conqueror. Paul Rudd and them made it so enjoyable. Loved the visuals off The Volume. 2 end credits (1 mid/1 end) really jump this Phase 5 in great fashion."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was a great antman movie, our antman has different priorities now but still has the humor. The humor doesn't go too far like love and thunder. There is a bit of shoe horning to get our characters where they need to be but it doesn't break my immersion. This was the perfect mix of funny and serious that just hasn't been there for the last couple of movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite the negative reviews, I went into this movie with an open mind, and I came out liking it. It wasn't the best movie ever, and this was based on some story problems, and the direction they took Hank and Hope. However, I liked the world building of the Quantum Realm, and the acting from some actors was great. I like Michelle Pfeiffer's performance, Paul Rudd was good, I really enjoyed the relationship between Scott and Cassy, but Jonathan Majors stole the show as Kang. He really got me excited for the future of the MCU, and I think that's what the movie did best. It set up kang as the next big bad, gave us two good post credit scenes that set up more, and started phase 5 off in the right direction, setting the MCU up (fingers crossed) for a bright future."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is incredible, just like Eternals, the critics hate it, and the audience(real fans), love it. Modi's is hilarious, and the journey the characters go on is so much fun!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome continuation from Antman and The Wasp! Stay until the very end.....
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great fun! Different from the last two but loved the action and family dynamics.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best marvel movie recently
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a really good progression for phase four. Honestly thought the plot was interesting and engaging for MCU fans. Might be confusing if you haven't watched the Marvel shows. 10/10 y'all should go see it
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure why the critics decided to hate it. It's an entertaining stepping stone, and provides more development/exposure for Cassie, which is good as I'm assuming she will eventually be a Young Avenger. I personally loved seeing Scott's love for and relationship with her as well, and appreciated the parts where that was showcased."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics get it wrong again. This isn't a stand alone movie bruhs.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are wrong about this one, is it a blast!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure why the critics gave this such a bad review. The story was complex, yet not hard to follow. Great acting, way better CGI, and sincere world building. Bravo, Marvel"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thoroughly enjoyed it. Having watched the Loki series I knew what was coming. Jonnathan Majors has arrived.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand all of the fuss. This movie was serious, fun, entertaining & kept me engaged the whole time. The best out of thr 3 Ant-man movies in my opinion and Johnathan Majors rocked as Kang!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie I have seen in a long time! Boring, pointless, cliched, corney, and just plain weird. I loved the previous Antman movies and this has ruined the MCU for me forever!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very poorly written. None of the characters really work toward anything, and success and failure in this story seem to be up to pure chance."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-man and the Wasp Quantumania lives up to its name sake. MCU Star Wars, MCU Dune, pays a great amount of sci fi/mystery movies that came before it. A more serious entry of the previous ant-man movies with higher stakes and the Most Menacing Villian in Kang.  Johnathan Majors and Michelle Pfeffer nearly steal this movie. The post credit scenes are good, but a huge set up of what's to come."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, Kang makes a great enemy.. you can't take him as 1 Kang, you have consider them all. They will rival Thanos. End credit scenes were really good as well."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Very entertaining had a great time watching. Jonathan Majors was amazing. Can't wait to see what he does in the next few movies.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very very very entertaining! Lol. Scott Lange was at his best role, and he delivered. Everyone in the cast did amazing. Very much worth the money spent. Finally an MCU movie I really enjoyed after the flops from 2022. Kane was super smooth, cool, and collected, until the very end of course. There was a number of very funny moments throughout the movie. I definitely recommend and take your kids to see the movie. Btw, there are two end-credit scenes at the end."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A movie that is a lot better than expected. Could have easily worked as a stand alone.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action, visuals and don't skip the post credit scenes."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally a return to the power and fun of earlier Marvel films. A fantastic jaunt through unfamiliar worlds, a good section of laughs and a confrontation with a truly terrifying villain. I loved every minute."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan majors dominates.  Kang is just brutal and relentless.  I don't know why the critic ratings are so poor.  This movie is a hell of a lot of fun. At the end of the day it's a story about family and lost time and keeping your word.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG! Whew, I didn't know what to expect but seeing a serious Scott Lang was actually great! I love how each Kang warns that the others are progressively worse and each time they're right. The first post credit scene has me more hyped than the Thanos reveal! must watch!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw rotten tomatoes and I was really scared that it would have moments where I would be like ""they're right‚Ä¶"" but it was a great movie! I enjoyed it so much! Marvel at least gave us a nice movie that I can watch with my family! Antman is still one of my favorite avengers and heroes and I can't wait to see him and his family go on more adventures. The only reason I gave it a 4.5 review is because it didn't show me what I was hoping for but I was very content with what they gave us. I also had lots of awww moments because I love the family they created."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Cassie is the reason it all happened. Thanks a lot Cassie. It was all your prideful self's fault.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid start to phase 5.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A good start to phase 5. it was highly entertaining and kept me engaged. it is the best out of the 3 ant man movies in my opinion.  I'll be going back for another viewing this weekend.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall, an otherworldly and captivating addition to the Marvel universe. Jonathan Majors does a great job bringing the ferocity of Kang to life, and Paul Rudd brings his A game as always. I think there were some missed opportunities to actually show us why Kang was so feared, but maybe they're saving that for future films. I think Michael Douglas's Hank Pym got pushed aside quite a bit, but I did love the flashbacks we got with Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet. In all, I hope the next time we see Kang(s), they really show us his an even worse size of his worthy of being an Avengers level threat. I still really enjoyed the film quite a bit despite it missing a couple marks."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the wasp: quantumania was definitely enjoyable was it the best of the marvel movies? No.. was it fun? Yes did it keep to the charm of the Ant-Man movies? Definitely... Would I recommend it? Yes I would... Sure some things didn't make sense if you hadn't seen the first 2.. but I can definitely say go out watch this movie have a good time :)
 Paul rudd absolutely is fantastic as Scott Lang. And Kathryn Newton as his daughter Cassie shined.. honestly made me want to see other performances she is in

Now where it fell flat.. I felt like the villain wasn't given too much backstory so that could have been better.. also some of the special effects weren't so great..

Overall though for what it is.. this is a marvel movie that sets up the stakes for future films... But get out take your kids enjoy it:) 

Don't take my word for it"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang was the best part of the movie badass villain !!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved every bit of this movie. All the negative reviews are obviously a bunch of trolls.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Except Kang everything was worse, bad CGI, bad Acting (specially by Newton), bad writing. Worse than Eternals. Hope Marvel pulls up in GOTG3"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,The red juice blob. I didnt like the rushed ending.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"De la trilog√≠a de Ant-Man mi favorita, tiene buena acci√≥n, comedia (como debe esperarse de Paul Rudd) y va al grano la trama, dejando en puerta lo que viene de KANG; El que critiquen algo sobre el Reino Cu√°ntico, por favor explique, c√≥mo es el reino cu√°ntico en realidad...

Buen inicio de la nueva Fase de Marvel Studios.

Por cierto, solo recordar que es una pel√≠cula de superh√©roes, no es drama que espera recibir 10 nominaciones al Oscar."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"We made it through MCU phase 4 and here comes  the start of phase 5 to hopefully shell out slightly better content. First up is Quantumania, which unfortunately was barely just ok. It's not completely terrible, but far from the best. I did enjoy it better than Thor: Love & Thunder and Eternals, but it's not making my top MCU movies. The film does look great though. They've borrowed heavily from Star Wars in the world and creatures/characters they've set up in the Quantum Realm. There are also some very good performances, especially from Jonathan Majors as Kang and Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne. In all honesty this film was surrounding their two characters Kang & Janet. I was surprised how much focus was on Janet's character considering this was an Ant-Man and the Wasp film. Janet seemed to have way more screen time than either of them. Especially the Wasp character. Wasp is barely in the film. This really isn't a bad thing though as Pfeiffer does so well with her performance and really steals the show out of all the Ant family. However, in all seriousness Quantumania was just MCU filler to literally set up Kang's character. 

Jonathan Majors as Kang is brilliant! He does very well with the material he's given. He's charismatic and ruthless as Kang and Major's pulls off that flawlessly. However, given he's supposed to be the next big bad his appearance in Quantumania just tipped the iceberg of what he's capable of doing. I'm torn that his first true appearance was against Ant-Man. Nothing against him, but in all honesty Kang is bigger than Ant-Man. No pun intended. Even after the credits roll it says KANG WILL RETURN. It usually says the character of the film you're watching. Aside from the visuals and select performances, Quantumania was pretty lackluster. Not a ton of action nor much excitement. There are two after credits scenes that both do get you hype for what's coming. Unfortunately, they're tacked onto a film that's mid. In the end I had just an ok time with this one. Check it out if you're a diehard MCU fan, but as has become standard lately just manage your expectations."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Antman is the best marvel movie post endgame. Antman is underated and always great. One of the best trilogy. I still cannot understand whats wrong with critics rating. I absolutely loved the moved. I am so hyped for kang now
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this movie for those of us that actually have read the comics this was a enjoyable romp in the Microverse.  Critics really don't get this movie and a lot of the source material behind the Microverse was way weirder than the movie portrayed, which was nice change of pace.  This movie is less humorous than the previous two movies because its dealing with a villain that is actually a bigger threat to all reality and multiple realities.  I was disappointed that there were no references to the Fantastic Four since they are strongly tied to this Villain.  To understand how devastating to the whole multiverse and all realities that Kang and all his variants pose cannot be understated and that its Ant-Man and Wasp that have to face him is the ultimate David and Goliath situation.  Kang is portrayed masterfully both as a threat and sympathetic.  This movie is with the watch, especially for Marvel fans."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant man defeating Kang, that is a good joke! movie is messy...."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Delightfully weird.  Marvel fans will enjoy.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I was in the edge of my seat the entire movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Came in expecting disliking based off critic's reviews but I honestly had a great time. There were some pacing issues that sometimes did feel like there was a lot happening but Jonathan Majors as Kang is amazing (really goes in and showing how scary Kang can be) and seeing Paul Rudd reprise his role as antman was great to see. Was a good movie about family and whats been happening since we last saw him. Great all around
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Worth seeing in my opinion. Definitely better than I was led to believe. It did all the things it needed to do for me. I can be quite critical of movies at times, but I had a fun time with this one.  I didn't care about the minor flaws. It's an AntMan movie, its about heart and family and finding a way to over come the odd as a more down to earth, non-typical hero.  I think people are starting to become too jaded and demanding of their comic book movies that they forget how these movies are meant to be enjoyed."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the better marvel movies in a while. The comedy was placed MUCH better than Thor, he emotional moments, lots of action, great fight sequences. Better than almost all of Phase 4."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Me gust√≥ esta pel√≠cula porque mostr√≥ el poder que tiene una sola variante de Kang. Me gust√≥ el reino cu√°ntico y Antman y The Wasp lucharon contra Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,it‚Äôs a simple introductory of Marvels new villain with plenty of laughs.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm happy I didn't listen to the critics, and this situation often reminds me that critics don't always know what audiences will enjoy. I had a great time and walked away happy as a relative newcomer to the marvel fandom(I hopped in with wandavision) The environments and creatures alone made me stay glued to the movie, and there were plenty of moments where the majority of the people in the theatre were laughing and seemed to be enjoying the film. I laughed more in this film than most marvel movies. Jonathan's portrayal of kang is superb, the acting in general holds up and seems natural as you can be in a CGI world. If you enjoy the movie going experience, I believe you'll like this film."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie was good but it still too kiddie. Marvel needs to make real movies like infinity wars I'm tired of seeing the good guys win all the time
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kick start of Phase 5!

Visual Effects is pretty smooth

Jonathan Majors's acting is so conquering 

Michelle Pfeiffer went such badass while she stole every scene is nuts 

The story maybe good, but few minutes later it was so banger

The Post credits will blast your head away"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A triumphant entry into a new phase of the MCU. It kept the lovable undertone of the previous Ant-Man movies we know and love, while keeping the stakes multiverse-level high. Jonathan Majors is the crown jewel of this piece, and his charismatic nature leaves you almost wanting him to win."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure if it's because I had low expectations due to the bad reviews, but I really had a good time with this movie. Not the BEST Marvel movie ever, but FAR from being the worse. M.O.D.O.K. was absolutely hilarious, the action was great, visual effects were great - lots of star wars vibes. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,i am not even the guy who can read others mind but i know everybody disappointed
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had the craziness of the multiverse phase 5, but with the classic Marvel feel and jokes you'd expect from Ant-Man.  There's a lot packed into this film, but it wastes no time to get the plot moving and isn't overwhelming 'all action'. I watched Loki to prepare for this movie and found it helpful to follow along."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A hole filled, exposition dump with more contrivances than a Saturday morning cartoon. What an insanely disappointing ending and waste of an amazing performance.  This movie was the final nail for me, marvel is now something I have 0 hype for."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was goood i wouldn't rate 5 but it was good , i enjoyed the cinema And in the end it all that matters , HANDS DOWN TO JONATHAN MAJORSüõêüõêüõêüõê"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"from the cheesy writing to awful vfx(modok) to killing off a big bad in just one movie - this movie should have been absolutely scrapped.

oh, the actress who played Cassie was so monotone-d in her expression and body language - while some scenes felt serious and somewhat scary, she reduced the actuality of it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing visuals, this movie is absolutely stunning! Ant-man never disappoints."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie very funny and kang was as intimidating as could be. Only 4.5 because I feel it should have been more serious and focus on closing the trilogy rather than opening more questions. Great cutscenes and can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs next in the MCU!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good fun movie with great special effects. Gave a little more about kang and also the quantum realm. The movie jumps right into the action. Funny parts and serious parts. Scott and the gang Duke it out with kang. Wasn't a 5 star movie but a sold4 There were a few iffy plot armor moments but I loved the movie overall. It did seem a bit star wars'y but that's fine Will buy and watch again. Excited to see what's next!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was excellent! Before we criticize something so harshly, we occasionally have a tendency to overlook the amount of work that actors and writers put into it. Kudos to everyone involved in this and creating something for us. I enjoyed how this movie made ties to past Qantum Realm references and crossovers with comic books since it took me to an other world. Amazing movie!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Look out for the little guy
What a movie.üî•üòç"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The action felt non-stop‚Ä¶and the special/visual effects were astounding‚Ä¶a well earned five stars
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Really liked it! Great action
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a very fun ride and looking forward to the future with Kang!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a fun movie, great start for fase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,IMPRESSIVE! Welcome to Phase 5.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"El peor inicio de una fase, pelicula que solo importan los 20 minutos finales, quien la defiende, cada vez se conforma con menos"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie!! Leaning into the Science Fiction genre really worked for me! It was creative and the visuals were striking!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was good. It felt like more of a Kang set up than an Ant-Man movie but it had really nice visuals and was fun enough.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you compare any movie in the mcu to the standard of infinity war and endgame you are going to be disappointed (that was the culmination of how many years) , which I read over and over again on reviews. I was pleasently surprised by this movie based on critcs. Well the movie is fast paced and the plot is limited in development it does work. This could have been two parts easily, but let's be real you aren't investing two movies back to back for antmam. This finally begins to weave together the other movies and TV shows of the mcu and you can finally see the glimmer of where feige is taking us."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good watch, the humor was mixed in well and not overboard like Thor Love and Thunder and Kang was great"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Very fun movie. Visually it was stunning. Very reminiscent of Star Wars for sure. Kang is Epic! Just sit back and enjoy the ride through the quantum realm.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Boy did the reviewers get this wrong!!!  Rotten Tomatoes is rotten tomatoes!!!  I thought it would be a confusing mish mash.  It was easy to follow.  The cast was amazing.  Suspenseful and satisfying.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't believe the critics this time, this is a fantastic entry into the MCU that takes the humor Paul Rudd is known for and brilliantly sets up the next phase of movies. A must watch for a marvel fan with a couple of fun end credit scenes."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It is still a very good movie. The hype is still there and all I can say is that this is worth watching!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was fantastic!! Shocked to see the critics hating on this movie after having seen it myself. Honestly, what qualifies someone to be a critic these days?!! They get it wrong far more than right it seems. Great marvel movie, great Antman movie, and an incredible introduction to Kang's more sinister side. Loved it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Really liked it one of the best MCU films in awhile
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics. What did you expect out of the quantum realm? I got exactly why I expected and more. It had the same humor and tone of the other Ant-Man movies, and I absolutely loved it. Jonathan Majors KILLS IT AS KANG! GIVE US MORE KANG!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was slow in certain parts but picked up and had plenty of action scenes. Had a good mixture of a comedy and serious storyline. Would definitely recommend better than the last couple of Marvel movies..... yes, including Black Panther 2"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is enjoying family friendly and I love Marvels movie 
and I getting more excited to the next installment, 
overall it is great must watch this."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Not understanding the hate... Very ambitious and creative. Has that Ant Man humor, but Kang is coming! Worth the watch."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I figured the rating was from people in suits trying to pick apart the movie. It definitely wasn't the best movie ever but it was the most fun I've had in a while!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had a lot of fun watching this film. Seeing all the members of the Ant Man family was awsome in this. And ohhhh wow, Modok? jeez, they did it. They actually made him work from the comics  and made the whole large head with tiny limbs make sense. Really enjoyed this film and yeah, gonna come back a few more times for more XD"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie definitely doesn't deserve the hate it's getting from the critics but I understand why. Fans of sci-fi, fans of the MCU and fans of the comics are absolutely going to fall in love with this film. It's so much fun I don't understand how you couldn't. Most critics don't fall into any of these categories. Go see it in IMAX while you can and judge it for yourself."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not a perfect movie and not a movie that I recommend for everyone but I think it's does its job I care about the characters as much as I wanted to but I actually surprised with how engaged I was with what was happening on screen I think the script is written pretty well the special effects were great Modoc I didn't hate him but it wasn't the best third act did get a little too chaotic for my taste but it wrapped it up in a bow and two post credit scene don't miss them
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Action packed
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, Johnathan Majors incredible actor."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie achieved nothing on its own and contributed very little to the MCU overall.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I expected more but a solid movie to just have fun watching  ps if  you looking for answers for the multi verse it‚Äôs not here but still a good movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Marvel Movie of the year if you know what I mean‚Ä¶ predictable but awesome.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel fans will enjoy. Only bill Murray could deliver the acronym for the ""hunter"" given how insane that character is.  Yes this is light-years away from the first two movies but moves the bigger narrative forward. half a star for no Luis."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,introduce the next level of Antman with major villan for the next several movies.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Quantumania makes sense of the multiverse's future and fixes the story's connectivity. Although the pacing is too fast, I think I like how it is explained and how horrifying it is. I adore the way they describe Janet and Kang's connection in Quantum Realm. They may have something in those thirty years, in my opinion. I also adore the movie's visuals. Though I think it's alright, Michelle and Michael overlapped the characters of Evangeline and Paul. The CGI for M.O.D.O.K. is good although I think it could be more hideous. And I believe I see why some viewers say it's a mid movie they still do not know what will happen in the future, but if you're a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you already know it will have a significant impact. I believe the filmmakers didn't keep the general public in mind when they were creating this film because they wanted to tell a bigger story that some viewers might not yet be able to grasp.

The only jokes I find offensive are ""Holes,"" ""Dick,"" and the names of the song themes they produce, such as ""Kang Bang"" and ""Fifty Shades of Kang""?

But that post-credits scenes are fire and I'm excited for Loki Season 2 and Avengers: Kang Dynasty"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't believe shitty movie critics, watch the movie yourself and see what it's like. I promise you won't regret it. Lots of family fun."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a solid movie. Best of the Ant Man series. Kang stole the show and every scene he was in
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If there's one word to describe this movie it's ""boring."" If there's two I'll say ""inconsequential.""

There's minimal characters arcs, the action doesn't have any stakes and it has maybe the most excessive use of CGI I've seen since Attack of the Clones.¬†

The best part of this movie is the design of the world, but nothing feels real. It doesn't seem like anyone cared about the creative side of this movie besides the artists."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Quantumania offers us a potential villain that could overstep Thanos, Paul Rudd being Paul Rudd and setup for the future of the MCU that has me and others excited. While all those things sound great, this movie suffers from a lot of problems. The VFX are not terrible per say, but MODOK has no right looking as bad as he did. The movie fails to land half of the jokes that fill this movie to the brim. Certain characters feel like paper cut outs while other charcaters that we know and love, dont feel like the same people as when we last saw them. The story moves at an appropriate pace but is full of messy and lazy plot points. At the end of the day, Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania has its perks, but those are much outweighed by its flaws."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie shows logical action sequences, jokes are reduced, serious story telling is good.  Reality has been brought out by using blood in fighting.  It's a great movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing visuals, tons of action, hilarious!;Great addition to the MCU! Kang is a BEAST!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang is great 
Kang vs Lang .. loved it 
The CGI was insane 
Modock seems fine 
Great acting by our loved actors"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed it very much. Much better than the last few Marvel installments. Worth a theater ticket for sure!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang's Jonathan Majors carried
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I do not feel good about future marvel projects after watching this movie‚Ä¶..
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie. Visuals were perfect. Sets up the future of the MCU. Any so called critic that didn‚Äôt like or anyone who doesn‚Äôt like it are just stupid.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty damn goodone of the better marvel series movies imo
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun and entertaining! Kang is awesome!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and entertaining
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just watch if you‚Äôre a huge marvel fan, Worth the wait forsure."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best of the series, top 10 all marvel movies. Exciting from start to end."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best ant man movie by a long shot and  a great intro to Kang. Very excited for phase 5 and the multiverse saga.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good start for the Kang Dinasty, it really helps as a foundation to understand what this character is going to become."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,7/10 ; Father/Daughter/Family element helps drive the plot and Kang is one scary villain with a big road ahead. Overall it was a fun ride with the Pros out weighing the Cons of the film.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked it! 3D was awesome, so visually stunning!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Overused comedic relief, forgettable story line, doesn‚Äôt address phase 4 problems, water down version of Kang. Very disappointed. The end credit scenes were the highlight of the movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors....that's it. Did his damn thang in this movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good plot and visuals.  Acting could of been beret but Any man's character is naturally cheesy so there's that. Jonathan Majors was great! They gave you just enough to leave you lining for Avengers: Kang Dynasty in 2025. All in all its a must see for marvel and Sci fi fans (kinda of reminded me of star wars).
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure what the critics are smoking, best Marvel movie in a bit,  in my honest opinion."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love it, especially as an MCU, Ant-man, and Kang movie. Ant-man's shrinking and enlarging abilities makes him really good at fighting here more than ever, plus with Paul Rudd's good performance for Scott Lang. Kang is genius and we know about him a lot from this movie but know nothing about him at the same time. Wasp, Janet, Hank Pym, Cassie, and the ants are surprisingly a good addition to the movie. I just dont like the last 15% part of the movie. It feelks like the revolution plot point lost its focus and brought back to end the film. I also don't really like the 'doubts' Scott has at the ending, because the movie doesn't built up to have a cliffhanger."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are wrong and have no business watching superhero movies, maybe they should just stick with watching and reviewing the Pianist 3 or something. This movie was fun, yeah it had its Star Wars moments but it still managed to bring you into a whole other realm and Kang is such an amazing villain you find yourself almost rooting for him."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a solid start to phase 5 doesn't feel rushed or dragged out , kang , scott,cassie steal the show in this film and also this film really does tease whats to come down the road"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Look, MODOK isn't great. And you will need to watch a hefty chunk of the MCU to understand what's going on. But honestly, this was a thrilling movie to watch. Predictable at times, but with an outstanding cast, this movie really shines."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was alright but I recommend it
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania was excellent. Don't believe the critics. It was weird and wonderful. Super Sci-Fi and hilarious to boot.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"My husband and I absolutely loved it. It was hilarious, exciting, and intense! All of the main cast killed it! It really felt like we were watching marvel's equivalent to a Star Wars movie and it was fun and visually stunning."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel is back on track .. this was the first marvel movie I‚Äôve seen since phase 3 that had ALL the elements contained within it, great acting, excellent plot, character development, everything that made infinity saga so great! Minor things that could be tweaked but nothing major like some other previous films .. it‚Äôs a must see .. Kang is üî•"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie,kang is unmatched and good story"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I expected this film to be the Ragnarok of the Ant-Man franchise, and you can tell that was their goal. They didn't quite get that far, but it's not nearly as mediocre as Love and Thunder. It's a solid film despite its flaws, most of which are due to the writing. Some characters make questionable decisions, there are more than a few deus ex machinas, and a handful of the humorous moments feel really out of place. Die-hard fans will be thrilled but casual MCU watchers may be less enthused. If you already knew what M.O.D.O.K. meant before seeing this movie then you'll probably love it. If not, it's absolutely still worth watching but measure your expectations. If you expect an A+ and get a B- you'll be disappointed, but if you expect a B- and get a B- then you'll have a great time."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,MARVEL better get back on track or they will be in deep trouble
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"#AntManAndTheWaspQuantumania¬†was AWESOME! Paul Rudd, Michelle Pfeiffer, and JONATHAN MAJORS üòÆ‚Äçüí® killed it.
#KANG¬† made you feel something terrifying was pending whenever he spoke (or flexedüí™üëä).

"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it! It was a fun, action packed and had great humor moments. "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really good opposed to what critics are saying. A fun entertaining experience. All around great job from all the actors. Really strong performances from Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer. I can't wait to see more Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,great and funny movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Other than the last Spider-Man, it is the best Marvel movie since End Game.  There is still some woke messaging, but it is much less overt.  

I also had to remind myself that the characters are based in San Francisco, so why wouldn't Cassie now basically be a member of Antifa and why wouldn't Hank think Socialism isn't all that bad.

All and all, it was fun but some of the typical Marvel dumb jokes wereva little eye rolling."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie will be my guilty pleasure. It‚Äôs so absurd and funny and unexpectedly sweet! The family moments are the best of Ant-Man stories and THAT POST CREDIT SCENE!!!!! Charming little movie!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I like it but it was overhyped, its not a must watch but wasnt a waste of my money. Modok was funny though"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Johnathon Majors and Kathryn Newton absolutely steal the show in their entry into the MCU. Both performances were catapulted by a storyline that'll have us wondering what comes next for ant-man and the avengers down the road. An A+ performance by the cast and a great story.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly everything felt fluid and well thought out, the new characters were great and the side characters were decent enough to move and progress the story forward. Paul Rudd is amazing in fact everyone in the Antman family was incredible. Kang definitely stole the show, and it was a solid fun adventure and it did not feel like it slowed down at all despite what many critics are saying. Visually it is weird but isn't that what the movies are about, to experience something that we don't see in day-to-day life. Definitely recommend seeing it, I am going to see it many more times!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing , exciting, funny and action packed. Kang (Johnathan Majors) is A+++. This movie offers everything and is a great set up for the next big phase!!!! Must see!!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action and just enough humor.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The rotten tomatoes rating does not do this movie justice. Please ignore that rating and go watch this movie, I love Marvel movies and I go watch them the first day they come out. This movie easily is one of the best Marvel movies to come out in a long time. It sets up this phase perfectly and I‚Äôm excited to see what‚Äôs to come. If Marvel sees this can I get a black knight tease at one point I feel like that has been forgotten lol. Thank you for making such a amazing film Marvel Studios. "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was AMAZING! Maybe a little editing issues but the CGI, the story, the fact that Ant-Man had a somewhat serious tone and pulled it off was great. Definitely watching it again."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved it. Fun, crazy, and sets up the future of the MCU. Such a great way to kick off Phase 5! #MarvelGetsIt"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena pel√≠cula, me divert√≠ demasiado. El dise√±o y personaje de kang fue maravilloso, por ah√≠ le falt√≥ m√°s acci√≥n de √©l y Modok. Pero le doy 9/10"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Never listen to the snobby critics this movie was absolutely amazing. Very intense movie the ending will give you the chills very suspenseful.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. An extremely generic, bad film and a bad start to phase 5, Quantumania has as its strong point the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang and the beginning is very boring and the end is ok."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was definitely the best of the Ant-man trilogy, and Johnathon Majors killed the role.  Will definitely see it again."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Esta pel√≠cula empieza de una manera incre√≠ble, present√°ndonos un giro fresco en los personajes, un reino cu√°ntico que se siente amenazante y visualmente llamativo, junto con un antagonista misterioso; sin embargo conforme avanza la historia esto se va diluyendo hasta convertirse en una cinta gen√©rica de superheroes. 

Si bien el reino cu√°ntico es un escenario que permite jugar con la creatividad, la cinta se detiene a reutilizar ideas de otras franquicias, lo cual ocasiona que este nuevo mundo se sienta como muchos otros que ya hemos visto.

Lo que rescata a esta cinta es la din√°mica que mantienen los personajes principales, pero fuera de ellos una gran parte del elenco se siente sobrada. En lo personal rescato las actuaciones de Michelle Pfeiffer y Jonathan Majors sin duda alguna lo mejor de la pel√≠cula.

Al final la cinta no funciona por si misma pero logra enganchar a la audiencia para descubrir como es que continua esta saga con la introducci√≥n de Kang como el antagonista principal."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of fun!!! Jonathan majors plays an incredible villain. Very much a Star Wars vibe to this. And M.O.D.O.K!!!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors was awesome and I'm super exciting about the direction of the MCU. #kangwatch
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Unnecessary film about introducing the new big bad
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. I don‚Äôt know what the critics are talking about. They must have seen a different movie. Lots of action and comedy.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"We are Team Ant Man. It was a fun movie with lots of laughs, good heart and action sequences. Jonathan Majors was excellent as Kang. Michelle Pfeiffer Kicked Butt and  Kathryn was a really good Cassie. Paul Rudd please be Ant man forever üôÇ
It's a fun movie just go see it !"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, and sets Kang up as the next Big Bad in the MCU. 7/10 would recommend."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good, entertaining, saw in 3D, lots of visuals.  Def setting up for future but I thought there was enough in this to satisfy, filling in some back story for when Janet was in realm."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed every minute of it, it was amazing, definitely worth the watch, I totally recommend that everyone go see it"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Yakkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,it felt like the love was gone. The movie was more basic family fun than it was Marvel Comics. Worth the wait for streaming.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great visuals and effects hollow core. Interesting but underdeveloped new characters, this film is decidedly ungrounded, which works against the thesis of the Ant-Man sub-franchise. I guess it succeeded in bringing Kang to the big screen, but at the sacrifice of the Ant-Man cast of characters."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The so-called professional movie reviews that spoke down on this movie are not to be trusted. The quantum realm is easily Marvel's most interesting setting. Jonathan Majors was amazing as a completely different Kang from He Who Remains. He shows vulnerability and moves to being a menacing villain. The only negative I agree with the professionals with is that it lacked the usual Ant Man humor. It told a serious story about a place we've only heard of before and introduces us to the first chapter of the Kang Dynasty. I'm thoroughly excited to see where it goes from here.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyable, the critics are wrong (as usual).  The first truly fun movie in the MCU is a while!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed the movie. Don't go into it thinking Infinity War. Marvel peaked with that film. But Kang is fun, Scott is wholesome and it's more or less a family oriented Marvel film. Sets up for something else. or rather it's another piece to the MCU multiverse puzzle. Solid B from me."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it.  It's a super hero film so there's a lot to let go.  Rushed at first and felt a lot like a star wars film.  Once MODOK and Kang join in I thought the fun began.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Stop with the 5 star reviews! Those are for only perfect movies, and this was not a perfect movie.  That said, this will right the ship for Marvel. It had a lot of good stuff, and the future can build on it.  I would have liked more Kang instead of being told what Kang was, show us.  Thanos was a threat because we saw it visually.  I didn't hate it, but I had a good time, which is better than I can say for most of everything since End Game."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Exelente movie!!! Packed with action!!  I guess some critics are looking for something Shakespeare in it and don't value the movie for what is it
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It had great action and interesting new characters
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was great from beginning to end. Top tier marvel movie. Pay no attention to critics score. Must see in theaters.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have no idea why the critics had it out for this movie‚Ä¶this is by far the best Ant-Man movie, it's a killer start to phase 5, it was a blast and felt like a Star Wars mashup classic Sci fi adventure - but they gave us so much development with the characters, kang and the story going forward. 

If I'm really trying to be nitpicky there was a few editing weird choices in the first part and like 5% of the CGI needed more work. But that's looking for something to complain about. Don't listen to the critics here I promise. 

If you loved the Loki finale and all of that world and story building you will not be disappointed"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A fun romp, that gives us plenty of Pym/Lang/Van Dyne family dynamics, introduces Kang to the broader MCU and gets dark at times. I love that it is so different than the other two Ant Man films, even though those were cool too. The MCU beat goes on, bring on the Kang dynasty."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall it was a good movie. Had a few missteps, but definitely excited for the future of Kang in the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was an Ant-man movie. and I rather enjoyed it. just wish they didn't compare it to the likes of Civil War.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Sensacional. Me deixou ansioso pra o que vem por a√≠.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"amazing start for phase 5, absolutely had a blast. can't wait to see what happens next"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a crazy ride. Lots to love with this movie. Ignore the critics on this one. It's super fun, Kang is amazing, MODOK is a scene stealer, and the Ant family remains enjoyable to watch."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The plot was ordinary but I loved Kang
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"ant man 3 is best movie of all movie of the ant man movies kang was so good 
yes marvel big daddy is kang   I love the film"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are wrong. Movie is awesome.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Bro should have died, other than that it was a good movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful looking movie. Loved Kang, loved the father daughter moments, and loved the story. Marvel is back!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I just feel that they keep making the same mistake, very corny and too much comedy. LET ME FEEL THE SERIOUSNESS OF KANG. After End Game Marvel just gave upü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie ever made!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are absolutely wrong, Ant man and the Wasp 3 is brilliant!! I can't wait to see the havoc Kang brings to the MCU!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought that the movie was great!  I can't see what problems the critics are having.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyable, fast paced movie that is great 3D cinema. The best part after several MCU movies/shows pushing the wife and kids away, Ant-Man 3 is a winner. 

The post credits stingers work too. 

Not a Ragnarok, but I would put it way above most of the MCU movies. Really don't get the Eternals comparisons. Night and Day difference. Eternals is one of the worse. Ant-Man 3 one of the better.

Kang is a legit bad and the movie shows it and then some. The Pyms and Langs  
bond and positivity is refreshing. The dynamic runs the show for better and worse; drama can be fun too. The new characters could have a show of their own. Definitely glad it was crammed in here. The movie would have lost its way, but would love to see them in another medium.

Good one here."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love it! Fun and exciting, I'll be seeing it again soon."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was good but not great! With that being said the movie critics completely missed on this one, Jonathon Majors stole the show and Paul Rudd put on another great performance and left myself very excited for the future of the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just saw Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. I really liked it.

Pros:

Paul Rudd was amazing as Scott Lang as always. He knows how to bring emotion to the character.

Kathryn Newton was good as Casey Lang/Stature. 

The visuals were beautiful. They really made the Quantum Realm look and feel otherworldly.

The score was great.

The standout of the movie was Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror. He truly conveyed a demeanor of calm, calculated, and menacing. He made it known that is and will be a threat for rest of the Multiverse Saga.

Stay for the credits, two scenes set up things for the rest of the Multiverse Saga.

Cons:

For a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, you expect Evangeline Lilly‚Äôs character of Hope Van Dynne to get more focus or equal focus. She‚Äôs still being treated as a side character.

The plot is all over the place.

The ending was set up for something to happen, but it goes the opposite direction. 

Overall, Quantumania is a good movie that sets up the next big bad of the MCU. 

8.5/10 highly recommend"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Thought this was a really fun movie that introduces a new villain pretty well! Effects in the quantum realm were really cool to see. Def worth watching in theaters.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Went into this expecting something terrible but hoping for the best. The ""bad cgi"" is mostly from one character who is mainly comic relief. Ant-man or Paul Rudd does not get overshadowed in my opinion. If you expect Ant-man to be the dominant main character type like Iron Man or Cap then you are misreading his character. Jonathan Majors as Kang does shine pretty bright though, he was my favorite part of this movie. I had a great time watching this and the post credit scenes set up a lot of the next steps in the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun movie and don‚Äôt really understand the critic hate. Get the Star Wars comps though. Perfectly fun Marvel fare
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics are 100% wrong about this movie. This movie was great. Way better than Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. I think I might have even enjoyed it more than Wakanda Forever. I definitely liked it a lot better than the second film of the series Ant-Man and the Wasp.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was fantastic! JM crushed it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was honestly a refreshing entry for the MCU and a very respectable opening for Phase 5. This movie was excellent at handling both its lighter and heavier elements. The performances were all around very well done. On top of that, each of the main cast had a real moment in the spotlight. This movie had everything you would want to see in a super hero movie of its kind. My only criticism is about the quality of some CGI sequences, but even there it was not enough to throw of my enjoyment of this movie. Most of the criticisms leveled at the MCU recently seem to have been corrected in this movie. It was a very fun experience in the theater as well."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Simply one of the most generic things I've ever seen in my life, a mixture of A Bug's Life and Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over, that tires you out, doesn't excite you and has terrible taste for jokes.

The only things that save are Kang (and even then there are bad things at the end) and how the quantum realm was made, it's really beautiful"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is my first Rotten Tomatoes review ever. I had to come to the defense of this movie when I saw how critics were crushing the overall rating. Quantumania is incredible! This is the Marvel that so many longtime fans have been missing. Easily the best of all recent Marvel content; very high rewatch value. Stunning visuals - great new villains - sets up so many cool possibilities - great humor. This movie's overall fun factor is miles ahead of Eternals, Love and Thunder, and (controversial but brave) Wakanda Forever. I would watch this again right now just to see more Kang moments- so freakin good!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really fun and exciting, there was always a lot of action happening in the movie and doesn't leave you bored. It was also really funny and cracked me up every joke. And the actor for Kang the Conqueror did an amazing job at being Kang."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Beautiful world in the Quantum Realm.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Marvel movie since Endgame
They remembered how it's done somehow."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of fun to watch. Kang is everything we wanted.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,it's everything wrong with marvel
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I am curious about some of the ratings I've seen saying this movie isn't great. Yes all film is subjective but here we have a 2 hour marvel movie that gets to the point right away with an easy story to tell with great action and setting up a villain we already know after their second showing they are going to end up being on the greatness level of a Thanos/Vader. Simply put this movie is great nuff said. Cheers
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,uff kang is always daddy kang and paul rudd as always funny and awesome.. Must watch
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid addition to the MCU‚Ä¶Gave more depth to Ant-Man, but modok & kang stole the show "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid MCU film, not as funny or charming as the first two but still had it's moments of comedy and family. Kang is the highlight of the film."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was ok. If you like Star Wars then you will like this movie and it is better than what the critics say.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was entertaining. Modok was kinda weird looking in a not so good way even though he‚Äôs not supposed to look good‚Ä¶if that makes sense. But the story isn‚Äôt bad. It‚Äôs a good marvel movie. There are two post credit scenes, don‚Äôt miss them. The critics are wrong overall."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"MCU is dead, what a shite movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was best start to phase 5 of the multiverse saga and kang the conqueror in this movie was a bad ass during the fight with ant man and the army of quanta people. The family aspect of this film so very good. Man Modock in the film was Alright. Man the two post credit scene was the highlight of what's to come of kang. Get this movie 10/10
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the movie.  Im glad to have seen in 3-D!  The slower parts of the movie would have been hard to watch without the 3-D effects.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So this movie is a fun watch, but it's not among the best of the MCU or anything. I definitely got my entertainment out of it, but the whole middle of the movie is full of events and characters that just don't seem to weigh very heavily on the plot or main characters. The Quantum Realm is kind of an interesting place, but I don't feel like they made it feel like a place I want to visit again on rewatch. It's there, it's the setting of the story, and it houses some genuinely fun/funny moments, but it somehow feels small (ironically). The core story of the family and Kang is good, and Kang is an interesting character for sure, but the journey wasn't as memorable as I was hoping. If you like the MCU, I recommend it. If you don't, maybe watch this one on Disney+. It doesn't have the gravity and spectacle of some of the big hits, but it is fun if you're looking to go to the theaters this weekend."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly this movie is what I want new Star Wars content to be.   Absolutely loved it!  Great way to kick off phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"great movie, really entertaining and fun, action packed, this is what a big screen experience should be, Kang is great and Ant-Man and Wasp are stellar"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie wasn't what the critics were being negative about it. This movie was different in a good way. This time Michelle Pfeiffer got to shine and Jonathan Majors is KANG! Watch out. CGI was good even on MODOK I don't care what people say. I love the story, but it was just simple it's okay and I love Scott and Cassie father-daughter relationship. Wish we got more of Wasp. Those post credit scenes man, I'm hype. THEY are coming, HE is in trouble. QuANTuMANia was awesome and fun movie to watch in theaters and again and again!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,N√£o acreditem nas cr√≠ticas. Filme com falhas e defeitos igual todos. Assista o filme. Kang √© monstro. Tudo √© s√≥ o in√≠cio. Fique pras 2 cenas extras
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thoroughly enjoyed the story that was laid out in front of us, and it keeps you locked in through the whole experience.
The continues adventurers of Antman & Wasp through a whole new lens and a new villain introduced!

A definite must-see for those who enjoy the MCU in theaters!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great! Kang is going to be an incredible villain(s). Not sure about the bad reviews‚Ä¶ it's a Marvel Superhero movie and you get exactly that.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania promises an exciting future for the MCU with a stellar Jonathan Majors performance leading the way, but this third ""Ant"" outing lacks much of the pint-sized fun and charm of its predecessors and a rather bumpy start for the franchise's fifth phase!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie overall was not set to the intensity it was let them to be. With that being said however, the movie itself was a marvel film. Much like Dr strange with it's rushed being. The movie does slow down after a while as it's Anticipation builds up. Jonathan Majors play the role of king perfectly he truly is the embodiment of the roll. Paul Rudd's Antman remains a humorous character as he takes on a more serious role in the multiverse. Over all I give this movie a ""B"". The way they opened the doors to phase 5 is one of many directions, one things for sure. You never know what version of Kang we will see next."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Genuinely enjoyed it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Hilarious movie. Great end to the trilogy. Wish they spent more time on the visual effects but still a grey way to kick off the next phase. Jonathan Majors is amazing
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movie ever and the post credits uuuuufffff you better stay on your seat , this movie is just the beginning of a great dynasty ‚Ä¶"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-man 3 is a movie out of time. To slow, sloppy story and just odd. Gone are the days of the MCU we are in the era of let's just make a movie. Kang is great but even his greatness can't fix a bad plot. The MUC was built on story telling- something they and Disney have forgotten."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics are trippin‚Äô. This was a solid MCU movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Had some alright moments but a lot of wasted characters, cringey dialogue and super convenient plot moments for characters. Marvel needs to get it together and put out some bangers."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was really great! Definitely liked how they introduced Modok and Kang! Definitely worth to watch!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Actors did awesome especially Kang and Janet. This movie was just a little messy.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt bad. But i didn‚Äôt care for the ending. I hate when movies Hype up the villain just for him to be defeated so easily.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Comedic, Action, World Exploring, timed jokes and giggles, great ride, leaves more mysteries to come"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the introduction of Kang. I feel like they played his powers down by a lot but it was still a good movie. More Kang would have been nice!! Looking forward to the future variants of Kang tho.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Creo que mejora mucho en cuanto se refiere de fase 4 a 5, a mi gusto mi favorita de ant man y se puede sentir el poder de kang."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the burnt-out Marvel haters - the latest entry in the Ant-Fam corner of the MCU is awesome!  Paul Rudd is as delightful as ever, Michelle Pfifer kicks ass, and Michael Douglas gets to *finally* be a badass as well!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was way better than the last Dr. Strange movie. I think the professional critics have lost it on this one. Fun and entertaining. See it in the theater because it deserves a big screen.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing, it was a really good watch !!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, great story. Really loved what its about to setup in the next movies for sure"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jonathan Majors was excellent as Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics always being critics just trying to be heard by trying to dissect a movie when movies are just supposed to be entertaining. I was thoroughly entertained! Marvel always shows us something new we haven‚Äôt seen before!! KUDOS!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was very Disney influenced.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Ant-man movie yet
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant man was quite annoying, ""Kang the conqueror""  should've  been more of a CONQUEROR. But not taken down so easily by Ant man marvel did not do KANG THE CONQUEROR ""JUSTICE"" At all. This film could very well be the start to a dying age of good marvel movies. It used to be about true build up, story line and true villains who had strength and reign and POWER. Now the movies Marvel are producing aren't giving what their supposed to give. My suggestion to the producers give Another look at THE FOUNDATION of Marvel ""the comics"" and make the movies what people manna see. A well though out story line, action and epic bloody fights with villains who actually made the hero's Think twice about why they decided their path. Give me a hero who's been through something and suffered loss only to realize in their inner strength and wisdom for their success. I cant take marvel seriously right now."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Disney has turned marvel movies into complete trash‚Ä¶
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania was didn't have a dull moment in it. While being an Ant Man film, it also had to introduce the new big villain for the MCU. It still felt like an Ant Man film, and it actually had funny jokes. It was nice to see a Marvel movie that knew when to be funny and when it should take itself seriously."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed it! Kang was terrifyingly amazing!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic growth of the ant man story and amazing acting by Jonathan Majors. The world building of the MCU continues to get better.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely one way to start of Phase 5! Kang is definitely one villain not to mess with.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think all the parts that involved King the conqueror were absolutely amazing! However, everything else was kind of meh."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,overall I enjoyed the film. it had its ups and downs. some weird strange stuff throughout the film. the introduction to Kang was perfect. what I hated the most was Modok. also I missed seeing scotts pals in the film so that was a big bummer. loved the whole dynamic between him and his daughter grown up. definitely stay for the 2 end credit scenes. VERY important.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Had a great time! Had a great mix of comedy and action! Loved the Star Wars elements and costumes! A lot of work goes into these films! Phase V started with a BANG! BRING ON MORE KANG!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"MUITO RUIM KKKKKKK, FILME MED√çOCRE"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is basically the same format as the other Ant Man movies, not over the top just the way I like it. I watched it as if I was watching Loki Episode 7 and an extension of Antman 2. It's a very good set-up for the great multiversal war. It's a good movie not a great movie but it serves it purpose to set-up interconnected storyline. The only thing that is missing with this movie is Luis which is a bummer. 7/10"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Marvel needs to get back to earth based stories. They gave me no reason to care about the quantum realm. Only good thing to say is it wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄòLove and Thunder‚Äô
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Paul Rudd was great.  You could skip this.  It just looks unfinished and I don't follow this story.  It seems like a cartoon form script put into live action in a way.  But the CGI just fell flat at the big moments.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the money, it was visually stunning and the story was very interesting. I can't wait to see it again!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Kang The Conqueror"" was built up to be this big force, yet ""he"" couldn't survive one film. He who remains from Loki came off as a superior villain, this Kang was a let down. It was on the same level as Multiverse of Madness, and I was hoping it would be on the level of No Way Home.

Using MODOK for one movie again shows that the MCU can't keep any villain alive for more than a single movie unless it's Loki, or Thanos."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny yet thrilling 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely the biggest Ant-Man movie & almost epic. Jonathan Major's Kang is clearly the high point of the movie & if there was any one reason to go watch it would be him. Everybody else was okay but there were moments that were too Silly & even stupid. But overall it satisfied.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a great set up for the Multiverse Saga and Kang‚Äôs character
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome! By far the best Ant-Man movie and best Marvel movie I've seen in a while! Don't let the critics deter you!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a pretty good movie there was a few bits I didn't love but overall it felt better than most new marvel recently and I enjoyed it:)
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly it was actually a really good movie for comic book fans but for the everyday person would be confused of what's going on
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this film, it felt like a 1970's comic book. The bright colors and visuals combined with the science fiction premise made this feel fresh for a genre that is starting to outdo itself on how a real superhero would act.
I watch Marvel movies to escape, and this helped me escape. Ant-Man is already my favorite, and though this is nothing like the first two movies, I felt the characters all got the opportunity to show their previous charm.
They also did a great job of tying up loose ends from the first Ant-man while carving a path forward for Kang. And too much isn't enough to praise Jonathan Majors, dude can act. I will always love Paul Rudd.
I'm seeing it again tomorrow, no doubt. Say what you want about green screens and tired plots, blah blah blah, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania dazzled and entertained the heck out of me for 2 hours; that's why I go to the movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,The concept was ok but if you are into watching endgame with ants I say go for it!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania opens up phase 5 with a bang! Introducing us to the next big bad of the Multiverse Saga: Kang The Conqueror, played masterfully by Jonathan Majors. This film sets up the future of the MCU while giving us a fun adventure with the Ant-Man family."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dramatic, Whimsical, and fun. Certainly the best ant man, and a great introduction to Kang and all he will do."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent! Without leaving spoilers. Remember to stay for the credit and after the credits as well! You‚Äôre welcome.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was a good movie but its made me no longer want to watch marvel. white people winning against a black man is all this movie was at the end of the day
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was amazing!! I loved the plot and the storyline through it all :) I really like the antagonist and progranist match up in this!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Doesn't deserve the hate it gets. Fun family movie. Comedy was great. Beautiful scenery and world building. Kang was menacing. Overall a great and fun watch!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Typical Ant Man movie. Funny, entertaining, and better than the critics say."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it! Paul Rudd always brings the funny, along with the rest of the cast! The action and the quiet moments were good and the reintroduction of Kang the Conqueror played by Jonathan Majors was excellent!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Much better than the critics say! Not sure why they panned it!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,O my goodness. So freakin fun! It looked good! It was exciting!! Not a conclusion but the next logical story to tell about antman! Phase 5 is heating up!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Overall it's a fun time at the movies! While not my favorite Ant-man movie it delivers a sci-fi adventure with a great villain!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best Ant-Man movie I‚Äôve seen!!! It was great!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics. A big, fun movie that needs to be seen on the big screen."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Unique, unpredictable, and an entirely new universe! I throughly enjoyed Johnathon Majors‚Äô acting."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it! Don't listen to the critics. Definitely picked up in the second half. Had its funny moments. I'm just not a huge fan of so much CGI but I got use to it. Overall this was a solid opening to Phase 5!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The effects were amazing, I thought it carried the same classic tone as the rest of the Ant-Man trilogy and anything else with him. 

It definitely progressed the story arc a long greatly and gave an amazing look at Kang. 

I've come to realize something greatly, always take it into your own opinions and not that of others in your final choice. Even more critics, they might make you miss a fantastic movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"""It's never too late to not be a dick"" is something we all needed to hear"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had some pacing and story issues, but does excite us for the future."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Started off slow but was good once Johnathan Majors step on screen
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Was a little uneasy going in, having saw how low the critic ratings were, but I was pleasantly surprised. The action was pretty nonstop, the story didn't stagnate at all, and there were quite a few fun laughs in there. Was disappointed to see that a few characters from the first 2 Ant-Man movies did not make an appearance in this film, but hoping they come back next time. I'm excited to see the direction of MCU - setting up the next, big baddie. Looking forward to upcoming MCU films this year."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man is back, and he's smaller and funnier than ever! With his trusty sidekick, the Wasp, they shrink and enlarge to save the world again - this time, with a twist! The villainous Kang the Conqueror travels through time to stop them, and our heroes must race against time to stop him from destroying the universe. Watch as Paul Rudd brings the jokes and Evangeline Lilly brings the sass in this action-packed, quantum-fueled adventure. Just don't forget to bring your magnifying glass and insect repellent - it's going to be a wild ride!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I think uts the same kind movie with Antman and kang...killed my excitement for future movies...way more excited for DC
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had a blast with this movie. I do see some of the flaws, but I don't care. I think what works about the movie works great. Kang is awesome as the villain, and Paul Rudd is great."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was okay. I'd probably watch it over most of phase 4, but the first act for this movie was awful. But, once our characters started interacting with Kang, it picked up and really sold me on the character of Kang. Johnathan Majors did an excellent job. So, I was satisfied for the most part."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed! Kang steals the show!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. Best movie so far since endgame.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,At it's core it's an ant-man movie and that's what a lot of people forget. The quantum realm was amazing and Jonathan Major as Kang SHINES. The future of the MCU is looking bright as they tone down the comedy little by little. MODOK was the worst part of the movie and we could've done without him.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining movie that contributes well to the universe around it while still having its own identity. The CGI definitely had some subpar moments.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Is it perfect? No. Is it as bad as the critics say? No-er.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Quantumania is more or less! Weak script and full of holes, poorly developed characters... but there are good things... Majors is perfect as Kang and the CGI is acceptable! My grade is 5/10."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was amazing. Great way to introduce Kang the Conqueror. What I messed up on was buying the tickets to the movie with Spanish subtitles. Other than that, great movie, would definitely recommend to everyone!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Definitely must see if you are an antman fan but it's not super fast paced
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania expanded the MCU, introduced a compelling big bad, and likely sets us up for a wild ride in MCU phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Feels like a lot of franchises mushed together but really good action scenes but lost in its moral message and a great Kang setup.

Overall:3.5/5"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Idk if the critics and me watched the same movie but I thought it was really good Jonathon majors killed it as Kang I think it‚Äôs the best of the three just wow
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Expected a bad film turned into a film that I genuinely didn't expect to like at all
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Si quieres divertirte y entretenerte es muy buena peli, todo en ella tiene sentido, todos tienen sus minutos de protagonismo, es la mejor pel√≠cula de la saga de Antman! Kang se ve fuerte y tiene sus aires muy Star Wars de buena manera, no me aburri√≥ para nada, es una pel√≠cula simp√°tica"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,this movie looks like a patchwork quilt
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, do not pay attention to the ""critics"" go and have your own opinion. It is funny, entertainment and perfect for all the ages."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"rotten tomatoes has once again thrown this movie away when in facts is actually enjoyable and well paced. only complain in MY OPINION is during the second act, it felt a bit all over the place. but then found itself at a good track."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. Had everything you need. Laughs, seriousness, and excitement. Must watch"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Antman and the Quantum Universe was soso.

Have started to wonder if the MCU is unintentionally trivializing genocide. Destroying a building in the story isn't shocking enough in the sequel, so in the next sequel they have to destroy a city, then a country, then a planet, then planets, then half the population of the universe, then an entire universe, then multiple universes, then infinite universes. Infinite genocides? Then perhaps the potential conversion and teaching value of the topic becomes just a profitable franchise product. Feel free to disagree."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania¬†it's fun, silly, and very Star Wars-ie, and that isn't bad.
Go watch it with no expectations, have a laugh, you'll enjoy it better, and take it just for what it is: a comic book movie, an Ant-Man Movie, with an amazing cast, Michelle Pfeiffer is just üëåüèª"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought it was a fun, entertaining ride.  Does it have room for improvement, of course. But Jonathan Majors is a force, who may have had to  put this movie on his back! Its a little wacky & crazy, but it was enjoyable. Definitely great to watch in the theatre."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie captured how Scott Lang is a different type of hero than the rest. Jonathan majors did a phenomenal job as Kang, but the movie has multiple downsides. There was no Luis in it. There was no talk about what happens to ghost and the post credits scenes were confusing AF. The council of Kangs looks like a group of people who escaped a mental asylum. And what was going on with Loki and mobius. Now let's talk about Modok. It was a great idea to make Derren Cross modok was genius, but we did not need to see his butt. They also made it look like Derren/modok was high for the entire movie, and it was a terrible idea for him to become good at the end. This was such a waste of modok, and kang. Did he die!! I thought that that variant would be the new thanos,  not due in his first movie?? Overall the movie was pretty good, but it was more like a goofy ah Thor movie not an ant man movie. I give it 4 stars."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I thought it was so much fun. Some of the previous MCU movies have been to goofy, and while this one is goofy in a lot of ways, it fits in the Ant-man world. I thought the silly worked better here than let's say Love and Thunder. Anytime Kang was on screen he was super menacing and very interesting. Jonathan Majors was an awesome villain as Kang and I can't wait to see what else he does. Phase 5 festivities has begun!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Beautiful VFX. Mid storyline? I‚Äôm not sure
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome. Marvel does it again changing it up with a pure science fiction movie. Critics won't like it but Marvel fans will. Kang is going to wreck the MCU.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was funny, entertaining, fun, really corny, but really good"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme n√£o √© terr√≠vel igual muitos cr√≠ticos est√£o dizendo, ele tem seus erros mas entrega muita divers√£o e um √≥timo vil√£o para o filme e para as fases da marvel! As cenas p√≥s cr√©ditos s√£o arrepiantes, n√≠vel Thanos em Vingadores 1! Filme bem legal, 8/10!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the bros and haters. This is a really good movie. It's better than most of the phase I movies and phase II movies other than Captain America. It's not a joke fest like some of the recent Marvel. The jokes fit the characters. The quantum realm is the micronauts that I always wanted to see. It has twists and turns and all of the characters get to shine. Loved it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie wasn't perfect I was really looking forward to some things I didn't get but what it brought to the table was great. It opened a can of ants, on the marvel universe.  I can see why the critics rated it lower, there is a white privilege theme which if you think the biggest picture it's all about conquering the little guy.  Great Sci fi adventure on its own six legs as well."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was Beautifully well balanced between a funny & serious tone. This is the best Ant-Man movie yet out of the trilogy, it starts off with a fast intro & then quickly smooths into a fast transition of action with ongoing continuity of action. Movie had so many meaningful messages & heart felt warming scenes with at the same time having that heart rushing adrenaline cause of how serious the stakes were in this movie dealing with a Villain on a bigger scale than the previous. Movie was great overall in all areas, the only down side of it, was not being longer because that‚Äôs how good it was. Movie had me so hooked that it left me wanting more like how infinity war did when Thanos snapped half the universe away.. 11 out of 10"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics have to be critical, I guess. That's their job, right? I doubt every one of them saw all previous 20+ movies. You have to to know what incursions are and to get multiple explanations of how the multiverse works you have to watch all the movies. That's what's at stake! Everything! If Kang the Conqueror gets out from where (quantum realm) the council of Kangs ((Kangs from each universe) also end credits scene) banished him, then there will be war as he attempts to conquer the multiverse. The movie ends with us not knowing where he was transported to. Likely setting up him being in a position to start his plan of destruction. There are huge stakes and also humor throughout. For those saying we don't get a close to the Antman trilogy, Scott and Hope started as her not being able to stand him and now come together for and ""I love you"" scene. That's the close. This move introduced Kang at minimal power and set him up as the big bad moving forward. I'm not saying it was perfect, but there was nothing to dislike except MODOK. That was a weird take on MODOK if you're a Comic MODOK fan. If you're a fan of marvel you will like this movie‚Äîway more than Thor L&T and better than Wakanda Forever. Also, that's Ram-Tut, Immortus, and Kang Prime in the end credits. Look them up!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,My ratings it‚Äôs better than MOM and Thor 4 probably around a 72 or so. Humor was received well through audience. Only downside is they botched MODOK a but not enough to take away from Jonathan Majors Performance.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't believe the overly negative reviews, it was honestly one the best super hero movies in recent years. Probably the best MCU movie post-pandemic. All the actors were great, the writing was great, it had a lot of humorous and suspenseful moments. It also finally got me feeling good about the MCU's phase 5. The recent movies were making phase 5 feel like it was going to not be exciting, but Ant-Man 3 blew away my doubts. The MCU's future is looking up again."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"i love how they introduce M.O.D.O.K in MCU and Kang, they love to try something to explore every scene. i enjoy it and most of all the post and end credit scene."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,building the multiverse. whichever critics didn't like this I think missed the boat. phase 5 and 6 are going to be epic!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely a must see for Marvel fans
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was a solid B film for me. Not nearly as powerful as Infinity War or Endgame, but more more watchable than Thor Love and Thunder."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I don‚Äôt why people are so negative about this movie. I really enjoyed myself and I‚Äôm so excited for what this movie is settling up with the future of the MCU
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was better than the Rotten Tomatoes score but not a great Marvel movie. Deserves around a 80-85% score
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. Los criticos me chupan los huevos...
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie and Its not nearly as bad as the critics make it out to be. The CGI is a lot better then the last few marvel movies. I think it helps set up the next phase nicely with Kang. There are two post credit clips that help set things up. People may say its a movie to skip but I don't feel that way it defiantly a movie to watch.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Personally thought it was great! Don't get what the negative hype was about. Use of the volume vs green screen wasn't bad either.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So when I heard about this movie I couldn't wait to see it, right before I could see it I heard the reviews were bad. So I went to see it today with low expectations as I didn't care much for Thor love and thunder as I would have hoped. Let me say not only is this the best antman movie, but its also pretty decent, my only thing I could say should have changed is kang was a bit of a let down in power wise but yeah 3.5 maybe a 4 star movie and I most likely will rewatch in a week or 2."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great start to the new phase of the MCU
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Ant man movie. Highly recommended.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,So weird but not bad as the critics state‚Ä¶..like Star Wars meets Avatar‚Ä¶..Jonathan Majors with the win as Kang‚Ä¶..can‚Äôt wait to see more of him‚Ä¶..and MODOK‚Ä¶.the scene stealer üòÇ
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"love the movie, enjoyed it , lot of fun, best of ant man movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,The critic's got this one right the movie is all over the place but kang is the star of the movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan majors as Kang and Michelle Pfeiffer steal the show! The movie really takes off 20 mins into it and now I can't wait for more Kang and the next phase of MCU! Stay for the post credit scenes. Overall Very fun, don't listen to the critics‚Ä¶AGAIN!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is one of the best experiences I have had watching a marvel movie, I always have fun watching them, the movie seemed very short to me, at the end I was like, PLEASE DON'T FINISH YOURSELF, I loved the effects, kang is very scary and da who knows what is coming, the quantum world is incredible and beautiful, the actors showed off, they did not give their best performance but it is enjoyable in the way they did it, I loved this movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked a lot the movie. I've been a Marvel Fan since the comics and 90's cartoons. I'm amazed every time they bring to life the characters I was reading and watching since I was a kid. A lot of the bad reviewers come from people that either are super freaks of the comics and want everything by the book or new fans that are used to the Phase1-phase3. I'm 40 years old,  I loved the movie and every time I'm at that theater seat, I feel like the kid I used to be every time when got out from elementary school to watch the cartoons or read the comics."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"good movie, said bad not too bad and said good not too good.  In terms of storytelling, it is good enough to introduce a big villain, very fitting to start a phase.  cgi that spoils the eyes like watching star wars.  8/10 from me"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not really sure what movies the critics watched, but this was a good movie. Much better than Thor and in my opinion better than Wakanda forever. Definitely my second favorite antman after the first one. I would give it an 8/10"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The plot was great and fully realized. The graphics and CGI were amazing as well. The end credits scenes were pivotal. Overall a really amazing movie and cant wait for it to come out on streaming.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,If you're a marvel fan you'll definitely enjoy the movie. I think it's sets the stage excellently for the coming phase. Those who might not appreciate it too much now will in the future. If you read the comics you'll definitely see why I said that! Johnathan Majors was stellar as Kang
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,give it a 6/10 way to predictable and so many plot wholes it looked like the roads in Oklahoma.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was way better than critics said it was.  I really liked it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was incredible.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you were disappointed in what Phase 4 of the MCU had to offer, this movie will almost surely give you more hope for what's to come. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania does an amazing job at blending the lightheartedness and humor of the previous two Ant-Man movies with the serious ""Avengers Level Threat"" which is Kang The Conqueror. Amazing entry into the Marvel Cinematic Multiverse."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Phenomenal Film. The Entire theater was absolutely entertained!!!! I loved the 3-D and the effects with vibration seats üí∫ top tier!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Another quality installment in the Antman world. Jonathan Majors is a force. Good fun. Stay for the post credits!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Mostly quite entertaining, but couldn't escape some weird ""is this a Star Wars movie?"" vibes now and then.  The Quantum Realm looks surprisingly like space.  Overall, an enjoyable experience and worth seeing."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a fun entry to the MCU. I don't expect it to win any Oscars for best movie or anything but is a great popcorn flick. Visually it is beautiful and it paves the way for Kang the Conquerer to really replace Thanos as the next big bad.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just go and watch, I loved it."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,I give it a C+. definitely enjoyable and action packed. I enjoyed the story and look forward to other content because of it. stay until the end.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It‚Äôs not the best of the MCU, by far, but it is entertaining. Jonathan Majors was excellent. "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie worthy the money absolutely
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not the worst marvel movie. But nowhere near the best or even mediocre.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"LOVED THIS MOVIE, great way to start the Phase!!! Jonathan Majors and Kathryn Newton Killed it!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"ABSOLUTE DOGSH*T, I thought phase bore was over but apparently not, F the MCU please stop spamming out bad movies and focus on quality....a**holes."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Really enjoy it. Only complaint were the jokes at serious moments. Post credit scenes were amazing. I can't wait for the future of the MCU and where they take Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Really liked Cassie and Jonathan Majors is a fantastic Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Do Not listen the critics and the haters. This is a fun & amazing movie. I‚Äôm ready for Phase 5 & 6 !!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie! I fully enjoyed the story, the action, the characters, and the sets/designs. Kang is definitely a top villain for me!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This Movie could be one of the worst for other critics in my opinion This Movie had more action to it Modok was Incredible ‚ù§Ô∏è But Kang Little Creepy but Intense as well I really like this movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Almost every aspect in this film is fun, drama, and cruelty from Kang can be felt. Even though it was only a glimpse of Kang's background, I quite understand how Kang felt and why he did that. A good enough film to open Phase 5 Multiverse. Can't wait for Kang in other films to conquer Marvel!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is great, i like it. and kang in this film it so scary villain, i thing mcu next film is gonna great"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was great and wasn‚Äôt bad
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's good movie u feel kang present good start to phase 5 but even prove more why critics can't be taken serious
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very fun movie. And if that's what your looking for, it delivers."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Buena peli, algo floja en cuanto a trasfondos pero entretenida."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"What are the critics thinking. This was better than Doctor Strange. They explained Quantum realm and even the multiverse better.  Did anyone else got a Stars Wars vibes; specially all the different species at the Bar and the ending big fight with everyone.  My only issue is that the focus more on Casey and Janet than actual Ant-man. His ending fight scene was good though. I also enjoyed the way they portrayed Modok, it was a good comic relief and i don't think I would have taken it serious if they tried to make him different. Finally, don't even get me started with the post credits scene straight out of the comic‚Ä¶.. I just have one thing to say about Kan: Brilliant.  He may be my new favorite Marvel villain."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I wanted it to be good. We all needed it to be good. It was not good. RIP theaters.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"where I agree with critics- some of the visuals are sludgy- could be brighter; more colour and clarity. I imagine the quantum realm as being more sparkly; but using multiple fx houses- the one way to guarantee smooth blending is to tone down the brightness... hides flawed overlap. 
on the whole the story moved along; just enough exposition to justify things; Bill Murray wasn't as gratuitous a presence as I'd expected, and I'm feeling Jonathan  Major's Kang as more of a true threat. totally surprised by MODOK. not as much feel-good schlock in this film as I'd expected, so accepted the MODOK storyline as it played... and multiple Chekhov's gun moments... the smart ant colony being the best, though it can be argued Yellowjacket flashback was one.  better movie than your critic reviews gave the impression..."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,That was a really fun and exciting adventure! Jonathan Majors crushed it as Kang again and the movie really balanced the tone well with the seriousness and levity. The Quantum Realm and its inhabitants were incredibly creative and interesting. Paul Rudd is as likeable as always but also really gets to truly play the hero and has some good dramatic moments in this one.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good but not great. Enjoyable time at the theater. More excited about the future possibilities. This felt like a mere set up for upcoming projects.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible film with stunning visuals and amazing performances all around, that sets up so, so much for the future of the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a real fun ride! I enjoyed the Sci Fi feel of the movie! Absolutely loved Jonathan Majors as Kang! Can't wait to see what comes next with this new big bad of the MCU!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cool technology, impressive visuals, talented cast, and hilarious gags. This might well be one of the best MCU movies ever. I'm so glad I went to see it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoy the movie, it was awesome!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I‚Äôm conflicted on this one.

I really enjoyed the overall story and the character of Kang (who Jonathan Majors plays viciously)‚Ä¶ and, of course, Rudd who is always a joy to watch. 

However, this movie feels largely unfinished‚Ä¶ at least in the VFX department‚Ä¶. and that‚Äôs not the departments fault‚Ä¶ I largely feel it is due to Marvel rushing to get these films out. I understand that these films are, and always have been and will be, filmed in front of a green screen‚Ä¶ but at times you can absolutely tell where the green screen ends and the cheap looking props begin, which made the world they were trying to build feel incredibly small. I swear 90% of this, Thor: Love and Thunder and some of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse were filmed in the exact same ‚Äúgreen screen dome‚Äù with a ‚Äúcatwalk‚Äù like platform in the middle. Don‚Äôt even get me started with the M.D.O.K VFX, although I did get a kick out of the character. 

There is a lot to love about this movie and with some VFX updates (like with No Way Home and Love and Thunder) or a less rushed production schedule (so more time could be spent on the effects) my score will probably dramatically jump higher. In it‚Äôs current form‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs honestly kind of embarrassing."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm honestly not sure why the film is getting such poor reviews. This film was a night and day improvement over the previous Ant-man film which was pretty inconsequential. This movie had a ton of visual flair, an exciting plot and a wonderful villain in Jonathan Major's Kang the Conquerer. This was as close as the MCU ever got to feeling like Star Wars. I feel like this was one of the least jokey Marvel movies in a while. They perfectly balanced the comedy and action."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just saw it. I honestly do not get the ‚Äòcritic' review scores. It was good. Not great but much better than most of Phase 4 of the MCU. 

If you like the MCU or Sci-fi action movies this is pretty good. I would put it in the middle of the pack of the MCU movies so far. CGI was amazing, fights were good, pacing was good, plot was serviceable enough to move the movie along to its conclusion. And of course it ties in to the overall Kang arc of the MCU but it's worth a watch even if you're not a fanboy."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are full of it. The film isn't perfect but, it isn't horrible. Quantumania mostly does setup for future entries but, it is joyful in it weirdness. The moments where Kang is threatening are genuinely intimidating AND the third act is fun but, it's rushed. They do waste Bill Murray though, he's basically a glorified cameo. All in all, this isn't in my top 5 but, it's not in my bottom 10."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect set up for Kang the Conqueror! Jonathon Majors was great at portraying a terrifying and powerful villain that will be very impactful for the MCU moving forward.  Also nice to see Ant Man take on some more powerful people and show his full skill set.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than I expected!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Over all very enjoyable even though the story was a bit predictable
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie probably one of my favorite marvel movies
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely had a star wars film feel in terms of aesthetic. But instead of space, it's the quantum realm. The humor was dialed down a bit from previous films but it wasn't an issue. MODOK looked like MODOK and very cool to see Marvel actually go with that design, even if it was goofy; it still worked. Kang was great. The lingo and terminology regarding his future is exciting, but definitely not the easiest to follow of you haven't kept up with the films/shows (or thr comics to some extent). Overall, highly recommend."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"star wars, avatar, and ragnarok all mixed together. not done well at all."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Movie was very scattered and storyline wasn't good ... plus alot of the cgi was bad its like they didnt spend time to making it believable and cut corners for cost purposes or something.  I havent seen a good antman movie since the 1st one . Marvel is in decline,  I should of known this would happen"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,If you love sci-fi you'll love this movie!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,As everyone knows. Marvel movies are like fast food. They're ok they do what there supposed to do. Sometimes people crave a good mcchicken. That's what Marvel movies usually are. If you go in expecting a masterpiece. You'll be disappointed. If you go in there excpecting a fast food type movie. You'll enjoy it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The only problem with movie was it's run time .. it should be longer.. as you can't saw that much content in just 2 hours...
Expect that everything was just great"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was the best of the trilogy by a mile! The visual effects were absolutely stunning, Rudd and Major's performances were awesome and nailed damn near to perfection, and actually builds to something that is going to go down later in the future of the MCU. GIVE IT A WATCH YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The CGI was not as bad as I thought it would be. The plot was much different than I imagined, but I enjoyed every second and loved this movie! What a great way to alter the course of the MCU!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It‚Äôs a fun movie, I had fun"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow! Thats all i can say!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite it being a green screen movie, it was definitely the best Ant-Man movie to date. Majors is the perfect choice for Kang. The future is terrifying, and I can't wait!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved everything about Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantamania, as I'm excited to see what's in store for the future of the MCU!! Next up, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 in May!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great visuals‚Ä¶Kang is the TRUTH!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Thought movie was good. Can't understand how so many critics didn't like this
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The fact that the critics rated this movie worse than Thor 4 is absurd.  This is a very solid film and I have a feeling most other Marvel fans will agree.  Please don't listen to the critics and go see the film to make your own decision!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's hard to trust critics when they give a MCU entry like She-Hulk 80%, but give this less than 50%. Word to the wise, don't listen to them. This is a fun MCU entry to kick off Phase 5. It's not perfect nor is it the best MCU project, but it is a wonderful addition to the Multiverse Saga, and a pleasant taste of what's to come. Kang is amazing, the movie is wacky, and the after-credit scenes will get you excited for the next entry. "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantum-mania was like a Rick and Morty episode! It was a blast! No complaints!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fun! Kang was great and so was Paul Rudd. Some things missed (a few weird continuity errors) and I didn't actually know how it would end (other than the ants) which is always fun! Can't wait for the future of marvel!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lazy writing and directing. Inconsistencies throughout. Somehow not a true ""wow"" moment despite having an entirely new world at their disposal with unlimited creativity. Very little connection or character development amongst the characters. Did Disney really lower the standards this much for marvel in just 5 years?"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had a blast watching this movie from beginning to end. From the incredible pacing to the well-done humor, everything seemed to tie together in such a beautiful and fluent fashion. The movie did an incredible job of telling the story that it wanted to tell. It set up for everything that it wanted to set up for while also maintaining the theme that Ant-Man has always offered in previous installments. It is very rare that a movie leaves me speechless, but this one did. I may even return to the theater to watch it a second time! What a wonderful experience."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kang got beat by Ant man. No offense but he is no Thanks.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was great. It followed the new story like and it relates to the other worlds we see in guardians and trippiness of dr strange. If you didn't see Loki you may be lost and if you have no bearing of Kang the same but overall great and leading to bigger things
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a return to form for Marvel. While not the cream of the crop, we got a fun time at the movies and I am excited to see what is next."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great. It had the humor of the previous Antman films but was still serious enough for the introduction of Kang and set up the next phase of the MCU.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jonathan majors was cool, wish he was a little more threatening but I guess they‚Äôre saving that. Cassie was super annoying like whys she beating on her father so much? Dude saved the whole planet she wants him to do more?????????????? She‚Äôs just annoying all around and I feel they‚Äôre stupefied most of the characters. Hope was one of the good parts of the movie too, barely spoke though. But yeah, boring and not much made really any sense like why is anyone doing anything they‚Äôre doing?"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ok so a lot to unpack here‚Ä¶ Kang is amazing and the CGI is incredible! now this comes not in anyway feel like and Antman movie but more like a Quantum Realm Movie. I enjoyed all the comedy of this movie as well and the comedy was not over taking the movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania got pretty cool World there, very Star Wars ish. Johnathan Majors did fantastic job in his role as Kang, the Conqueror. I can‚Äôt wait to see him again for Marvel movies. It‚Äôs a pretty decent start of Phase 5 MCU. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania movie is 6/10."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Totally loved this movie if your an ant man fan you'll enjoy it . Loved the sci fi aspect and bizarreness of the quantum realm. Had a fun time at the theatre was in between 3.5 to 4 but kang definitely pushed it to that my fav of the ant man and if your a marvel fan and want to have a nice time at the theater I would recommend it
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie is a lot of fun. Majors and Rudd are excellent and the supporting cast is utilized perfectly. It does get a little messy at times story wise but this was a great introduction for Kang and the post credit scenes set up a lot for the future. It definitely has major Star Wars vibes and at times it was a bit much. MODOK was absolutely hilarious and goofy. Might have two of the best post credit scenes of all Marvel movies. Don't listen to the critics. A bunch of snobby elitists who don't know how to have a good time and think every Marvel movie needs to be End Game.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not enough story. A lot of great moments,but not much really...happened. The trailers showed way too much"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lots of CGI and little else, missing most of the humor and personality that made the previous two movies so much fun. At least it made The (also underwhelming) Flash seem better by comparison!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Joyous, exciting, surrealistic, psychedelic ride‚Äîcomplete with social revolution and multidimensional techno-socialist super ants. What more could we ask for?"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was good, felt a little slow paced at times but the action, humor and story definately made up for it.  Loved seeing Cassie as part of the family and the team as 2 different aspects and seeing her and paul rudd fibal interacting as father and daughter really gives some great vibes. 
 Jonathan Majors as kang was brilliant, he makes an awesome villain(s) and i cannot wait to see what marvel does with him across the next 2 phases, i am so excited it felt like a good classic marvel movie, and ""my name, is darren and i am not a dick"", and finally a return to 2 end credit scenes, stay till the end, its definately worth it."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was better then Thor love and thunder ü§£
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a beginning, not and end. It definitely has a different tone than the others but I was engaged throughout and am excited for what comes next. It feels like LOTR The Two Towers"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Aside from a few cases of conflicting tone and a shotgunned first act, Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania delivers laughs, tension and great visuals all on a grand scale. Also, Kang is a top tier villain played perfectly by Jonathan Majors."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie, like almost every Marvel film and show released in the last two years, is about more than a standalone story and is written to tell a much larger and ambitious story. Yes, to fully understand and keep up with plot points surrounding this film, one would need to have invested time into other MCU properties. Otherwise you wouldn't understand the gravity of Kang, and you won't be totally sold on what this film is attempting to do; Deliver another fantastic, redundant, entertaining superhero film in the largest, most expansive story ever put to film.

Quantumania has loads of charm and while it isn't the best film ever, it is another great addition to the MCU.


Just because you're sick of Marvel being good, doesn't mean it's bad.

Thor was bad. This movie is not."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another goofy light-hearted movie to add to the Ant-Man franchise with a sufficiently intimidating villain in Kang! Kang's performance is spectacular, the Quantum Realm is gorgeous, and it explains the multiverse in a relatively easy-to-understand way (all things considered). Not the best MCU movie ever made but full of heart, an amazing end to Ant-Man's trilogy, and a thrilling set-up for Kang Dynasty!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was movie ok. Kang was absolutely amazing. The story was messy, jokes were hit or miss, CGI heavy. It's hard making a movie with a grounded character in a big scale story. Can't wait to see more of Kang. But this movie was meh."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!  Really set up the future. It's going to get really interesting! Let's goo!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very Scifi and a great introduction to the new big bad of the MCU.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly the movie under delivered. There is too much ‚Äòavatar' going on In this movie. The comedy was fine, acting was great, the story was a little rushed, messy and overcrowded, the end wasn't that good, the sequence before the ending was good. The Best part about the movie was the post- and endcredit scenes because it gave us an insight of the future of marvel. It is an antman movie even though you get the feeling of it isn't. I Got to give probs to Jonathan majors, an amazing actor and he really showed In this movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Majors as Kang is something to behold. The rest of the movie is whatever.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So much of what happens in this movie can be liked or disliked. Do you like the cgi because it's interesting to look at or dislike it because it's technically average cgi. Can you make sense out of all the plot holes and contrivances? Did you like both halves of the movie or prefer one? Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania has odds stacked against it because the way it is designed to go for the extremes of the type of experience it wants you to have.

The extremes in question is technical aspects of the filmmaking (cgi, fight scenes, script) but also the tone. The ideas feel much larger than the movie lends itself to be. The fight scenes go from can go from well shot to disorientating. Script is seemingly full of plot holes, but also feels as if fans could have answers to everything. The movie seems to casually move about without trying to answer many questions I had regarding plot holes/contrivances. It wants you to just accept how it gets from point A to Z.

I enjoyed the cgi. It wasn't ""great"" cgi, but I liked the way it looked for the world that it's set in. I also had some laughs, enjoyed many of the action scenes, and enjoyed Bill Murray a lot. Unfortunately, most everything I liked was in the first half of the movie. After the introduction of the villain, I slowly lost interest. 100 minutes in, the movie felt like it outstayed it's welcome. What happened was Ant Man decided to go larger and thus failed to feel darker. I much preferred the more simple story that was being set up before the real story came in to play."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Most disappointing movie I've seen in a long time, might even be worse than Thor 4"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved it, my favorite of the trilogy. Kang was epic!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure where all of the critical hate is coming from. This was the best MCU movie since No Way Home and if you take the Spider-Man movies out, the best since Endgame. Pure fun - No Politics(there's even a joke in there about no one wanting to hear about politics)"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania kicks off phase 5 of the MCU. The film itself is wildly uneven, with sloppy storytelling, unexplained ‚Äúrules‚Äù of the world the film sets up, and not enough thrills to distract from those problems. However, with standout performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Johnathan Majors the movie still commands attention. Overall, it‚Äôs a lackluster beginning to the next phase of the MCU but if you‚Äôre a fan I would give it a whirl."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun and entertaining film!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors was amazing . Can‚Äôt wait to see more of Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie had a lot of potential however the movie is predictable, story is not good, the fact that they just warp to the Quantum realm in the beginning looked so cheesy. they also used a cut scene very similar to doctor strange going through the Quantum Realm similar to the multiverse felt copy-paste. overall terrible movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Dope movie! Must watch!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Nice bookend to the Antman Trilogy.   Absolutely LOVED Jonathan Majors as Kang.   Such a talented actor.   Great to see Bill Murray hasn't lost his acting chops.  Paul Rudd is hilarious as always.   I'd see it again.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wooe man,, what a movie. Paul Rudd doing Welcome back Cotter,,  Michel P doing Catwomen, Bill Murry still doing Ghost Busters, and the rest of the cast from Lost in Space, and Wakanda. CGI was left over from Avatar, that didn't cut it.. Some scenes in 3d were outstanding, but for the most part it was a dark movie. Premise is weak at best... where Penny from Lost in Space is tinkering with the Quantum Universe transporting device and oooops it works and sucks them all in,, now the fight to get back. Its a nice movie and it runs from here to there,, so yea, its not the best, but considering what Hollywierd putting out,, you might as well see this disaster of a Marvel movie. All the acting, was any thing but connecting to each other..so a straight D minus for all the acting. Was there any thing good about this movie,,, yes,, It ended, 2 hrs and 5 minutes,,thank god I didn't watch any previews. Well I go see it again, if I need a nap.   D minus  Poor Regal Cinemas cant get a break with rotten movies. I wonder if any one reads this?"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! I don't understand the rotten tomato score. Glad I didn't listen to it. Definitely waaaaay better than eternals and very excited about Kang the conqueror and where this it's all headed
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Didn‚Äôt disappoint, that‚Äôs for sure! You have to live Paul Russ‚Äôs sense of humor, and it really shines!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was great, just finished watching it and I thought it was superb. Acting was amazing, visual effects were stunning. The origin for Janet and Nathaniel, getting an in depth look to the Quantum Realm. Modem was 50/50 could've been better, but maybe we'll get a better one in the future. But still, it was cool to see characters back from the first and direct callbacks to other movies. Loved the relationship between Paul Rudd and Kathryn Newton. 10/10 . The ending was hilarious, perfect comedy moments with Scott and glad to see Kang done right in the MCU. All in all, just a good fun time with amazing actions. Can't wait for more."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this movie did everything it was supposed to do while still being a true Ant Man film. It sets up phase 5 beautifully, you can feel the stakes and the tension. There's definitely some things I would change and that I didn't think were great, but this is a really solid MCU film and I had a blast with it."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania explores so much of the MCU, and a wonderful movie to kick off Phase 5. The movie didn't feel like it was the final Ant Man film and more of the start of the Kang story. Jonathan Majors portrayed Kang amazingly, and I left the cinema so excited to see where his story goes. The post credit scenes were spectacular. Overall this film was a great way to start Phase 5 and kick off the Kang Dynasty."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Apparently it's a hot take , but I found Quantumania to be a lot of fun! I honestly think that a lot of the casual MCU movie goer may be suffering from Marvel fatigue, and that's perfectly fine. If you're a Marvel fan though, you'll be fully invested and enjoy the movie. Kang stole the second half of the movie , and the post credits scenes (yes there are two) both have me looking forward to more of what Phase 5 has to offer!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It may be fair that the casual film-goer will be confused. Perhaps you do need to review Loki season 1 like the Zapruder film to understand some of the dialogue. But if you do, it completely pays off. The tone of the film is surprisingly lighthearted in spots, consistent with the other franchises, advances the on-going story of Lang (the maturation of a man who feels small, driven to get better by his daughter) and delivers impressive visuals and wild new characters. All MCU projects borrow from other franchises (Loki from Dr. Who, Wandavision from 90s TV, etc.), so there is a clear Star Wars reference. But all the better. A critic may note some thin character arcs (Wasp), or that the parts where the characters get separated are a tad longer than they need to be, but the film overall was immensely enjoyable and had a much smaller scope than The Eternals, which critics also complained about being too grandiose. Great action, true to the trilogy, smart and funny, great ending.... ignore the haters."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Holy cow.. I loved it. I really don't why it is such a bad score on RT!

MCU fans will love the continuity. 

Kang was amazing. Just incredible. A true threat. Majors was so badass. 

Loved the comedy. Didn't think it was corny? I found myself chuckling quiet a bit!

Most importantly I was never taken out if it. I kept wondering where ""the story fell apart""   and didn't find that part at all??"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was honestly the best marvel film since endgame for me and up there with NWH IMO
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't understand the bad reviews. Felt like a cross between Avengers and the Star Wars movies. Loved it and can't wait to see more of Jonathan Majors
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,great Movie !! laugh alot
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Hollywood writing is where creativity goes to die. These franchise films are so bad.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Johnathon Majors Kang is fantastic. Good humor. Would have liked more of Kang‚Äôs story though. Post credit scenes worth waiting for.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok. Dragged a little. Kang was uneventful. Modok was cgi death. Story was ok. I wouldn't see it again.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don't know why everyone is clowning on this movie. It's not horrible. I really enjoyed myself with it‚Ä¶..


MODOK sucked though. :)"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good watch. Didn‚Äôt go in with any expectations and genuinely enjoyed the experience.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Has the right blend of Marvel comedy hijinks and serious plot moving the MCU forward. One of the better installments of recent Marvel movies.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a fun popcorn movie. Paul Rudd is still funny and witty. The plot makes sense as something bigger is coming. I like Jonathan Major and look forward to want else he brings to the MCU.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Omg they wasted kang and scott in this movie too many unfunny jokes parts that are supposed to be serious are not leaning into it and some scenes were just dumb üôÑ in case of kang giving a whole speech instead of jumping into the portal he's supposed to be very smart after all and he gets defeated at the end of the movie he's supposed to be the biggest menace of all the kangs they all fear him, a million of them and he's defeated that easily whoever wrote the scripts for this movie didn't imagine hard enough on kang"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great acting and the right balance of humor. Scott and Hope's relationship gets completely overshadowed by Scott and Cassie, but the father daughter storyline provided a great motivation to move the plot forward. I enjoyed the otherworldly-ness of the movie and it is a good thing anytime a movie can bring you into original new world. Phase 5 off to a great start!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie NEEDED to happen in order to pave the road for phase five. Once you take a look at the bigger picture you realize this film is actually good and don't get me started about the two end credit scenes ahhh!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even when it isn't one of the best Marvel movies, I can say it delivers. The villain is fantastic, nice views, and the story is entertaining. Some plot holes and many deus ex machina events, but expected being an Antman film. Definitively this movie is above many other Marvel films with better grades from critics, doesn't deserve the bad grades."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just finished watching ANTMAN and the way critics lied‚Ä¶this movie is NOWHERE near close to bad these reviewers are very much doing the most. I'll give a detailed review but to put this close to Thor is disrespectful. This is such a strong start to phase 5 wtf??? the way the pacing was down and the tone was very well balanced, I think if you have a love for SCI-FI. you'll love this a lot but yea, please go see the movie it's not just generic action movie slop like the movies in phase 1-3 they've niched down and it's only gonna continue. 

To be honest it has the original ANTMAN charm but unlike Thor when it's serious it's serious. That's my honest take. But it still felt like ANTMAN just a more important movie. And not filler. The best way to describe some aspects of this movie is like watching a marvel, studios, branded Star Wars
Film."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie more than I could possibly expect.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Like any Ant-Man movie, it still had plenty of laughs (maybe too many at times?), and lots of heart - but this time it was more epic with the action and visual effects. I thought it would be a green-screen bonanza, but it came off incredibly natural and realistic. Best Marvel movie to come out since No Way Home."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, Majors is a menace to be taken seriously with real goals and direct conflicts.  Marvel builds and builds, and the film knows it is part of a universe of stories. Rudd is the charm and heart of the film that really knows who he is in this multiverse."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good. Best Disney-Marvel film since Phase 3.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"In a word, this film is ridiculous. But I mean that in the best way possible. It is so much fun and the visuals are amazing, probably the best in the MCU since Doctor Strange (the first one). Started off a little rough (some of the setup felt very forced), but once it got going it roped me in for a very wild ride!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,3.5-4 stars.  It's enjoyable.  Is it the best thing I've ever seen - no.  Am I glad to have spent the time watching it - yes.  I'm afraid we're going to get short intros to a lot of Kang's and never going to feel that dread with a singular entity that Thanos provided.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun popcorn escapism. Nothing groundbreaking, but a very pleasant time at the movies. The humor was landing very well with my audience."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't understand why critics are hammering this film. It was GREAT. I was kind of shocked by the reviews after seeing it. Completely baffled. It's kind of Ant-Man's Ragnarok. So much fun . . . honestly my favorite Ant-Man film of the three.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although the way to solve the final issue is a bit ""simple"", it's a nice begining for the new phase. By the way, those post credit scenes ... Amazing."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Kids loved it. I don't understand why the critics seem all hate it but it was a very good movie that did a good job moving the MCU forward and setting up for the future. Jonathan Majors does great in his role as Kang, it's going to be good to see where this leads."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,CGI was back to what it used to be. Good humor and still maintained a serious story. Good story overall.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's fun to watch. It's a whole new world. We can't expect an Infinity War for every movie. It was a great Ant Man movie. That's the way I see it
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors completely blew this role out the park! Talk about flexing his acting skills. Phenomenal performance by him and the rest of the cast. The world building was also amazing.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was one of the best marvel movies in a while.  Funny, action, opened up a whole new world. Can't wait to see what's next for Kang and all the Avengers."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I‚Äôm a huge marvel fan and I love it. My wife is not a big marvel fan and loved it. See it for yourself don‚Äôt let the reviews scare you away.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't believe the bad reviews. While this movie isn't as funny as the first 2 movies. They still do a great job at making you laugh here and there. The 3rd antman installment definitely takes a different turn. But it's a turn for the better. There is no time wasted as I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. Action packed. Amazing visuals and a fantastic villain. Jonathan Majors steals the show. Best marvel movie since Spider-Man: No Way Home. I will be watching multiple times while it's in theaters
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was good, I was expecting a little more action. But I can appreciate getting the whole story and not being lost!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang was not as intimidating and attractive as I expected. I'm not looking forward to future movies that will be made with such villains.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie from the start to the end.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed very much!!! Rick & Morty humor with  Star Wars vibes.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Im legit super confused at the critics scores. That movie was great! The visuals were miles better than previous MCU movies. The actors were fantastic, and the story was a good time."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-man and the Wasp Quantumania feels like a filler episode in a show. However, not all filler episodes are completely bad. While the compositing and the editing could use some work, the movie shows ant man in a way that we have never seen him. Not only do we see him being beaten by Kang (not a spoiler since it was in the trailer), but we see him interacting with worlds unknown and him attempting to keep his daughter safe at all costs. In my own opinion, this movie is evenly comparable to Shang-Chi, another movie made by marvel.
As for recommending this movie, I can do with confidence that I do. It shows the power of Kang and what he can do to the MCU. But, if you don't find the time to watch it (and are reading reviews instead), I recommend watching the first post credit scene."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"that was a 
fun romp!! lots of laughs"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Some parts were great others felt like it was a star wars movie.  Sets the stages for next movies.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite the critics score, this movie actually won me over in the end - though it does have its flaws. I‚Äôd give it a 7.5/10. If you‚Äôre a big Marvel fan, i think you will definitely enjoy this one."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely had some tonal issues, but man Kang is such a great villain and the CGI was very good, unlike a few different MCU films as of late having some cgi issues."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics are a bunch of idiots. This is a tradition Ant-Man film at it‚Äôs core. This has everything you want in a great movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics don't like movies that are entertaining. This was just that and more.  Finally a marvel movie that doesn't suck. Bring your kids and enjoy an action packed comedy that isn't full of agendas besides to entertain .
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was almost unwatchable. Terrible storyline and pure silliness. I felt like I was watching a kid's cartoon.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loves this one, visually stunning and the story is very compelling, Cassie is a great addition to the ant-family and Kang was just as brilliant and horrific as he needec to be"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,- I was they would have done a different approach on Modok- it looked like the force the image on a shape instead of giving it a normal ratio - other than that I liked it
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,I actually liked this movie don't know why the critics  rated it so low but I stopped caring for the critics for what they did to eternals. Kang and Janet absolutely ATE in this movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,‡∏™‡∏ô‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Å‡πÜ ‡∏ú‡∏°‡∏Å‡πá‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏á ‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏á‡∏ó‡∏≥‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ‡∏î‡∏µ‡πÉ‡∏ô‡∏´‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏¢‡πÜ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏Å‡∏≠‡∏ö ‡πÅ‡∏Ñ‡∏á‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏î‡∏¢‡∏≠‡∏î ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏°‡∏î‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏î‡∏¢‡∏≠‡∏î
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved Quantumania!  Kang is the real deal.   Jonathan Majors delivers a compelling villain.  This movie is going to have a huge impact on the MCU, going forward.   It is easily my favorite of the Ant-Man films and I enjoyed the other two.  And as always, stay for a midcredit and end credit scene.  They are both important!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing start to phase 5 in terms of storyline, and the future of Kang. I can't stand when critics point out bad minute details, and base their entire review over it. The movie did what a movie was supposed to do, and that is entertain me and my entire family throughout. The movie is action packed, and I'm definitely seeing it again. The only thing I could say is that maybe a little less cam shaking within some of the fights, but even saying that is a stretch. Overall it's the best Antman film, and a solid start to phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Melhor filme do homem formiga, Jonathan est√° excepcional no papel de Kang
Humor na dose certa, hist√≥ria boa e agrega demais no futuro da marvel no cinema."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ouch. What happened marvel????  Only good thing was introduction of Kang. Very good Cillian. But Cassie may be the worst character in any marvel movie ever.  Her speach to rally the troops is so bad, it made independence day speach oscar worthy. Wow was she awful."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,wanted to see ant man didn't think he would be a side character in his own movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well I absolutely adore it especially with the grind introduction of (he who remains) aka KANG THE CONQUEROR I've been waiting an entire phase to see him again after Loki season 1 and that patience finally paid off with a fantastic thanos threat villain like him

And i love Modoc I haft to say I wasn't expecting him to be in this movie but holy S___ hes so cool especially that gold mask he has it makes him so scary looking and I love it........but I feel like the mask should have been his actually face because his bald head distracted me a bit when watching........but besides that He is fantastic along side kang and I hope to see more of them from here on out. ü§©"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie had really great moments in the first half, especially with Kang, but completely fell apart in the second half. The last hour was hard to sit through in the theater."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,movie itself is not bad. But I'm not looking forward to future movies.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics must not of understood the movie. An absolute great entry to the Marvel Universe!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pel√≠cula introduce a Kang El Conquistador y su firme prop√≥sito de formar su Dinast√≠a. Ant-Man y familia se enfrentan a uno de los pr√≥ximos gran villanos del UCM. Marvel puede darnos mejores y m√°s interesantes sopresas en sus historias, esperemos mejoren sus guiones en futuras entregas."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good Movie. Critics don't know what regular people like to watch.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,If they just made a movie that was Johnathan Majors monologuing for 2 hours as Kang I'd still give this five stars.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie! Enjoyed the exploration of the quantum realm, introduction of new/old characters. Welcome to the mcu Kang!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty solid start to Phase 5 and what‚Äôs to come for the next MCU event. And yet, another MCU movie being carried out by the main villain. Jonathan Majors Kang the Conqueror is not to be taken as a joke."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie has a lot going on, second half is when it really comes to life. A solid entry for the beginning of the next phase."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of fun. Kang is great and terrifying! Definitely recommend. Reviewers have no idea what they're talking about!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was enjoyable for the most part, but it felt like a generic Marvel movie. Lots of issues with CGI in the beginning and plot was jumping all over the place. But Kang was fantastic. Excited to see where this leads with him in the future."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun family story and a great look into MCU's developing Kang dynasty
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great! A lot of fun! I loved the build up to the introduction of Kang really was effective in making him menacing and Jonathan Majors was a great choice to take on the many versions of Kang and the one in this movie. Liked the exploration of the Quantum realm and all the stuff inside. Would watch again üëåüèæ
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great..
A lot of eye candy and humor.."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of action funny nd its marvel duh
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,it was good cant wait to see more
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it!! The story was darker and more serious but the characters and designs were wacky and fun keeping the humor in the series. Go in for a fun time, and a fun time you will have!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,The most disappointing MCU film I have ever seen. I was barely excited for the film too.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant Man Quantamania was a decent movie. (better than Thor 4) 
The visuals were out of this world, they were Ant-tastic. The acting was amazing, Jonathan Majors executed his role as Kang perfectly. CGI overall was good ( some parts were questionable)
Despite looking weird, M.O.D.O.K was AWESOME. 
However, the movie had little to none character development. 
The plot was a mess. It feels like they spent all their budget on the CGI/VFX and underpaid the script/plot writers. 
So unfortunately, it remains to be another Phase 4 level movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Very in line with the previous Antman movies but funny and enjoyable after all
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The ""movie critics"" have no idea what they're talking about regarding this movie.  It was great.  Everything I expected it to be and it's setting up The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars  perfectly."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is mcu meets Dune and Star Trek. Very bold and dark sci-fi concepts. Jonathan Majors as Kang is now probably the best MCU villain on screen. It's basically a 2 hr phase 5 tease that'll leave you wanting more. Some parts get messy during action sequences but wraps up very nicely at the end.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The creativity of a comic mixed with amazing actors, a lot of humor, and storybuilding for the next 10 years. Was a blast."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Has the heart (fun, light) of the Ant-Man movies with the greater MCU story arc weaved throughout. Enjoyed it a lot."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Exciting - helps tie this phase together!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Marvel movies. I want them all to be this good.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"weird and strange, hopefully sets up the next phase of Marvel!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok. Definitely lacked a lot of what made the first 2 so much fun. 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"People may say it doesn't have the spark past movies have had, but it does, in a multiversal type of way. Has the perfect amount of humor. Jonathan Majors is fantastic in this film, along with everyone else in the cast. Favorite villain of the MCU by far."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Ignore the critics- this is a solid installment to the MCU. The acting is great and Jonathan Majors is a remarkable King. My only complaint is the runtime- I honestly would've liked another half hour to hash out some finer details. Otherwise I was a happy camper!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just watched and really enjoyed. Part humor, part serious, and part a doorway to the next phase,  it kept me intrigued. Rudd and Lily were great. Douglas and Phifer were solid as ever. I love where this is going. The critics are harsh, but it's one of the better recent Marvel movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some EPIC setpieces in this one. Great acting all around, ESPECIALLY by Jonathan Majors. Without spoiling, I'll say that the opening scene going down into the Quantum Realm, and the ""many Ant Mans"" scene as teased in the trailer, along with everything else Kang-related, is simply a wonder to behold. But it's always anchored in Scott Lang's love for his daughter, which as a divorced-and-later-remarried father, has always hit me like a massive gut punch. Very very very very excited for the future of Kang in the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great way to kick off phase 5.  Kang is going to be oodles of fun to watch for years to come.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Main takeaway: where is Luis??
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"In this third outing of the Ant-Man franchise and beginning chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's fifth phase, Quantumania is a mania in of itself: a mania of action and a mania of confusion. The world-building of the Quantum Realm is one to applaud as it has been visually vague since the first Ant-Man film, but to actually go more in-depth and explore its city-like structures and its inhabitants is actually entertaining to see. However, the pacing does feel weird at times as the first act moves pretty quick to the point where there is not a whole lot of chemistry and characterization between the main characters once they enter the Quantum Realm. The humor does not land as sharp and goofy as previous Marvel installments because it focuses too much on ""raising the stakes,"" which is not a bad thing, but it fails to reinvigorate the charm in the adventures that were once witnessed. Certain rules established in previous films involving the Quantum Realm also have some plot holes and continuity issues if you pay close enough attention. I will not spoil that, but I will say that it is not very cohesive at some parts. Johnathan Majors, however, is the saving grace of this film as he continues to prove himself to be a strong and vigilante actor in in the role of Kang, the next MCU big bad. All in all, this is the start of Phase 5, and one can only hope that Marvel can and will learn from the mistakes of the previous phase and bring back the charm and thrill of the Marvel cinematic experience we once had in the Infinity Saga. I give this film a 5.7 out of 10, or a 57%."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It needed a few more script passes, and less cast members. The vfx was incredible in parts and horrendous in others."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good development of Cassie
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,This was probably the best of the three antman films. It wasn‚Äôt amazing but I would not put it anywhere near Thor 4 or Eternals. Solid continuation of where the MCU is headed. 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fun. My favorite Ant-Man yet.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Painful dialogue. No character development. Messy CGI. Sooooo much exposition and flashbacks. Such a letdown after the buildup of the villain in previous installments. It's hard to see Marvel fall so far from where it once was.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, Kang was amazing , couple of scenes dragged on for me but overall I liked it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Really liked the movie and Kang as a character.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The two hours actually goes quickly.  The movie has great pacing. The only critique I'll agree with is that there is so many things competing it doesn't have emotional impact of a Wakanda Forever or Shang Chi. However, it is far superior to Thor Love and Thunder and a good film overall. But critics today are just going to slam anything from Marvel that isn't at an A+ level. That's where we are!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,√â um bom filme como todos os filmes do homem formiga
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just watched the movie and the movie is very good. It lacks emotional ending tho (spoiler), you dont feel the empathy towards MODOK when he attacks the Kang. Kang the Conqueror's goal remains mystery, is he a good guy that wants to fight other bad Kang variants? Is he younger version of He Who Remains in the Loki series? Because his goal and relationship with other Kang variants looks similar. (If you consider pruning the timelines as killing alternate universes).  It all remains mystery. But I definitely recommend the watching the movie, it is fast paced, you don't feel like 2 hours passed when you watched the movie. Great opening to the Phase 5"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"pretty fun! not perfect, but fun, and a fun new chapter for ant-man. loved hank & janet on this one"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,A bit boring overall but good introduction of kang. 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics. Great story, Good fights good ending!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"lots of fun, excellent acting, a lot happens in what feels like a short span of time. A good time with the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Way better than the critics score!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't understand the negative reviews. Movie stood up on its own legs. Loved it, best of all Ant-Man movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's good not great, pacing maybe rush but still worth to watch."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is entertaining and ambitious. Johnathan Majors Kang is a complex villain that is a worthy successor to Thanos. Scott, Hope, Cassie, Hank and Janet are all vital to the story and their family dynamic is one of the best parts of the movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors with a tour de force performance! Kang is the baddie weve been waiting for since Thanos! Everyone clapped at moments between fight sequences with Ant Man. The MCU is  in good hands with this baddie!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"That was pretty good. I definitely liked it a lot lot better than MoM.

The scale of the movie was too big though. I somewhat appreciated the small scale stories of previous Antman movies.

All in all, the story worked for me. Kang was very terrifying when he meets Scott for the first time, and Majors' dialogue delivery was great in that scene. But Kang did seem a bit underpowered, but that's understandable as he was stuck in Quantum Realm.

Only plot point I wasn't a fan of was the ant army, and them creating a super colony over their ""thousands"" of years in QR. Seemed like an easy way to win the big battle.

Overall, loved it more than I thought I would because of the Rotten Tomatoes score. It's a good entry, and good introduction to the entity that is Kangs."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's pretty good but its very predictable and MODOK throws me off
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Love all the Ant Man Movies
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the critics. The movie is so good
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie I thought I was a great kick off to phase 5 I don't know why the tomato score is so low definitely a must see and I like the way they ended it the action in it was amazing and I loved Cassie lang and the rest of the gang!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are just unnecessary at this point. What wasn‚Äôt to like? Was it perfect? Of course not. But maybe what we need is to just wait for the actual audience vote because these people are like meteorologists and can‚Äôt predict sh*t. 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't trust the critic reviews. Everything they rate high is actually a horrible movie. Everything they rate low is really good. Guess this movie didn't have enough inclusiveness or Lgbqt  in it so it gets low score. Good movie way better than any of the recent marvel movies/shows.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is one of the worst things marvel has ever produced. The effects looked like I drew them, there's no story, and this Jon Majors everyone loves was boring as three day old toast.  Honestly don't know how Feige signed off on any of this?"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has gotten so much hate for no reason. It was a great mixture of action, fun and intenseness. Kang scenes were so fantastic. I can't wait to see more of him!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good, best MCU release since MOM, not sure what the critics have up their bum"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,A messy 1st nearly ruins the fun ride but thankfully M.O.D.O.K. saves the day. Quantumania is too big for an Ant-Man film but there's still enough fun to be had.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Phenomenal! The Movie is a Literal Gift That Keeps on Giving. Do With That What You Will. I give it a 10/10 üé¨üôèüèæ‚ú®üíØ I was thoroughly impressed.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,SO THATS WHY THEY CALL IT ANT MAN AND THE WASP QUANTAMANIA CRAZYYYYY
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great in my opinion. Other have theirs. Just can't go into every MCU film expecting it to be Endgame quality.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"really enjoyed this flick, did what it needed to do and kept me entertained"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Top tier acting AND action! Paul Rudd brought humor & heart, which I expected, but with more edge ü§åüèΩ!  

Michael Douglas brought much more warmth this go round, which makes sense‚Äîwe get a softer side of ""Hank"" now that ""Janet"" is back.

I especially enjoyed the ways flawed but formidably powerful women drove the storyline, without the stench of ""pandering."" Real talk, Evangeline Lily, Katy O'brian, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Kathryn Newton kicked a WHOLE lotta a** in this film üí™üèΩ! 

That said, please know that JONATHAN MAJORS as ""Kang"" is worth the price of admission!!! He is an absolute FORCE - dude ATE  this role and left NO crumbs!!! üëèüèΩüôåüèΩüî•"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Really enjoyed it not sure where the hate is coming from. Though it doesn't have any of those small everything is big moments here which is missed. Power level is definitely off between kang and the ant man family but if you aren't a hard core fan or know much about kang it won't be a big problem for you.  Really fun movie with some good post credit scenes finally that tease what's to come. Modak was awful and I mean terrible worst part of the whole movie hated every time he was on screen. Basically spy kids for marvel if yk yk and you will. Some characters get more to do than others but overall I'd say it's a 7/10 or 3 star out of 5 but. I highly recommend it.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,bad start to phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-Man was a solid Marvel movies. MCU fans will appreciate the humor and action. Not an all-time great movie but Johnathan Majors shines.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not bad. nothing to complain about. Definitely the connection to the Kang Dynasty movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie with awesome visual effect but a little under expected
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"MCU finally remembered they have a big bad  to set up, it sucks that Scott's personal story had to take a back seat though. Makes his character progression seem a big stagnant. They cut back on the cringy humor too but the ""jokes"" they did leave in stick out like a sore thumb. Some characters were a bit lacking but Majors manages to carry the weight and give a crazy performance. The entire final battle had me on the edge of my seat and I'm eager to see where  this leads next."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I highly recommend watching the Loki series on Disney+ before watching this movie mostly for some background on who Kang is and his motivations. It will also give you a better understanding of the mid and post credit scenes. That being said, this movie definitely satisfied my expectations. The best Antman movie so far. Visually it was stunning with a plethora of cool and unique creatures and characters. The cast was excellent with great acting especially Jonathan Majors as Kang. Don‚Äôt let the critics score fool you into not seeing this. If you‚Äôre a fan of the MCU you‚Äôll love this movie. "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"woah, what comes next!?"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The pacing at the start of the movie was a bit off but once you got half way through the first act it got a lot better and the movie truly throws you into the action. The movie knew exactly when to throw jokes out and when to take it seriously. In my opinion this movie was a great way to end the antman trilogy
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantmania - A pretty solid entrance into Phase 5 of the MCU with a fantastic performance from Jonathan Majors as the powerful Kang the Conqueror.  The only flaws in this movie are the god-awful CGI and the downright useless Modok. Overall, I think it was a pretty good Marvel movie, not great but not awful."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I think the movie falls flat!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the film and if you watched Loki it really tied in the last episode of Loki to this film it‚Äôs a must see plenty of action and fight scenes were great I love the ant man series Paul Rudd is a great fit to the franchise
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It didnt actually add to the MCU, just a filler movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well, well worth the watch. Critics don't know a single thing they're talking about. This is the best of the Ant-Man franchise and an incredible way to kick off Phase 5 and get audiences ready for what's to come. Stakes remain high throughout, they flesh out the quantum realm with Star Wars-level atmosphere, and the pacing of this movie had my wife and I on the edge of our seats the entire movie. When the stakes finally let you breathe, my wife and I realized how tightly we were gripping our hands. So fun. Go see it!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun Marvel movie. Probably the best of the Ant-man series!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,A lot of the characters looked copied straight out of Star Wars. Def not the best Marcel film. The best thing about the movie was Paul Rudd
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Particularmente, t√¥ querendo ir pro cinema pra ver um filme bom e me empolgar em ao menos 30 minutos de filme, mas ao inv√©s disso o que esse filme entrega √© uma lenga lenga desajustada, com uma atua√ß√£o em espec√≠fico √≥tima (Jonathan Majors) e outra p√©ssima (Kathryn Newton) 
No mais, espero que o pr√≥ximo projeto da Marvel Studios seja um filme empolgante e n√£o um amontoado sem vida e previs√≠vel com p√≥s-cr√©ditos bons que s√≥ deixam um grande ""se preparem pra"", ""vem a√≠"", etc."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really good and enjoyable me and my girlfriend watched it Thursday afternoon and Kang was done extremely well.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Do not let the score keep you from seeing this movie. Yes, it's different than other Antman movies, but it needs to be. The SFX were outstanding. We get to see another side of Scott Lang that we've never seen before. The time flew by and before I knew it the movie was over. I don't want to post spoilers but the fight between Scott and Kang proved Scott's strength, courage, and loyalty. 

You will have fun!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Hey Feige, it's never too late to not be a dick, lol. The Marvel formula ruins the movies for Marvel comic book readers. Stop making everything for goofy bros. Try finding real writers."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was overall great I loved it from start to finish it really felt like a Paul Rudd movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best of the last 4 Marvel movies in my opinion. The comedy was mixed in well with the action. Quantumania is just a really fun, exciting and entertaining movie. 8/10"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Dont pay any attention to the movie critics. Movie was great!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"My only real issues are with the third act. Kang is excellent, and the Quantum Realm is a whole lot of fun. Definitely recommend this one"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"What should've been a massive endeavor into the 5th phase of the MCU ends up just being a fun, but ultimately messy and convoluted entry that has one of the worst third acts in any MCU film. Paul Rudd is fun and Jonathan Majors steals the show, but I left the theater wanting more from Kathrin Newton's Cassie Lang and Michael Douglass's Hank Pim, as I felt that had been underwritten."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it, I don't know why it's rated pretty low by critics but also I kinda don't care. This movie is a fun watch and the Quantum Realm looks beautiful."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"My review of ant-man and the wasp quantumania 
It was pretty damn good for the start of phase 5 I love the storyline the CGI was amazing Kang was a beasts he wasn't playing no games and modok wasn't that bad he really look like the modok from the comics I give it 10 out of 10"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's fine, very good introduction to Kang, he's actually a very scary and solid villain, im very excited to see how their going to defeat him, I wouldn't watch it again tho, Michelle and Jonathan carried the film"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great for what it is! This is what I needed from a movie starting off a phase. This move makes me excited about what's to come!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,If you're an MCU fan this movie delivers everything it promised. It's still funny but of course much more serious than the past Ant-Man films. The CGI is good. Kang is the perfect villain.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I Absolutely Loved The Movie Especially In D-Box & 3D!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,was to  long of movie  and really kidd like but have nothing else  it good to watch
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'll start with the good: It was fun and beautiful and had a decent story.  And Majors is a majorly awesome Kant!!
I'll sandwich the bad: Some of the effects, color, sound, and dialogue fell flat. 
Bottom bun mixed: MODOK! I love MODOK or at least the idea of him and hilarity of him so it was awesome he was in the movie, but the presentation of his face was not good."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed every minute!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the movie! Great plot!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Breathtaking visuals and effects. Amazing start to the phase. Jonathan Majors was great!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Paul Rudd is great, super charismatic and charming. Storyline is cool and all but it all could have been avoided if Janet shared her feelings. Action is cool, its the quantum realm, so a bunch of CGI. Its got a lot of good comedy sequences that are unforced."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I truly am shocked by the low critics score!  Is it the best of the MCU?  No...is it in the top 50%?  At a minimum!  Great time!  Love the huge sci Fi swing!  Come on critics... We just can't let success ride for too long before we feel insecure and have to start knocking it down!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Had a lot of laughs like you'd expect from an Ant-Man movie. Kang is a great villain and I'm excited to see where that goes.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie Kangüî•
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is just the beginning!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with the actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstory changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting into more detail with these characters, and concepts."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best marvel Movies in my opinion! A story about a fathers love and how far he will go to protect the ones he loves!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang is in the comic Pantheon and now the MCU pantheon of villains. I would rewatch for him every time.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"After watching it for 2nd time, Ant Man & The Wasp Quantumania is an entertaining movie to eatch in family delivering some good special effects, humor and action."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"movie was good, definitely worth seeing in the theaters. Very different, good story, and a great look into the future of Marvel"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what people are expecting,  but this is A) the best ant-man movie (not setting the bar high, admittedly) and B) A much stronger start than phase 4.
Kang is a menace.  
There have been complaints about the first act.  It's fine, it's a setup, it works, no worries.  Once Kang gets in, the movie is instantly better.
One downside is I didn't care about a single person in the Rebellion.  They were just plot tools.
This was far better than almost every movie from phase 4, minus SpiderMan, for the simple reason we already know where this is going.  There are other gripes, but it would be spoilers to mention it.
Don't listen to the critics.  If you felt fired up about this movie, you'll probably like it."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just an awful, boring mess of a movie with a weak villain. And just look at the Disney bots positive review bombing this. What a joke."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great SciFi movie, with great visuals and action, that kicks off phase 5 in a great way and introduces Kang to the MCU perfectly."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fantastic watch that kept me entertained from the opening credits until the last post-credit scene (which was extremely promising). The one thing I wish was better‚Ä¶ It felt like they tried to get to the end of the story too quickly which in turn took away from character development. ALL the characters needed more screen time, which could have easily been solved by making the movie a little longer."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don‚Äôt listen to the critics, this is a great movie, but it‚Äôs not for the casual fan. Solid movie for the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"es muy buena, el humor de Paul Rudd es incre√≠ble y se siente tan fresco, es una pel√≠cula entretenida y divertida, y del villano es una buena adaptaci√≥n al personaje de Kang, definitivamente un buen inicio a la fase 5"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is great introduction to phase 5 . Kang is very well done, with outstanding fighting scenes, with great creativity with the Quantum creatures and people."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had a blast with the movie! It's not the best plot wise and I wish we got to spend more time with Jonathan Majors Kang, but you forget all that when you get immersed in the movie. Great to see an Ant-man film on a bigger scale. Highly recommend it! Have fun watching it!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The was great y'all must watch it
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Some cgi was poor. Didn‚Äôt like the plot of same old good guy beats bad with no consequences formula.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Est√° pel√≠cula se siente fresca y entretenida, especial para los m√°s peque√±os de la casa. Muy recomendada."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are trying to bury this movie (can you guess why?) But it's actually a good and refreshing addition to the Ant-Man franchise. Takes a step back from the issues of phase 4 in my opinion, and focuses on a fun story. Theres alot of humor but for Ant-Man i expect that.. Majors absolutely kills it as Kang. ignore the critics, go see this one!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Modok‚Äôs visuals were  the only hiccup.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some characters get sidelined while others shine, and you certainly feel like the story jumps around a bit too quickly, but for the most part this movie was whacky, weird fun. It tends to make you rely on your ‚ÄúAnt-Man‚Äù cinema knowledge, so that may be a drawback or a payoff, depending who you ask. But entertained for sure!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-Man and the wasp Quantumania was a good and funny movie. I had a blast watching it. This is for the critics üñï.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dare I say the best Antman? Yes!!
First, like previous movies, Antman has a lot of heart with funny moments. It also brings science to a whole new level, emphasizing the multiverse. Everything Marvel has been hand holding you through phase 4 finally pays off with this movie.
We are introduced to Kang (finally) in the cinematic universe. A man of intrigue, mystery, and underlying darkness, you are slowly revealed as to what kind of man he is. A man who wants to destroy more than what Thanos could ever dream of. 
I loved all the characters and enjoy knowing the backstory of what went on in the Quantum Realm when Janet was stuck for 30 years. 
I hope everyone sees the movie and comes to the realization that this is the start of an epic new adventure for the Marvel universe."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man Wasp Quantumania starts phase 5 with impact, entertainment and beauty. Kang is synonymous with power and the extension of power. Congratulations MarvelStudios, you delivered what you promised."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was not just a great entry in the MCU, but a great sci-fi movie in its own right, full of wondrous images, thrills and creativity. Well paced for its length, sensibly plotted and well acted."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"People say the movies pace was off, the cg was terrible and that Kang the villain was lackluster. To me I genuinely see none of those points, the cg looked fine, its a fake universe of course its not real but it looked more than acceptable to me (unless you work on cg projects it should look more than acceptable to the average moviegoer) Pacing was fine too, things were laid out, things moved longhand things were explained and expanded on. And the villain Kang was the cherry on top, Majors plays an intimidating and terrifying role showing the bad side of this famous marvel villain legend. 8/10 for me personally :)"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Is it good? Yes. Is it anything more than that? No. Ant-Man 3 wants to be a high stakes movie but fails to deliver on it. Great performances all around and some of the MCU's better cgi uses in the last few years. There's a lot going on in this 2 hour adventure and probably too big for an Ant size hero‚Ä¶.see what I did there lol. Paul Rudd is still a joy to watch as Scott but  overall there is absolutely no reason to have an Ant-Man 4 movie after this one. Trilogy completed and wrapped.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was everything I expected it to be. The acting was great, and the visual effects are stellar. Perfect mix of comedy, action, and suspense. Jonathan Majors was amazing as Kang and I can't wait to see more. The best Marvel movie in the last couple of years right next to Spider-Man: No Way Home."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is great! Funny as an Ant-man movie should be, and with the great performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una gran pel√≠cula, m√°s seria que las anteriores"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A good appetizer. Sadly, it's the same menu from Phase 4."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Un guion lastrado sin sentido que no sabe como aterrizar.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie to open phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was alright the main cast were written fine the main problem is how marvel wasted 2 perfect villians. MODOK was just a wasted and very poor written villian who gets defeated way to easily and kang is just a vader on steroids 2.0 who forgets about his powers at the end of the movie and has a really dumb death. Kang isn't an ant man villian to begin with the plot armor just ruined it. Don't get me wrong I still loved the main cast and the cgi was amazing but they ruin 2 perfectly written villians again
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,This a great introduction to Jonathan Majors Kang. At times the story can full a bit all over the place but great addition to the Ant-Man series. My only issue is WHERE IS LUIS!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was excellent! I highly recommend. Not sure why the movie critics gave it a 50, that's crazy. The movie was great."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,This is a lot. High highs low lows. Hardest MCU movie to rate.. 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,it's a great start to phase 5.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Sci fi Marvel Adventure.  opens phase 5 with a giant epic adventure thru the quantum realm. loved it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what the ""reviewers"" are talking about. It's funny, action-packed, probably Marvel's weirdest movie yet, and Jonathon Majors' Kang is incredible. I already want to go again."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muito bom, a cr√≠tica vacilou muito com esse filme igual fizeram com Eternos"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is amazing and funny. Johnathon Major as Kang is absolutely terrify, The Ant family is funny and lovely. M.O.D.O.K is goofy and silly but he has some of his own cool moments. The CGI is better than some of the phase 4 project Overall the movie is fantastic and an absolute must see."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I am scratching my head as to why anyone would have issue with this film. In my humble opinion people stopped realizing that these installments in the larger MCU aren't going to all be endgame. I loved every bit of this film. Paul Rudd is fantastic. It's silly. It's sweet. It's terrifying. It has heart. All in a beautiful elseworld of its own wonder. Great plot. Great story. Great writing. Great acting. I could not stop watching. Anyone that likes Star Wars or Star Trek will love how this movie is put together. 5 out of 5. Let's all remember to have fun.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was interesting... but so many scenes that were like - just why?
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel Phase 5 starting out with Ant Man 3 was a good thing. Janet, Hank and Cassie are the focal point in this movie. While Scott and Hope take a small back seat.

Johnathan Majors makes this movie, seeing him as Kang and what he can do and what he will do in the Multiverse is scary, because there are so many variants of this character we don't know which one we are getting.

In Loki Season 1 it was established that there will be repercussions of whats to come and what will and could happen.

Now MODOK was interesting and different, the character of MODOK does get closure since it is Darren from the first Ant-Man movie.

The Quantum Realm is something that has never been seen before in full scale in the MCU and in this we get it front and center. The CGI is the best since THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER.

There are comedic moments in this but nothing to hinder the fact that this is a solid fun entry for PHASE 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun super hero movie
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Michelle Pfeiffer is at the top of her game with no sign of slowing down. The only question is whether or not she right scripts come her way.

Paul Rudd and Johnanthan Majors also give stellar performances, but that's all this film amounts to. It's a 3D, Green Screen cashgrab that failed to deliver on its promise- something we haven't seen before. 

Phase 5 seems to be a reminder that the strongest content Marvel put out in Phase 4 was its series. 

At the end of the day,  this was a 20 dollar, between season, Loki spinoff. Wait for it on Disney+"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,To me it was a spectacular and glorious IMAX experience. Overall it's very entertaining  and enjoyable.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good a little bit lacking but still good and worth the watch
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good movie overall. A good start to phase 5.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Ant-man yet. Good story. Great action at the end.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Out of all the Ant-Man movies this is definitely the best out of the three!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just left it, and I give this movie a 10/10.  And honestly?  We need to get this director to do a Star Wars movie.  This was a better Star Wars movie than Rise of Skywalker ü•¥ü•¥   It had just enough cheesy comedy and more than enough action.  Didnt check my watch once.  Also, Majors as Kang?  Maaan I am ready.  This phase is about to be crazy."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wooww amazingg
i waiting for next film"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel Sci-fi- uh, yes, please. May I have some more? I imagine there will be some who don‚Äôt vibe with it but I did. Will need to watch again to absorb more. Right amount of funny and major stakes in play. Kang The Conqueror is amazing. Like legit scary villain."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was boring. The young actress that played Cassie was a really good actress tho
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't let the critics fool you, movie is dope... Not perfect, but a great set up for the upcoming phase"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great, dont be swayed by the critics, i give it an 8/10 Jonathan Majors was majestic cant wait to see whats next."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great. Especially with it being an Ant-Man movie. I feel that the movie did what it was suppose to do and a great start to phase 5. Jonathan Majors was fantastic as Kang and he makes it very exciting for the future of the MCU. Paul Rudd was awesome as well with balancing the comedic relief while being in scene with a serious Kang. Overall, I enjoyed this movie more than all the phase 4 movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good the first half had some wonky visuals but it's what I expected
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gostei bastante, tem emo√ß√£o e a√ß√£o, os efeitos visuais s√£o √≥timos, alguns pontos incomodam mas os pontos positivos os superam"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In terms of story, this film seems rushed in the first half. The many new characters that are present are even sidelined without deepening the character due to the threats that are present non-stop. This makes a lack of sympathy for these Quantum Realm native characters."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,GREAT START TO PHASE 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The main characters felt more like supporting characters, but I wouldn't take that as a negative. This film legitimately kick starts the next big bad in the MCU. Great flick."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A wacky movie with a lot of crazy ideas, an amazing looking world filled with creative creatures and concepts (that does feel like Star Wars at times), great action and character moments.
Hold back a bit by a few dialogue choices, and a somewhat abrupt ending, but a great start to what's to come for Phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,the 2nd Worst MCU movie behind Thor: Love and Thunder. the Mcu is Dead. Reboot it!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are stupid, don't listen to them. Movie was full of action and Kangs a gangsta."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best MCU movie on a long time
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie.. explained well good storyline
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Holy crap this movie was absolutely nuts and insane, Ignore the critics they are dumb. Definitely action packed. Jonathan Majors was brilliant and terrifying as Kang, Marvel did amazing by casting Majors,Loved the back story between Janet‚Äôs time in the quantum realm and her history with Kang. Definitely stay for the end credits both are important. Pay attention to what Kang says, he foreshadows a little of what‚Äôs to come in the future. The message of the film was so good, there is always another battle to be fought, and one can never truly rest on one‚Äôs laurels. If you Thanos wiping out half of all life, well wait until you meet Kang, who isn‚Äôt just a time traveling warlord. He threatens not just ‚Äúour‚Äù reality, but every other one out there."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This really sets the stage for what's to come in the Multiverse Saga.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While perhaps not the best example of an ""Ant-Man"" film, Quantumania solidifies a future for the MCU at a time when so many fans are feeling aimless, focusing on broad world building over narrative storytelling. Jonathan Majors performance deserves praise and I for one am quite excited to see the future of the Conqueror."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not the best but great story line
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Marvel never disappoints good action and special effects 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the best, most fun movie in a while from the MCU - go see it!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely recommend if you‚Äôve watched the earlier shows and movies with kang and ant man
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Good job the the VFX artists for putting in the hours. Unfortunately the script writers churned out a Nickelodeon B movie with no plot
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good film overall, some down moments here and there"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"a few things:
1. what a terrible start to phase 5
2. that script. woof.
3. they nerfed kang and even THEN he felt like he didn't fit this movie at all. 
4. how the mighty have fallen, kevin feige.
5. that mid credit scene felt like an snl skit
6. im so disappointed
7. post credit scene was the best part
8. ragnarok if it was boring"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst movie of Marvel
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was good for the most part, but it failed to pick up."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I feel like this movie gets the same treatment as Ironman 2 because the entire reason for this to exist is to make Kang seem like a threat. I liked JMs performance throughout the movie except for that weird mid credit cosplay type scene. All the actors were good in their roles it's just the story was mediocre.
Movie could have used a more stable story as did loki series and still introduced kang in a menacing way."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,looking forward to more kang
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun summer blockbuster in February. There are some overly quirky parts, but it establishes Jonathan Majors as a heck of an antagonist for the rest of this saga. If Phase 5 is the equivalent of Phase 2, this is already a better start than Dark World or Iron Man 3. GOTG can take the Winter Soldier role."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super fun movie, raises the stakes of the ant man franchise. Gives you a glimpse of what's to come for the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The best marvel movie yet since nowayhome!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything is good till the final battel comes it's was like What the heck Ant-Man in his big Kang face turned like what the hell this thing is and .......
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie with great characters
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantamania was awesome!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Really awesome marvel movie finally!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pros: Paul Rudd , Modok, CGI, funny, end credit scenes

Cons:
Music was generic
Repetitive
Generic movie tropes
Kang was a big baby like Kylo Ren (also cool like Kylo Ren, just needed a better director)
Unlikeable main cast (except for Rudd ‚ù§Ô∏è)
Logic made no sense (fast and furious makes more sense)
Another hidden world!!!!?!?!!?!
Bad dialogue 
Plot made no sense
Hyped up villian just for an unsatisfying ending
Inconsistent powers 
Horrible social commentary
No consequences
No threat
No drama
No meaning
No emotion
Not invested

Conclusion: Now, marvel makes trailers, not movies. If we could turn back time, to the good old days üòî"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Soo good. It's a must see!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was good but I wish there was more action and that the final fight scene would of had more ant man versus kang , and that we would actually see more of Kangs powers . But overall good movie I would recommend it to go see"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"i went in thinking i didn't have much interest in this movie.  Boy, was i wrong!  I truly enjoyed the story, humor, and special effects.  I have no idea what the heck movie the critics watch to score a 48.... that's just insane!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Introduction to phase 5. Could dive deeper into Scott and Cassies relationship more but overall solid film. Johnathon Majors is absolutely menacing as Kang every second on the screen. 2 post credit scenes are very exciting.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una pel√≠cula con los chistes necesarios, sin exagerar como Thor: Love and Thunder..."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Foolish storyline....but kang was very good......
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved loved loved it!!! Ooooh very Good, and Kang was amazing!!!! Can't wait for the rest of phase 5!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good film. It was funny and fun. Though I feel it lacked the realness it deserved. Huge implications to the MCU.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A thrilling adventure that takes us back to marvel's phase 2/3, with a movie that despite it's small scale has big implications for the future of Marvel. A lighthearted story, with a sense of danger elevated by the outstanding performance of Johnathan Majors as Kang. Thanos has met his match, and he is Kang The Conqueror!! Future looking more than bright, amazing and fun movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant Man 3 is a boring, dull movie with deplorable dialogues, in short the movie is bad from the beginning until the last minute, nothing is taken away from this movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was nice not having to deal with all the ""wokeness"" in more recent outings.  Looks like the MCU might have gotten on track again.  Well done!  Good seeing MODOfK and Bill Murray.  Excellent story, looking forward to Loki Season 2 also!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a sci-fi epic! It is very different to the other Ant-Man movies but that is the right thing to do. And it still has the heart of this franchise, family is so strong in this. Paul Rudd is still as loveable and funny as ever. The visuals are amazing, the Quantum Realm is a stunning place. Kang the Conqueror is an insane villain portrayed with so much range by Jonathan Majors. The stakes are clearly high when he is around. Phase 5 is off to an awesome start, this is the best Ant-Man movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,the worst thing that marvel has released.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun, crazy and trippy way to start off Phase 5 of the MCU. It's the biggest Ant-Man movie yet but still feels grounded with the family dynamic between all main characters. With the introduction of Kang we get a taste of what we are to expect going forward and it's safe to say that all of our Marvel heroes will have their hands full. Loved it and would highly recommend."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Watched February 16, 2023 - The serious and dramatic tones didn't work well in this threequel. Phase 5 is off to a bar start..."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic film, loved ant man,  i didnt like ant man and the wasp but this film is way better than both, especially if you love sci fi, highly recommend."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Action pack adventure and kang is badass love the movie the cast is so goodüòä ant-man is the best
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buen inicio a la fase 5 del MCU lo √∫nico desagradable fue en doblaje de Cassie ü§¢ la pel√≠cula tiene m√°s cosas positivas que negativas üëç
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not sure why the rotten tomatoes score is so low..this was action packed and very enjoyable
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was a good time kang was phenomenal and the visual effects were solid the setup was kind-of terrible but after that it just fun the laughs were great and you will never look at holes the same way
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movies really shows what a spectacular next phase we have coming! In some ways the action is bigger then endgame in my opinion and more all over! To do what there doing going forward they will need two! Great movie! Fun and visually stunning!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not a bad movie, Rotten Tomato‚Äôs score was wrong it should be higher, never the less the move does have problems. Not going to spoil anything but the seriousness could have been around more. Overall was super happy and satisfied"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Cassie was overly annoying this movie Kang was great though
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,This whole phase as kinda sucked
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Not sure what the critics were watching because this movie was great! I was very excited for this movie but walked in with low expectations after the negative reviews. This movie was everything I was hoping for and makes me excited for the rest of Phase 5. Kang was awesome. Paul Rudd was great as usual and the visual effects were very cool.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cgi ruim, piadas mal enfaixadas, momentos vergonha alheia, atores atuando no autom√°tico, sem carisma, sem gra√ßa, sem peso. Kang perdeu pra formigas, e perdeu no soco pro homem formiga. Cara, que filme horroroso. 

Daria 0 estrelas, mas a cena p√≥s cr√©dito foi legal."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,When I find it interesting about it. They went to a multiple dimension. How he kept hearing noises. It was the ant colony what he heard. It was very funny.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Top tier acting AND action! Jonathan Majors as Kangaroo is a FORCE!!!!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A absolute necessity in the multiverse sage as always I trust Kevin feige he knows what he's doing and for the movie it starts out the gate running it's more multiverse then adding to ant man which is okay ant man will get more stories to tell his rn this first step into phase five is a promising start don't listen to the officials that gave this rotten then don't know a good movie of it bite them in the A.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A perfunctory family drama that lacks any real stakes, or nuance and complexity for the antagonist. Kang feels underwhelming, like yet another in a long line of MCU villains that shout empty threats without doing any real damage to the heroes. You can safely skip this largely standalone outing."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it‚Äôs was a funny and action packed
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang was as terrifying and intimidating as I hoped he would be! His presence on screen is insane and I can‚Äôt wait to see more of him, the Conqueror and other variants. Cassie was a surprise and I really enjoyed her here. Hope didn‚Äôt have much to do really but what she did get was good. Janet got more of a spotlight this time which I really liked. Her character was interesting and the backstory with her and her times before in the Quantum realm were fantastic. Hank got a great hero moment that I appreciated as he was the original Ant Man after all! Scott was the same as usual, Paul Rudd is always great as Scott. The stuff in the Quantum realm was insane and wonderful to watch. Some of the jokes were a bit whatever but not so much it took away from the movie. All in all, definitely the best Ant Man movie to date, and I‚Äôve enjoyed all of them. But this, with Kang and the Quantum realm, made it something special!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even though some professional critics think that this third outing of the Ant-Man and Wasp was not that good, ignore them. The film is about how strong family love is and what you would do to protect the ones you 
Love. Even if it isn't blood family or even the same species. This movie is pivotal for the upcoming Phase 5 and what is to come. So go enjoy yourself, have some laughs  and enjoy this BIG popcorn movie.
Also, STAY for bothe credit scenes, especially the one at the end...trust me!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Again don‚Äôt pay attention to the critics they don‚Äôt understand. The movie was great go watch it 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Antman and the Wasp Quantumania is the definition of a perfect movie. The story and timeline are perfect and the comedy was perfectly placed throughout the movie. The relationship between the characters developed more throughout the movie. The casting of the characters are perfect and the main threat Kang has finally entered the MCU. This movie is just the peak is of what is to come in the couple years. ‚ÄúThere will be conquering‚Äù-Kang
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie was pretty good at explaining but the only knock I have is  lack of fighting.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it!!! It had a good villain good movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, comfortable seats"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Please go see this movie in a theater in IMAX or 3D if you can--it's definitely worth it. Very fun & exciting, and while larger in scope and more important to the MCU than the first two, it still keeps the heart & soul of an Ant-Man film.  I just don't get the criticisms I've read! My wife & I are seeing it again on Saturday."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,loved it great start to phase 5 of the MCU
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably my favorite Antman movie yet. The overarching storyline of the Multiverse/Kang saga is starting to come into focus now. Excited to see what's to come in the MCU!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors is INCREDIBLE, the humor was good, it's exactly what you want in an Ant-Man movie to set up phase 5. I went in with low expectations due to the critic reviews, but enjoyed the movie a lot."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am fairly surprised at the current scores.  My kids and I loved this movie.  I could complain a small amount about a couple CGI things if I were being picky, but most of it was great!  

One of the villains popping up was a great story arc from previous movies.  Kang (J. Majors) was outstanding!  This is a great kick off to phase 5.

I could go way longer, but overall great movie showing off some amazing Quantum realm and multiverse stuff!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"pretty good! pacing was great, did not feel like over 2 hours. not my favorite, but i'm excited for more Kang"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good new age Marvel movie
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Part Ant-Man. Part Star Wars. Part Acid Trip. Part-y.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Healthy family relationships working through adversity. If this is the kind of media you want to see then go vote with your wallet.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfect start to Phase 5, the plot is simple and makes sense and Kang is a bad ass."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Starts slow but picks up fast. Great start to phase 5!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,And again it's been proven that you shouldn't always trust the critics!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good intro to phase 5. 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"SUCH A GREAT MOVIE

definitely worth the watch

the critics were WAY off on this one"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"When I saw the critic rating initially, I was shocked and thought it would be as bad as few that it has followed. However, the movie holds on its own. I would definitely give it around 7/10. It's not like the other Ant Man movies. It's less comedic but that is good for the type of story the movie wants us to see. Kang as the villain is great. Acting is not the best but that is easily hidden with the stunning visuals. Only 2 downsides for me were not enough character development for Kang - there is enough for the audience to understand his mission but there could have been more - which brings to my 2nd point. Movie could have been a little longer (10-15 min). This could have allowed for Kang to tell his story more."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Hella fun and good action. loved Kang
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is loud, funny, and has amazing visuals. It has some language and violence, but consistent with the other Ant-man movies. Kang is a powerful presence throughout the film. You just need to watch the avengers movies, Ant-man movies, and Captain America movies to understand it. The more things you watched, the more awesome it gets. The only reason it is not five stars is because it can be loud and was somewhat overwhelming my little brother who I took with me to see it. MODOK is very ugly, but his look is comic accurate. The film is not as comedic as the other Ant-man movies, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. I suggest rewatching the Ant-man movies because small things (pun intended) that were in the previous films will come back in unexpected ways. Overall, I loved the film and in some ways, it is some of the best in the MCU. I highly recommended staying for the post credit scenes. Ignore the critics. Ignore me. Watch it and make your own conclusions. Bye!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie fell flat and it kinda sucked tbh
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very good movie, does leave lots of plot holes and things undiscovered."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's bad, they should put more action, it is boring"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great start to Phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of good action and Kang is great!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a good film, fulfills and maintains the origins of the first two films of our dear ant man! Paul, Michelle, Jonathan, Evangeline and Kathryn were really great. It's more of an introduction to the saga, a new phase, and the film promises a lot about it. Leave that good will to know about the course of the multiversal saga, I feel it's going to be epic (still in the film we have the post credits scenes, simply impeccable that have a complete influence on the saga"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's remarkable how critics show more and more that they don't understand much.

Quantumania is a solid film, with a good script, development, plot, characters and spectacular CGI.

Janet, Majors, Scott and Hank have brilliant performances, without a doubt a good movie to watch."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A great way to start phase 5! Was an adventurous time into the world of the quantum realm and a scary peek into the terror of a new villain known as kang. Paul Rudd and cast were all stellar with the comedy you would expect from ant-man and the drama from introducing a new threat. Definitely worth going to the theater to experience and a must in IMAX.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved Kang. The movie was really funny and was action packed, cant wait to see what comes nextm"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pel√≠cula en si es muy buena, un CGI bueno no el m√°s espectacular que haya visto pero es muy bueno los personajes lo son m√°s en especial Jonathan Majors como Kang el conquistador, impuso miedo y respeto, adem√°s la escena final en donde Ant-Man y compa√±√≠a se enfrentan a Kang es lo m√°ximo de la pel√≠cula a mi gusto personal, estuvo bien. 4.5/5"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good mix of comedy, drama and action. Some good backstory and setting up the next phase of the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Wayy better than the critic reviews. Jonathan Majors as Kang is incredible. Cant wait to see more of him recking havoc
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang a cold character
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely better then Thor Love & Thunder or Dr. Strange! Had a lot of fun in the Quantum realm and Kang is everything I wanted to see!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A light, fun, family film that introduces the new Marvel villain well"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"my 4/5 rating is relative to the genre. obviously few of the superhero blockbusters are truly outstanding cinema. however, as far as what these films are and what they provide, this was one of the better outings, especially recently, from the MCU. It has heart, it's well written (for the most part). It's actually really well paced, which is unusual for these movies lately. The visuals are... questionable at times. The sheer amount of CGI needed to make something like this is just unimaginable. I think the quality of the visuals suffers from it. Not that the CGI itself is bad, it's just that most of the movie it was so badly integrated with the live action. It looked really unconvincing. I wish Marvel Studios would do fewer projects in order to make any of them look good. The design of the Quantum Realm had so much potential, and a lot of it is there and really works, but you do get taken out of it if you look too hard.

The actors' performances are standout here. Everyone nails it, even the cameo actors. Bill Murray nails it of course."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Much better then what the critics are saying. And Jonathan Majors ü§å and freaking MODOK ü§åü§å
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was entertaining. Not as funny as the first ones, missed some of the other characters. But overall it was fun."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"fun movie, fulfills its role of entertaining"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! One of the best since NWH! Wish it was a little longer so the story could flow more easy
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was. great movie in my opinion. Kang is a very compelling villain and Majors does a fantastic job in the role. As always with Ant-Man there is a lot of humor but still manages to be serious as well. I definitely say to give it a try!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The pacing was not as good as most Marvel films. I read reviews about Dr. Strange's Multiverse of Madness prior to watching it and despite the negative insights, I came in with an open mind and enjoyed it (same with Thor Love and Thunder), so I wasn't deterred by the critics' score. This was enjoyable with a few chuckles, but not entirely memorable gags, and had some good ideas behind the storytelling like the ants and the Kardashev scale. This is not bad, but DIFFERENT, like an adolescent MCU for this film and for this entire Phase."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"That rotten tomatoes score is so wrong, I had a great time watching this movie. If anything I have two nitpicks: 1) Cassie typical kid making typical mistakes 2) sense of scale is hard to determine just cause they are in the quantum realm. Ant man is best on earth where our sense of scale is dialed in. Other than those two minor things this is probably the third best marvel movie after Shang-Chi and Spider-Man NWH"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel did it again, making an amazing movie and more to come!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Graphic humor all good
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel continuing downward trend, relying on hype to fill theater seats but delivering mediocre nonsensical plots."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The third and possibly final solo Ant-Man film also kicks off Marvel's Phase Five and by now, I'm glad the little guy has his chance to shine as he is an overlooked character. The stakes are high on this film as Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), his daughter Cassie (played by newcomer Kathryn Newton), Hope Van Dyne (Evangline Lilly), and her parents Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) are all transported to the Quantum Realm. Broken off into 2 factions upon their arrival (Scott/Cassie and Hope/Hank/Janet), they attempt to find each other but while doing so, learn about Janet's previous experience in the Quantum Realm, as well as cross paths with Marvel's newest big baddie Kang the Conqueror (played deliciously by Johnathan Majors). Visually the film is almost a Star Wars/Marvel crossover. A simple enough story about family and a father who'll stop at nothing to protect his daughter. Majors here is the brightest shinning star, which is quite the compliment considering the rest of the A-list talent he's sharing the screen with. He's a devil in disguise: enormously powerful but he's seductive with his soft spoken manner. I'm very much anticipating how he continues his journey through phases 5 & 6 but brilliant casting on this one. Maybe the best Ant-Man of the trilogy (honestly it's been a while since I've seen the first 2) and my only knock was the final battle between the family and Kang as a few times it became too much visually."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best ant-man movie by far. Sets up the next big bad perfectly. Honestly this might be the best Marvel movie since endgame.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the weird craziness.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film tried too hard to set up the new big bad and the next phase it forgot to give Ant-Man and the Wasp proper character arcs, let alone an satisfying trilogy capper."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I just couldn't take it that seriously. It reminded me of an elaborate Saturday morning SiFi cartoon.  It was goofy at times, juvenile and the inhabitants were weird. 

Jonathan Majors could have been great but his role was very diluted. I sure hope they make him more of the central character next time. I also can't imagine AntMan defeating Kang. 

Please bring back the writers of the early days of the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it! I missed Ant-Man's friends but Kang was outstanding and I can't wait to see what happens next!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie for phase 5.  Not quite as awesome as Ant man and the wasp.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well done story with great future implications!

Throughout enjoyed it!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie has some conveniences that can't be overlooked and also some incogruities but Jonathan majors acting was very good and carried the whole movie

Overall it was a very fun movie to watch"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie. A lot of context is needed from prior Marvel content but it was a fun action movie and it setup the villain very well.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's not a great movie, but it did a good job of introducing the villain named Kang, after watching it I was eagerly waiting for the next developments in the MCU movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as the critics said, but not Marvel's best. Jonathan Majors rules."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I think the movie was so good but could be a better movie because kang was so good but the bad side of the movie it was MODOK, but I enjoy the movie"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie ever !!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie felt a bit juvenile. I think the quantum realm was cool looking but the inhabitants made no sense. I did actually like MODOK. Jonathan Majors was shortchanged screen time. He is so good but his role in the movie was just not enough. I really miss the early days of the MCU through ENDGAME and Black Widow. 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid start of the phase 5. Kang and Scott were awesome
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"N√£o √© oitava maravilha do mundo, mas tambem n√£o √© uma porcaria, para mim o saldo foi positivo."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film was going awesome until the ending made it a huge disappointment, and they could have done a better job keeping two of the Beloved villains characters alive with a twist.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Little too sci-fi.. characters personas changed but overall I love Kang and love how much he‚Äôs involved now.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Ant-Man yet and a great overall MCU film. With strong performances from the entire cast and great action along with classic quips and jokes wrapped around a family theme, my entire family had a great time! Jonathan Majors is menacing and brilliant as Kang! We can't wait to see more of him. I will be seeing Quantumania in at least 3 different screen types. Screen X and IMAX are up next!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is this movie perfect? No
Is this movie a masterpiece? No
Is this movie for everyone? No.

Is this movie good? Yes, absolutely. It's fun as hell, wacky as all get out, literally one of the campiest movies ever put out by Marvel and I'm here for it.
Kang is incredible, Jonathan Majors is an absolute knock out.

Go see this movie, screw the critics."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"With the aftertaste of Phase 4 still freshly stale in my mouth, the proper introduction of Kang completely surprises & surpasses all hopes and expectations of Jonathan Major's acting chops. He was BORN to be Kang!

Fantastic creature/world designs truly evolves the imagination of what's possible below the surface of possibilities. You can't get any better than this!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"mto bom pra come√ßar a fase 5, divertidissimo e mto engra√ßado, e esse kang, AI ESSE KANG VIU... primeiro vil√£o q me da medo na marvel"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Wonderful entry into phase 5 and possibly the best Antman movie!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania was an absolutely SPECTACULAR film to end off the Ant-Man trilogy within the MCU, FANTASTIC way to start off Phase 5 of The Multiverse Saga and an AMAZING introduction to Jonathan Majors‚Äô Kang The ConquerorüíØüòùüòéüêúüêù‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Very funny and thrilling
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,another good movie from marvel i really enjoyed it SEE IT
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang‚Ä¶just Kang üíØüíØüíØmarvel on the road to a comeback 2023üî•
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's Marvel. It's always a good time. Paul Rudd is always delightful and funny! Jonathan Majors is a great villain and brings a lot to Marvel's newest big bad
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I was expecting more. First Marvel movie that made me sleep!! :(
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't believe the nonsensical negative reviews‚Ä¶ this was super fun and easily more enjoyable than the last three MCU films!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a great movie! I have no idea what the critics were on about. All the actors were on point, the story was good, the CGI was much better than it has been, and Kang was an AWESOME villain."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Worst Ant-Man film IF it were to be like the previous two. But because it was so different from the previous films, it actually was pretty good! The film did struggle to have a solid foundation to track the film to the end, nor do we find out anything more about Kang‚Äôs intentions than we already know from Loki Season 1 and what ‚Äúcould come,‚Äù from the comics. The film felt somewhat like a mini Avengers movie but without the Avengers, instead three shrinking-enabled (and enlarging) individuals, their seniors, and an army of angry natives, and‚Ä¶you guess it, robotic ants. It felt like a beginning piece of a larger narrative, and yes all Marvel productions are supposed to tie into each other, but this felt a lacking of being it‚Äôs own film with a understanding and satisfying ending, whether it be a positive or negative ending (such as Infinity War). Even the mid and post-credit scenes don‚Äôt lend us any additional information than we already know, on the intent or reasoning that Kang has moving forward, mainly Marvel-fan eye-candy. And also how is it that Cassie‚Äôs machine at the beginning of the film, can only send a signal to the Quantum Realm to create a map, but by its end, all of a sudden be able to create a portal back to Earth?
The film, seemingly to have an existential threat as Kang The Conqueror, didn‚Äôt really feel like it at all, barely any of the hero‚Äôs got severely injured and a death was assumed to occur or a hero left behind, but never occurs. With as morbid as it may sound, narratively, any of those scenarios could have made for a better story. Even The Wasp, whose name is on the title, saw very little screen time. But there was enough emotion to make it good and plenty of laughs, as is typical and expected comedy from an Ant-Man film. And visually it was great. All in all, it wasn‚Äôt terrible."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! I was on the edge of my seat for 80% of the film. Never since Infinity War have I been left with such a disquieting feeling. Whoa!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are killjoy. Loved this film. Ignore negative clickbait. Kang is terrifying. It worked for me. And there are lots of laughs.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Worked really well, decent pacing, a lot of laughs. Jonathan majors is a great part of this movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No words, I miss the great Avengers movies."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"WIth the exception of a few fun and interesting characters that were in the Quantum Realm - and the realm itself, the story was somewhat lackluster. If you'd like to see a great landscape, go see it. For a fun and hilarious Ant-Man movie like the previous two, then you might want to just rewatch the others."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Film√£o, KANG est√° sombrio, CGI muito top, delicia de assistir, SCOTT √©pico ‚ù§"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um coment√°rio de um f√£, eu gostei muito desse filme, n√£o me decepcionei em nenhum aspecto, fiquei muito mais hypado para as futuras produ√ß√µes."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best marvel movie I've seen in a LOOOOOONG time. Hated Thor, hated Wakanda forever, hated multiverse of madness. This one made me love Marvel again.  Kang is a brilliant villain and I can't wait to see more of him‚Ä¶.in all of his many many many forms."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. I loved every second.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved this movie; it was so much fun, and visually awesome. Janet stepped up big time, Cassie was great, and even Hank had a major upgrade. Loved the use of the Ants as it felt like a culmination of the trilogy coming together. Kang was absolutely amazing as expected."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of Good!!! Kang was perfect and Mr. Majors couldn't be more treacherous for the future of the MCU!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really more so a 7.5/10 but it was over all good, not the greatest, but it‚Äôs at least good."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't know why I was expecting great things from an Antman movie, it passes the time I guess..."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A little formulamatic, but still throughly enjoyable."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Saw it again and it was still a great movie. Still enjoy all of the actors performances especially Jonathan Majors as Kang. Can‚Äôt wait to see where Ant-Man and his family go next especially since Ant-Man‚Äôs daughter could be part of the Young Avengers.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is fantastic and does not deserve the hate that it has gotten from critics!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"SPOILER FREE :)
Great addition to the MCU. Johnathan Majors gets to finally dive into the character of Kang and he does a fanominal job. Can't wait to see what he can bring to the character in future films. As always, Paul Rudd hit the nail on the head and new addition Kathryn Newton stuck out in the best way possible as Cassie. Pulling Micheal Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer out of the retirement home was a smart move because they worked great in the supporting cast. Overall, Quantumania was a fantastic start to phase 5 of the MCU and a perfect solo outing for Antman & Co. (But I wish Evangeline Lily had a bit more screentime)"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ambitious and visually stunning, with a lot of heart."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Don‚Äôt believe the haters, this was a good movie. Just remember, it‚Äôs never too late to stop being a d!@¬•"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sad truth is that it‚Äôs not a very cohesive story most of the time, but due to what has come before, it‚Äôs a major improvement. I laughed more than Thor or doctor strangest latest outings in theaters. For a real introduction to the next big bad, I think marvel did pretty good. The only real nitpick I have is the Janet kept such a secret from everyone. Not only would  none of the movie ever happen, she fails to explain until it‚Äôs convenient to the plot who Kang is. I also did miss Scott‚Äôs little gang that were in the previous 2 movies. This was an enjoyable movie for me that did better in more ways than what phase 4 has done."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty solid start for phase 5.  Kang is here!! He was awesome!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful world, so spacey and fulfilling.  Slow to roll at first, but Marvel has the formula down"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan majors was a beast best marvel villain yet can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next !
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Mordok scenes were horrible. Kang was defeated by ants!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was the WORST movie of Antman trilogy. MCU has lost its formula. A lot of ancillary talks, lack continuity, once again they undermined great villain to promote societal messages.

MODOK was underwhelming. Kang was a great character but he lacks the weight and conviction of Thanos. I believe that this version of Kang would have been the next big bad villain. Jonathan Majors did an excellent job, but the writers did not deliver the character which we deserved as an audience. 

This is a movie one can wait to watch on Disney+."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,If you loved both ant man movies you will definitely like this one. Great paced balanced comedy. Kang was amazing
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie, the quantum realm is beautiful"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked this movie, it's funny and gets serious when it needs to. I loved kang and I love how they are setting up the future. Plus is visually stunning, I never noticed bad cgi on this movie not even modok looked that bad. But I must say that this isn't like any other ant man movie, it's not a third part but more of an episode one of what's yet to come. The post credits are crazy and just what I wanted. Marvel is back."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best and better than thor love and thunder or doctor strange 2, eternals,black widow"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely the best Ant-Man film so far. Best moment without spoilers ‚ÄúI HAVE HOLES!‚Äù
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,This was not a bad film but it was not a great film either. They just did to much with the wrong character. Kang was by far the best thing!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was only good cus of Kang and the ants ‚Ä¶the overall theme in relation to the MCU is good too
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"kang carries, did not like ending"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is actually very good!  Do not understand why top critics give such a bad rating!  This movie is actually one of the best Marvel films!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I went to see this in standard because the critic score was low but they were wrong it is definitely IMAX worthy easily the best marvel movie since No Way Home and now one of the best trilogies they've done I would say number 2 behind Captain America's
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Hilarious! A little rushed but very action packed! Been a marvel fan since Avengers so reviews mean a lot to me! It‚Äôs very great for entertainment and an even greater start for the new Saga!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it first entry to the kang dynasty!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's not my favorite Ant-Man movie but It's ok
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,After those end credit scenes... Whoever's left of the main Avengers lineup is screwed.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"O filme √© bem divertido, bacana para assistir com a fam√≠lia!! Achei as piadas no tom certo. Diferente de Thor!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun whimsical ride that was super weird but overall a good time. Like everyone has been saying, Kang steals the show. Great way to set up the beginning of a new phase (dynasty)."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman and the wasp Quantumania is far and wide the grandest adventure the duo has embarked on, boasting plentiful visual landscapes and rather interesting characters in a world where we already have talking raccoons, the movie sets its entirety in the quantum realm and the artistry is beautifully done as well as giving the eye something to see around every corner, Antman's character growth is shown on full display in his most desperate hour as his incentive to win is his daughter Cassie who is now sporting her own suit and powers, her addition is rather subtle but welcomed, the humor manages to land at every turn despite the situation being highly tense in a patented marvel way, none of it feels forced or cheesy but relatable in a rather unorthodox manner, the true shining star is Jonathan Simmons as Kang the conqueror and the surprise of M.O.D.O.K as Darren from antman 1, Kangs consistent determination to free himself is really easy to fear as not only a marvel fan but a movie goer in general he manages to make every scene with him in it tense or menacing which is only enhanced by the scope of his powers alongside his more then intelligent dialogue, Kang is set up perfectly for future projects without giving too much away and I think it serves the movie best that we didn't see all of what Kang is capable of, another highlight of the movie is the uneasiness and anxiety it makes us feel in scenes such as the multiplying ant men or the final scene where Lang is left to question if everything truly is alright after they ride off into the sunset not knowing whether the threat of the conqueror has truly been extinguished, slight nuances in how Rudd's facial expressions show disdain and tension really drive home the point that Lang is no longer unscarred or without fear because he has seen how bad things can get going and if his daughter truly is safe, Antman and the wasp quantamania also boasts great supporting roles in the form of Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeifer reprising the roles of Hank Pym and Janet Van dyne in a useful and always easy to admire manner, all in all the movie lands the hammer on the head of the nail by giving way to what the future may hold for not only antman but the entire family and progressively showing you that the understanding of the quantum realm is ever changing and that new threats are at every turn, for me it is one of the shining stars of the MCU's latest phase and I believe it may also be one of the most important based on those end credit scenes."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Critics are trippin it‚Äôs a solid movie something‚Äôs are not great but it‚Äôs no where near as bad as they make it seem
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the VFX, I felt like this was Avatar 3. The actors were amazing, however, I felt let down when Modok ask how he could be good, cut that part and the movie was incredible, I loved Kang and the mystery in what comes after this."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,what happen marvel????????
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn‚Äôt watch it yet 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved every second of it! The critics had me worried but ended up being a solid, and hilarious movie!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Decent Movie, Definitely wasn't a perfect movie, BUT Kang was great"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The plot, the action, the humor, everything. The best movie in the series so far!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I see the issues some people have, the film in it's entirety is an exposition dump for the main villain, bad CGI in places, but I think the hate it's receiving from critics is a tad bit overblown. The film never loses the lighthearted atmosphere of the first two films while taking on a much more serious tone in places, and overall is a ""fun romp"" that sets up exciting things for the future of the MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,La pel√≠cula estuvo a mi gusto buen√≠sima kang estuvo imponente las escenas post cr√©ditos WOW solo me decepcion√≥ modok de resto me encant√≥
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved Quantumania!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,so so not good quite bad. I'm a big fan of ant-man but everything in this movie is differrence from they did before. the first ant-man movie is better.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great sequel for this duo
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"No preaching at the audience in this movie, critics are mad because its not a 3+ hour love affair to pandering BS and actually supports what fans wanted.
Establishes an actual arch for the next phase of MCU.
Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lily & Kathryn Newton are awesome together."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It‚Äôs Marvel. It‚Äôs always a good time. Paul Rudd is always delightful and funny! Jonathan Majors is a great villain and brings a lot to Marvel‚Äôs newest big bad.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pelicula muy plana, al final no se llega a nada."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Better then Thor. Not as good as new Black Panther
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this was a very solid outing, and don't understand the critics' harsh treatment. Jonathan Majors as Kang is a joy to behold, and the Quantum Realm was vividly brought to life as a completely alien environment that only devolves into ""CGI mud"" once or twice towards the end. It's not a perfect movie, but it's definitely in the top quarter of MCU films. Looking forward to seeing more Kang(s)."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. Good action and decent cgi. Kang is here!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors CARRIED this movie!!!! Solid intro to Phase 5, I enjoyed it"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Big budget leads to some great visuals. Kang was great. And that's about it. Cassie was a lacking character with some cringe scenes. Poor direction. No Luis. Ending sucked.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,LOVED IT! GREAT START TO PHASE 5. KANG IS COMING
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,good start for phase 05
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, entertaining, introduced new characters, kang steals the show, fast paced. Don't understand the bad reviews. Just watch the movie, don't see the reviews and neglect the critics."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"AWESOME MOVIE!!  All the characters had a chance to shine.  Nobody was undermined.  Antman kicked some ass!  There were no politics or agendas injected into the film, either.  It's just a fun flick.  Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquerer killed it.  He establishes himself as the next big bad and will be a force to be reckoned with in the future. Great movie, folks."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jonathan Majors shines through a fog of bland, uninteresting characters and visuals."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was good! Not at all as bad as the critics say. It was a fun adventure, a good intro for Kang. Post credit scenes that actually matter! Some corny moments but it did't ruin the movie. 
Personally I don't think critics reviews should come out until the movie is out I don't understand why critic reviews come out a week early."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Grade A ridiculum slathered in visual spectacle, with a peppering of coy humor"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Es una buena pel√≠cula y ya est√°, no es lo mejor que ceras en el g√©nero ni tampoco es un bodrio como batman v superman. Entretiene y ya. Lo m√°s flojo es modok."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watched this I'm IMAX 3D and thought it was awesome . I didn't like a lot of phase 4 and was getting bored with Marvel but I really enjoyed The Multiversal storyline of this , Loki and the last Spider-Man and Doctor Strange Films so I'm intrigued with where this story is heading . Great acting , great cast and a lot of action and great moments and a lot of fun ."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the film.  Do not understand the low reviews.  It is significantly better than Thor: Love and Thunder.  Funny, thrilling, with a great villain."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you watch the movie in context of what Marvel is doing on the grand scale of things, you will enjoy this movie very much as the first chapter of a multichapter story. The best thing to have watched going into this movie is the first season of the Loki show on Disney+. We enjoyed it going in knowing what Kang is capable of and expecting him to be the biggest Marvel baddie yet. It was great entertainment. Since we weren't invested in most of the characters that died in the movie, you don't feel the impact of the severity of Kang's power. I can't wait to see how this Kang Saga plays out. Be sure to watch the 2 post credit scenes."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I see what some of the reviewers and podcasters are saying with their reviews - but I also think when it's not your job to break these things down, you can remember to be a fan and a kid and embrace the ride as much as you analyze the film elements. I had a great time, loved some of the story beats, enjoyed the weirdness and how it is balanced by the seriousness. Will definitely rewatch in 3D :)"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's was fun. A little to close to a Disney+ movie. But that's the fuck up on Disney's part, you know ringing the rag of ever drop. But I do get it. 
So all that said, again it was fun, it moved fast and I left with a souvenir Antman head popcorn holder. So you know, yeah‚Ä¶"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great set up for the start of Phase 5 and the reign of Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,A solid start to the next phase. Everyone has a role to play and the story unfolds at a decent pace. Excited for the next installment.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this film Perfect, I loved, family film"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The first and second act is great. Loved Scott and Cassie (Kathryn Newton is awesome). Stunning visuals and interesting action! The problem lies in the climax on third act, once there is no consequences and the villains falls flat."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know why this is getting review bombed. But it was good. I enjoyed it, that's what matters, I supposed. If you enjoyed the film or not, if you're looking forward to the bigger picture, which is what this film does. I get that we loved the humor on the previous Ant-Man Movies and it's great that they veered off from the usual Ant-Man plot not really contributing much to the plot of the MCU as a whole (except for the post credit scene of Ant Man and the Wasp which totally led to the time heist on Endgame). Anyway, seeing Kang on the screen and all his variants was great. 
This movie may not be enjoyed by those who do not follow MCU as a whole, but for those of us who do, we loved it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A good clean family movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I actually enjoyed Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Visually stunning, great acting and some comedy as usual but you also get to see a more serious side to Ant-Man. It got really intense towards the end ü´£ Would have loved to see more of Kang though, incredible performance from Jonathan Majors he stole the show! Please don't let negative reviews influence your decision not to watch. Please go and watch this movie and form your own opinion."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I have enjoyed a 3 Ant-man movies and the crossover with Paul Ruud. He is Ant-man. I think the story line moved well. I was into the movie from the start and it never dragged. Kang is such a great Villian and Majors plays him well. The whole film felt we have moved past the lull we had before. The biggest disappointment for me is M.O.D.O.K that could have been a much better baddie and even moved to other movies as in the comics. He was the only flop I saw. Ok Im not a fan of cussing either and the use of GD bothered me. Ok now to say Very well done and it was overall a fun movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I found it the best of marvel movies after endgame. After endgame the marvel films have been disappointing to say the least. This is different. Good cast, good story, and great special effects. This is antman, if u go in just to be entertained this is 4u. by the way Johnathan majors dipection of Kane is amazing."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie ever, I mean... Kang was defeated by ant man... common man, he said that he killed a lot of avengers before and he lost against ant man... LOL"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great family dynamic loved it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"me gust√≥ mucho, la mejor de la trilog√≠a de ant man sin duda"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Actually really enjoyed it, kang was great, paul rudd was good,modok cracked me up, good start for phase 5"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Literally not that bad tbh, kind of corny, but worth watching."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the type of weird and strange we all wanted in Multiverse of Madness! What a fun ride all the way through. It is so awesome seeing comic books come to life like this. They were able to balance the fun of the previous Ant-Man movies, with upping the stakes and pitting him against a big bad. If you like fun, go see it."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good film, and A nice start to Phase 5, Kang was awesome!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's visually extraordinary to watch and the atmosphere of the world-building is fantastic the terror that kang brings is real this is the best movie in phase 4 so far.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film is cool I don't know what it did not suit the critics. How could they see poor graphics in the cinema. The film is cool, it evokes emotions. Kang turned out very cool. All the protagonists are very charismatic, the most quantum dimension looks fresh and very colorful"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pel√≠cula entretenida, cumple siendo una pel√≠cula de introducci√≥n al nuevo villano kang dentro de una pel√≠cula del mas infravalorado avenger."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, Awesome, Great must watch highly recommend"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film. Heard it compared to Star Wars but felt more like organisms instead of space. 2 hours flew by. Loved the post credit scenes. Bring on Kang!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Can't wait to see what comes next with Kang!!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The marvel movies have taken a hard left in the wrong direction, way too much trying to be star wars. literally only stayed for the Easter egg at the end"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie that keeps elements of the first 2 Ant-Man movies while taking a more serious approach. Visuals are one of the best I've ever seen in marvel, and Jonathan majors is amazing. Great start to Phase 5 and looking forward to what's to come."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, I love how the story continues. Great job Marvel Studios. I can‚Äôt wait to see how you build the next stage."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"¬øQue has hecho Marvel?, esta pelicula debio ser la mejor entrada para la fase 5 pero termino siendo un desperdicio de elenco y de un villano que daba todo el arranque para esta fase"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not a good film. Recommend waiting for it to drop on Disney+ if you're going to watch it.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a great family movie & start to Phase 5. My boys enjoyed the experienced shared & can't wait for Loki Season 2 aka More Kang.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The CGI is stunning and the history is also good. Kang isn't that powerful but he will be a big threat soon! I love Scott Lang!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The family is the core of this film and each piece brought there on fresh take to this film
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Alright, so I just saw the next installment of The MCU & The Ant-Man Franchise and I'd like to start off by saying without SPOILERS‚Ä¶ Yet again, all the negativity that The MCU & The Multiverse Saga is getting is NOT Needed! The Cinematic Universe isn't the same as it was with The Infinity Saga & that's okay! Move on, you can appreciate what that Saga was but, like time & life, we have to move forward.

You can feel anyway you want about the film but, if this film taught me anything, choose your own path and have your own opinions. 
Change, Growth & Courage are aspects of life & evolution that are Inevitable and you can't Conquer them, they happen and Marvel Studios is showcasing that and I think that's why everyone is causing backlash‚Ä¶
People don't like Change ever but, you can't go back in time without seeing and causing issues and this Saga is expanding on that life lesson.
Control is not the answer either, we saw what happened to Thanos for trying to do that.
This film was true to Director: Peyton Reed and his vision for The VanDyne-Lang Team!

In my honest opinion,
The Multiverse Saga and how it's expanding too has been a fascinating experience to watch, witness and learn about. 
The direction that Marvel Studios has been heading to is finally branching and blending into the main timeline.
The Entire MCU is truly going to become THEE NEXUS event & not one single character is going to be the ONLY Nexus being!

This film was the BEST cinematographic films to date imo, this film had a great story, character development, humor, beautiful animation, energy & excitement! I also have to give a special thanks to whoever let them swear a lot‚Ä¶ FINALLY!!! 
The film industry's biggest upgrade to their storytelling has been the advancements in technology.

And to end with this, to bring back the street-level, hand-to-hand combat has been excellent to continue. 
This film has quite a few surprising cameos and they made sense. Know this‚Ä¶ try your damndest to be BIGGER than the haters! 8.5/10 ‚≠êÔ∏ès"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania does a decent job balancing the MCU as a whole and developing the characters
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I really loved the new introduction of the new phase! Kang is definitely going to take those smiles away from everyone soon!
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"üö®SPOILERY‚ÄºÔ∏è Just viewed Ant-Man¬†and the Wasp Quantumania¬†uhh‚Ä¶ I'll say this kick-off to the MCU's Phase 5 was an ambitious story by Jeff Loveness & Peyton Reed. PROS: Jonathan Majors as KANG, and the Quantum creatures were interesting. CONS: The dialogue was very corny and not very entertaining throughout the film. A big error was having the Ant Family defeat Kang The Conqueror which made the stakes and Kang's supposed ""build up"" feel very NOT believable and cheap. I'd say 2.5 out of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è Post Credits were the highlight to this experience‚ÄºÔ∏èüò¨ The KANG¬†¬†¬†variants look DOPE in both post credits, my favorite look was Victor Timely and who I think may have been Immortus. Kevin Feige I expected better üíØ"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie overall was a fun watch! Some moments landed some didn't but I enjoyed this much more than the second installment.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It amazes me how disconnected the ""critics"" have gotten with some of these movies. I get it regarding ""Marvel fatigue"", but to say this movie lacks excitement, story, etc. is just ridiculous. Yes, this Ant Man was not the comedic romp that 1 (or even 2) was, but it didn't need to be. It still had its light moments, but this was meant to be more than just a lighthearted flick, and it succeeded. There was genuine heart and soul, and the visuals were epic. This was a spectacular kick-off to Phase 5. The movie is about family and about doing the right thing, and it was a pleasure to watch."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a beautiful movie!!  It's not perfect and we all knew that, but it delivered what I envisioned.  Kang being the best character in the movie, the Quantum Realm is too beautiful, and the 2 post credits scenes...really...I couldn't leave the cinema without seeing them!  I really liked the movie, I recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a good movie, very beautiful and with a villain who will still deliver a lot."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,My son and I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun and entertaining.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Went into this excited (For Kang ofc) Kang was great, everything else was very mid. The vfx were honestly terrible and it was noticeably so. The dialogue and camera work was another thing that was lacking imo unprofessional opinion. The dialogue was cringey and the camera work was jarring. Ultimately a huge disappointment."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Being a comic book nerd, I can tell you this movie for true marvel fans is revolutionary. Paves the way for the future, introduces marvels new big bad, and has a good blend of serious and humorous tones. Highly recommend!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't get all the hate from critics. It's better than any dc movie. It's like they were expecting Oscar caliber content instead of standard MCU super hero stuff. If that's the case, then who's the real idiot?"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Everyone's right about how the first half of the movie drags on and on to the point its teasing you by how much you'll love the last half. Basically, it kills any fun to be had in a brand new world that's left in the dust. But its worth sticking around for what will be Marvel's next big bad played brilliantly by Jonathan Majors."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just got back from watching this movie. I don't care what the critics say, I ENJOYED IT! Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd get 5 out of 5 stars from me. I'm looking forward to seeing how this whole multiverse saga continues and ends!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang has a menacing screen presence and Paul Rudd's charisma is just fun to watch. The story may be a little bit underwhelming, but it does serve its purpose of kick-starting the Phase 5 and setting up the future of MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this movie a lot.  Story had a nice pace to it. in parts the CGI was shotty but over all the effects were real good.  Is it as good as the first two movies?  No it wasn't but it is still very good.  See it, you will enjoy it if you liked the first ones."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very Guardian's of the Galaxy
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't listen to critics this movie was amazing üî•
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing I loved everything the kang dynasty had started!!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"After kind of a slow start, that movie just got better and better!
No spoilers but heres a few cryptic quotes:
That guy looks like broccoli!
Theyre not baby legs!
What the hell? What the hell? What the hell? What the hell? 
Ill die first. 18147. Damn. 
I have holes!
Its never too late to stop being a dick"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie visuals were astounding and Johnathan Majors kills it as Kang. can't wait to see more
Of him. Def worth the price of admission"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It had great vfx and good performances but the writing was a mess and the third act was the worst part by a mile.  Another Ant-Man entry where virtually nothing was accomplished and this one wasn't nearly as funny as the previous ones.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are crazy! This film is a fun badass adventure. Please go see for yourself and wait for Credits at the end!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I was rooting for Kang the whole movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE, BEWARE OF BAD REVIEWS ON RT. Bots/critics are review bombing this movie, it seems like every one star review only has 1 review on its account, is newly made and doesn't even say anything related to the movie. It was review bombed before the movie even came out.

The critics are a bunch of idiots that conformed to thinking this was a bad movie because the first critics said it was, this movie is good. Actually really well done, jonathon majors steals the spotlight as Kang and so does MODOK. 

The movie has done an amazing job at setting up the tone of Phase 5 and the cgi was outstanding! 

Props to everyone at the marvel studio, I'm excited to see more of Kang in the future!!!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,a here we go again not even gonna talk bout it anymore mcu just end it is so bad good that jonathan majors exists
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very bad movie. Marvel Lost his way
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Best movie in Phase 5 no doubt !!!!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Exciting start for phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Super good!!!! There are two extra scenes so stay till the end. Very beautiful movie to watch.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a huge joke is that movie !!
felt like a silly episode of an Ant-man series, noting funny about the jokes in the movie, the drama isn't heart-felt, the acting was mediocre at best. 
ant that is the start of phase 5 !!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,watch out for the little guy...
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's an Ant-Man movie, so it was funny and had a lot of action. Definitely a good start to Phase 5."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly this is by far one of the best Ant Man and Marvel movie since End Game, the way they introduce Kang The Conquer, there is more to come and the way to introduce the Quantum universe was amazing, if anyone didn't like this movie, they don't fully appreciate MCU."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Achei o filme muito bom, a cr√≠tica especializada est√° totalmente emocionada com essa rejei√ß√£o toda."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Goofy and all over the place, doesn't have any rewatch value and is very forgettable."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning...Paul Rudd remains as likeable as ever - solid introduction to the next big, bad...looking forward to the ride!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,where to begin? This is what cinema is all about. The magnificent. The highs and lows. The audience satisfaction. Watch this movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought it was alright. In my honest opinion, they dumbed down Kang a lot, if this was how we were introduced to Thanos, where they beat him the first time then we wouldn‚Äôt have had the feelings we had in Infinity War and Endgame. Yes this is ONE variant of infinite Kangs, but I just feel like even this one interaction of this level of big-bad coming to the MCU, should of had higher stakes this earlier on into Phase 5 and 6. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, movie was decent."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Humour, storyline, action, excellent villain and some blasts from the past. This one had everything we've come to expect from the MCU, including 2 killer post credit scenes."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Uma boa aventura para toda fam√≠lia, apesar de alguns di√°logos sem no√ß√£o, o filme mantem o padr√£o de aventura do UCM e traz o Kang que rouba a cena deixando um gosto de quero mais nas novas apari√ß√µes dele. Nota 7."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A visual masterpiece.  Great story. Can't wait to see what Jonathan Majors does with the character, but so far, he has knocked it out of the park."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn't have high expectations for this movie but damn this is a good one! These actors can really bring these characters to life just wow.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Let me start my review of Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania by saying I sure miss the Russo Brothers. I'm shocked Kevin Feige approved AMATWQ. It was so bad that I fell asleep for a few minutes in the theater. 
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:
- MODOK. It was completely unnecessary and contributed nothing to the plot.
- MODOK. It was stupid.
- MODOK. The VFX were awful.
- The humor. The references to holes and d**** was childish.
- The idea that you can drink something and then understand foreign languages was silly.
- Bill Murray. His role should have been given to someone else.
- The idea that the ants got lost somewhere in time but were nowhere to be found until the third act was too farfetched even for someone who believes in the quantum realm.
- I'm particularly disappointed that this was the first movie that Kang appears in. Jonathan Majors deserves better.
WHAT I LIKED
- The end-credit scene with Kang, Loki, and Mobius.
*** Kevin Feige please fix this. ***"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome entry into the marvel universe‚Äôs next big bad. Great visuals and action but high stakes going into the future. Great movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Acting you'd expect from seasoned veterans, including memorable moments with Jonathan Majors backed with quality CGI. The plot, however, is one we've seen done many times throughout the MCU, albeit with a different facade."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is another superhero movie with a relatable family story line. This opens a new chapter in the long chronicle of Marvel Comics but at the same time trying to over simplify quantum Physics. If you don't mind the bastardization of quantum physics, you would love it. And if you love drama, John Majors brought back pure theatrical drama that has left Superhero movie. He single handedly stole the movie. Enjoy it."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,it wasn‚Äôt very good honestly‚Ä¶. the pacing was way off and the villain was lack luster sad to say‚Ä¶
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's funny and entertaining, the best ant man film yet. Also, the post credits scene are amazing. Finally, the soundtrack is a Masterpiece, Christophe Beck is one of the best composers Marvel ever had. 
The first act is wierd because of the runtime it goes too fast and some parts it feels the script power. 
Phase 5 looks promesing."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall enjoyed watching Quantumania with my kids. My kids really enjoyed it. 

Pros: 
+ Kang is perfect. Majors nails it. He is absolutely menacing when crossed. 

+ Without spoiling, ending has me excited for what is to come - both in Disney+ shows and for the larger films.

+ Janet shines!

+ I get the Star Wars comparisons, but it didn't bother me - I thought the world looked good and was visually interesting.

Cons:

+ Pacing was a miss. The beginning of the film felt rushed, but ending was well done.

+ Some absurdity is expected, but not all jokes landed for me (or the rest of my theater)

+ Some lazy plot writing

Still, the sum was greater than the parts, and I enjoyed it better than the first two AntMan movies. Solid B for me."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm pretty sure this was written by fifth-graders. As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie...Jonathan Majors hit it out of the park along with the cast regulars. A must-see for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best adventure,amazing cgi,but too short for me,need 3 hours of this film"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved so much, kang is amazing"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,only 4 stars because the movie is short
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme me divertiu muito, do in√≠cio ao fim, tem seus defeitos claro, mas eles n√£o se sobressaem, na minha experi√™ncia claro. Destaque pro Kang do Jhonatan Majors, que eu achei sensacional, gostei muito da ambienta√ß√£o do reino qu√¢ntico, bem √∫nico o visual, efeitos visuais muito bons, atua√ß√µes muito boas, cenas de a√ß√£o boas, essa foi a minha experi√™ncia, gostei bastante do filme, nota 7,5/10."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie felt a little bit lacking in the beginning but quickly picks up when Kang comes in. I can't understand the hate at all and will most likely never understand it. Really solid film for me.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a fun comic book come to life. It‚Äôs shorter than a lot of the marvel movies have been and that‚Äôs a good thing. It never felt dragging. No wasted time. It stays busy without feeling rushed. The introduction of the next big villain was well done and I look forward to the next installment.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I would give it a 75%, the professional reviewers that avaraged a 54% should look for new jobs."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,it was awesome super fun to learn about a new world and watch the really cool second half. super colorful and fun I really like it. thanks Mr rudd really liked your movie :)
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you're an MCU fan, this one's a lot of fun. Kang is great as the main antagonist. And the entertaining dynamics between Hank, Hope, Scott, and Janet that lit up the previous two Ant-Man films shine through here (now with Cassie in the mix, which was great). The film sets the stakes high for upcoming MCU films but also manages to be funny and sweet. Really enjoyed it!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it the action of kang really brings his character to mostion
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pel√≠cula me gust√≥, nuevos mundos, nuevos personajes, y escenas POSCREDITOS interesantes.  Comedia, acci√≥n, v√©anla a y saquen sus conclusiones. No se sigan por cr√≠ticos, que dicen que es mala solo porque no sale lo que ellos quieren que salga."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"this was a very fun standoff comic book movie... 
a fun adventure, can't wait to see what's next."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, i loved the way they introduced Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror. Good movie, considering the MCU and the ant Man trilogy."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn't want it to end. It's full of heart and also ominous at times. Ant-Man shows us why he's a hero. This was everything I hoped it would be. Awesome start to Phase 5!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,really had a great time watching this movie!
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good story, moderately cheesy"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,I just didn‚Äôt like it. It kinda felt like a star war movie instead of ant man from the MCU. Overall is watchable but many in the theater where I went were very disappointed. Kang didn‚Äôt convince me as a great villain I felt he was weak and anyway see the movie.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Way too much undeveloped stuff like places, people, creatures thrown right at you, without time to digest them. The new characters are undevelopped too, and if Kang will be the main villain of the MCU for quite some time, he should have had way more previous screen time for his backstory. Now his just not intimidating at all."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"When I saw the score for this movie I couldn't of been more confused. After watching it, I'm still confused on if we watched the same movie. The movie itself was a blast even with some of its clear flaws. I think this is the movie where you just need to see for yourself and not the reviews control your opinion."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I am a huge die hard Marvel fan who has seen all movies and TV series multiple times.  The newest Ant Man is one of the worst movies put out by Marvel.   Story was illogical and silly and special effects were hokey.  Modok?!... I can never unsee that.  I am worried about the future of the phase 5 and beyond.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie to start off phase 5
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Antman and the wasp quantumania is a good and entertaining film. I thought film is gonna be bad but it's a good film and it's sets up something big for the future of mcu. You gonna definitely enjoy the heck out of itü§ó. Don't believe the negative reviews.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed it! It was like Star Wars, but itty bitty. Action, comedy & heart was much more balanced than Thor: Love & Thunder, and more enjoyable! 

If you're a Marvel Comics fan, you'll love seeing Cassie live up to her potential, and seeing just how dangerous Kang is. It's a good story and setup for the Multiverse saga. The film also boasts 2 post-credit scenes people WILL be talking about!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie hurt my soul. I can't believe this is a movie
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,THE POST CREDITS ALONE OMG
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,My favorite Ant Man movie. It told a good story with laughs and big (and small) action.
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is an incredible, impressive and very beautiful movie!!! Everything is excellent, the script is excellent, the director, screenwriter, producers, composer, visual effects specialists, all the actors and the rest of the film and studio team coped superbly!!! Quantum reality is beautiful, fascinating, the study of this world is magnificent, I would like to stay there longer, immersion in IMAX 3D is incredible, the perfect beginning of the 5th phase, I can't wait for us to see and learn more what it will all lead to. All the actors played perfectly. Cassie, played by Kathryn Newton, perfectly fit into the ant-family!!! The antagonist in the person of Kang the Conqueror, as well as Jonathan Majors, who played him, were very impressed, this is really the next level, I really look forward to seeing more!!! I absolutely recommend everyone to watch this wonderful movie, and if possible, watch it in IMAX 3D, I repeat again, the movie is incredibly beautiful! I really love this movie and want to watch it again and again, I adore all these actors and the characters they play, I hope we will see them again as soon as possible! Thanks to everyone who worked on this wonderful project!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,the 3d was amazing and Kang came in to conquer
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a great movie, Paul Rudd is perfect for this role. I'm not sure why so many people are whinging, i think they are still clinging onto Phase 3 & 4 and not accepting that MCU is evolving. Loved the end credits too!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Aside from wonky CGI, exposition-heavy scenes, and has no structure--- the film was a blast with amazing performances by the entire cast, especially Majors and Pfeiffer. It sometimes felt like Star Wars but I still enjoyed the film overall."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding start to Phase 5 kang the conqueror menacing jonathan majors all over rest of the cast including antman looked like a supporting character
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So I'm not going to be down the film, but I'm going to say this, it's still giving off the same type of #MCU  type movies that we got in phase 4. I thought phase five was going to be the beginning of a bang, this was not a bang.

The movie wasn't bad, it's definitely one to watch, the critics are blowing up the end credit scenes like they are something amazing, they are not. They are just there to further the story. 

I'm not quite sure about  MODOK that CGI was extremely poorly done , like bad bad. 

That's as far as I'm going to go. But I will tell you that the movie is just here to further the story it actually has no real important parts I guess except to explain who Kang is. 

But I will go on record and say that the best part of this entire movie was Michelle Pfeiffer, the original wasp  was hands-down, the best part of this entire movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is a nice blend of humor, action, and CGI. It is a sci-fi/comic film that has family  moments and good acting. I enjoyed it."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, bad story, bad cgi, Kang is cool. 

Least its not woke. However that dosnt even matter this is more of the bad stuff post End Game. Marvel is going so down hill‚Ä¶.. Compare this to Civil war and tell me I'm wrong? This is supposed to be Ant Mans Civil war basically. However the comparison between the two is almost night and day. This is LAZY. 

 People here with 5 star reviews??? How?? Lol End Game is 5 stars. This is 1.5 stars."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Haters love to have is it cringe at some parts sure but the rest of the movie outweighs that
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,good movie left me wanting a little more but King was great
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible cgi, boring movie with boring pacing, lovely to see mcu stans alreayd overrating it on reviews before even watching the movie. That's flash > marvel 2023"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to these ""critics"". The movie is solid and fun. It's fast paced. Kang is awesome, Modok is hilarious."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Very interesting world building and conclusion to the trilogy
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,I wanted Kang to appear as a threatening or attractive villain.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"fire movie, the first iteration of kang was a great sight to see, great action, the humor was limited and placed rightly and the serious moments were not interrupted by jokes, great movie, can't wait to watch again, ant-man never disappoints."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,It‚Äôs not as bad as the critics are making out to be definitely sets up Kang as a threat .
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,horrible movie like 30 different separate plots felt like an episode of regular show ong
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"An incredible Marvel experience. The storyline was easy to follow, Kang was excellent. The Quantum realm visualized was spectacular."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Extremely entertaining.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. tried something new, but it didn't work out. Why isn't anyone trying to communicate? More than anything else, I'm not curious about the story after this at all. so disappointed."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Your average not-so-funny traditional marvel movie is here to kick off phase 5 of the MCU. For those that were hoping this movie was going to get them invested back into the MCU, you will have to keep waiting."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. I thought they did a great job
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is it an weird, oddly paced arcless movie ? Sure.
Is it boring ? Heck no. Cool visuals, although sometime a bit too dark, the movie is always entertaining. Kathryn Newton, Paul Rudd and Kathryn Newton are all really good with what they're given and overall, you won't leave disappointed. Just don't expect every single movie to be untouchable masterpieces."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, ready to see what‚Äôs next for the MCU!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great humor and action.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolut sehenswert. Sehr bunt und dynamisch. M√∂chte es ein zweites Mal sehen. Kang ist ein sehr w√ºrdiger Thanos Nachfolger. Bin auf weitere Entwicklung der Geschehnisse gespannt.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, plot moves kind of fast, but it is meant to set up the next phase of Marvel, so I'll give it that. Fun movie, fun watch, enjoyed it, you will enjoy it too."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than what the critics are saying
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"In the comics, Kang was more powerful. So the accuracy is a little off but other than that great movie. Mix between Tron and Star Wars."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Best of the 3 Ant-Man Movies very different from previous iterations!  Not sure what the Critics have watched but deff a solid Start to Phase 5 cannot wait for what's to come! Jonathan Majors knocks it out of Park!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand why the critics rated it so low as it really isn't terrible as they are letting on. It is very true to several of the Scott Lang comic book runs in terms of tone & not fully taking itself seriously in what are seemingly important moments. It is supposed to be comedic... Take a look at Scott's comics specifically Matt Fraction's FF run or Nick Spencer's The Astonishing Ant-Man run. Both deal with a bunch of serious topics for Scott such as grief & loss, but both also have a bunch of random craziness with additional humor and it works. 

Any Scott Lang comic book fan will love this film as it is a lot more similar in tone and character compared to the previous films. It feels like a comic. 

Remember, this movie is called quantuMANIA for a reason- it's supposed to feel all over the place. 

Of course there are going to be flaws, but overall it is very entertaining. People who are complaining were going to complain anyway. Like what were you expecting for an Ant-Man film?"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The people who will enjoy this movie the most are people who read the Marvel comics and ideally also enjoy Star Wars. This felt like Marvel's attempt at making a Star Wars movie with the Pym Family, and it rocks!

Also, not really getting the 'the stakes weren't high' crowd after seeing what Kang is capable of.

If you don't read the comics or follow all of Marvel's movies/shows, it's easy to see why you might think this is a 5 or 6/10 movie. You'll be confused a lot, especially during the post credits.

But for the target audience, it bangs."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang made this movie and was a BEAST
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The 3rd Antman movie left alot to be wanted from a franchise that we all thought molded its identity. 
- Jokes were ok but Michael Pena is missed
- The Quantum realm and its creation is still a mystery.
- Too many new characters have too much screen time
- Alot of bloat and useless storyline.
- This movie doesn't feel refined but instead feels like a ton tooth picks being stuck together by gum its not strong or convincing for me to believe this is going to start Kang and the new phase.
- Writing and dialouge need work.
Overall this movie didn't have enough Kang but also didn't cement him as the conqueror as I know he is. His very presence should scare the audience even when his name mentioned. This character felt incomplete."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-Man & The Wasp was an amazing and fun sci-fi adventure from start to finish packed with some fun comedy and very Star Wars meets Guardians Of The Galaxy. Johnathan Majors as Kang was very menacing and I could feel it with the scenes he was in. I loved it from start to start to finish and plan on seeing it again. The two end credit scenes are great as well. üêúüêù
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Personally, I quite liked it. Love the creativity behind all the creatures encountered in the quantum universe. One of the vilains is rather cheesy and could have been absent from the movie, but the world building leading up to upcoming events in the MCU is quite interesting! For Marvel fans 8/10 for average moviegoer maybe 7."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buena pel√≠cula con un gran Villano
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The MCU just got a whole lot bigger than what we‚Äôve see so far.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Thats rough, just abysmal dialogue and lackluster performances except Majors who wasn't used enough."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,LOVED IT!!! the reviews from so called movie critics are definitely not a reflection of the movie.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Escelente kang.. Lo mejor son las escenas post credito
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,I went in with low expectations after the trailer and critic reviews and it still underwhelmed me. I was shocked this movie had the same director of the previous 2 ant man movies. There lacked continuity on the quantum realm and i hated the world building they did. it felt like one giant star wars cantina scene. i also do not like the adult version of cassie. why didnt they include any of the x-cons? they could have at least been shown before or after they went to the quantum realm. the jokes fell flat and the effects were bad esp MODOK. Jeez was he awful. I did like Kang  though. This movie felt like filler. The mid credits scene was the only good part.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pel√≠cula predecible, llena de cgi y con un villano nuevamente desperdiciado, en cuanto a modok fue una completa decepci√≥n"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Best ant man movie ever.....don't listen to others you should give it a try...üî•üñ§
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Esperava mais do filme. Alias o personagem principal √© o homem formiga ?
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,It starts slow but Kang's introduction provides tension. He'll be an interesting problem in Phases 5 & 6. Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific. I can't help but think a Thor or Wanda cameo would have expanded this story. Very watchable but AntMan needs an ensemble to feed off of.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme muito ruim, mas por ser ruim ele √© SUPER MEGA ENGRA√áADO, um dos melhores que ja assisti em quest√£o com√©dia, n√£o as piadas, mas sim a ruindade que deixa esse filme engra√ßado"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Definitely my favorite ant man movie. There was a lot of action and the quantum realm was great. However, I just wish there was another fight scene with the main villain Kang. I also think that Cassie got a little annoying and cringe at some moments, but other than that this was a fun movie with a great villain. Paul Rudd was great as always."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really recommend it, loved the design of the quantum realm characters, lots of humour, I hate that the 'professional critics' are giving this bad reviews and just shows how out of touch they are compared to real movie fans. Ant-man Quantumania really puts Thor: Love & Thunder to shame, I'm so happy this was fun, well made and 100 times better than the last Thor (which almost put me off Marvel for good)"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't think critics saw the same movie. I thought it was a good movie. Kang is a force not to be messed with at all. The RT score should be in the upper 70s, low 80s."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was fun, and trippy, and exciting and amazing...also very brutal, something marvel has needed. The ending is more of a beginning, read into it a bit."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Even better the second time!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a fun movie. This will be a sci-fi classic someday. Jonathan Majors is amazing as Kang. Phase 5 will be awesome
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ok, better than Wakanda ‚ÄúI will never‚Äù watch it again."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Excellent acting by Majors and Rudd. But the pace is so slow and boring.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,La pel√≠cula me encant√≥ entretenida divertida con humor pero en el momento correcto. Kang y Cassie son espectaculares los que me decepcion√≥ fue Modok muy recomendada arranco bien la fase 5
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This needed a different director. I'm sorry Peyton Reed you did well with ant man 1 and 2 because they were small scale narratives but this one is the opposite of small scale and the imbalance showed.

This had to be a great one, not a decent one."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Tons of fun, action‚Ä¶ get ready for ‚Äò25"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"By far my favourite ant man film, Jonathon Majors was truly amazing."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Some movies I would like to watch again, this wasnt one of them."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just saw Quantomania and I really liked it, I don't understand where all the negativity is coming from. I feel that people don't know how to review marvel movies anymore because we all have different expectations."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Well-told storyline and plenty of action. It plays on what Ant-Man cares about the most. Closes a few loopholes left in previous movies. Overall enjoyable and creative.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"These are my ranks for all marvel movies, this movie got only to the fourth tier, same level as kinda bad marvel movies to my opinion, naturally all marvel movies are great even the bad ones.

"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, great action, great characters, some really funny moments as well as serious tones. Loved the 'Darren' character, really made me chuckle, the girl who played Cassie nailed her performance too."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was VERY FAR from the catastrophy everyone was talking about.
Kang was top-tier. Visuals were amazing. Really had a GOTG Vol 2 vibe, I just wished they'd tune up the volume of the soundtrack a bit. A bit lacking in this area.

Off to a great start for this phase 5!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Comedic Relief was awesome! And Kang was on point! Rotten tomatoes rating is way off!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing as always. no complaints.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Don‚Äôt listen to critics. Kang is sick and it‚Äôs a great way to start phase 5
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,The is good but the story line was make me boring. Are you make the boring humor? Yes.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme padr√£o, roteiro previs√≠vel, n√£o trouxe nada de novo. Jonathan e Michael Douglas roubam as cenas do filme, mas n√£o tira o protagonismo do Paul Rudd.
Nota: 5"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The humor you expect from an Ant Man movie and the action of an Abenger epic.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Ive seen this movie six times in the past 10 days.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just got out of the theaters in IMAX 3Din IL. Seeing the movie in this format was fun unlike those mean critics they probably saw it in a regular format. Kang was the standout of the film. A lot of action in the end battle sequence was cool just lacked some emotional meaning behind it since introduce us new characters, but overall a good movie direction for the new Marvel. Katherine as Cassie is absolute perfection she is babe and I loved how the core group family dynamic developed over the film. üëä"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely a repeat viewing
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Heavier tone than the other antmans. Definitely starwars vibes. Kang is a beast great movie!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Johnathan Majors killed it as Kang! He actually gave me an anxiety attack in one scene, lol."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Improved from Phase 4Nice start to Phase 5, excited to see how it develops"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors Absolutely Rocks The Role Of Kang The Conquerer. He Is About To Make Thanos His B***h!!!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Another great action-packed film!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It was an amazing movie!!Post credits was epic!!must see!
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Could‚Äôve even go bought the ticket for the wrong date
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,These films have sacrificed plot for bloat.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Antman never fails to give us entertaining movies Everytime you watch him. Marvel gave us a sci-fi Star Wars like movie that was cool to see. Great characters from minor to main characters. Kang was threatening. The bad reviews on this movie are fake. This movie is great.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a fun Marvel fare, but after hearing the hype, I was a bit underwhelmed. Regardless, I had a fun time‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs what counts. "
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great

negative: MODOK"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Can‚Äôt wait for more KANG
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Falls short of the gravity this movie was positioned to have. Boring and lacking the imagination that was hoped for.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man and Wasp: QuantuMania 
8.25/10
Jonathan carries the film to levels the MCU hasnt quite yet seen from an actor portraying a villain, until Jonathan Majors himself did it as Kang here. Which should make for an exciting Kang Dynasty, for Avengers 5."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It was funny movie. It's not bad by any means but it's certainly not making the list for top 5 marvel movies
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Finish watching it. Great fun movie.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I believed this movie just brought Marvel back from the slump they were in. Jonathon majors was INCREDIBLE as Kang. I believe in he Scott lang character is now as important in the MCU as captain America or Thor. The ""world building"" was a little ""extra"" but I felt it was definitely worth the sit through. I highly recommend going to see this multiple times"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Para ser una introducci√≥n a la fase 5 est√° bien 
Puede que M.O.D.O.K no haya Sido la gran cosa pero que importa. en qu√© parte puede caber modok en el ucm , los que se quejan de el dise√±o que lo hagan ellos Po hacer si est√°n f√°cil hacer una cabeza gigante con piernas de beb√©"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Second time seeing this movie, and it was even better than the first. Love it from start to finish! Just great entertainment, and Jonathan Majors kills as Kang"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"the film is very slow, performances are very weak with the new additions of the characters, it lacks sparkle as in the first two films and inconsistencies with the script"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I give it a 7.5/10=B+ or an 8/10=A-.Critics were way too hard on this film thor 4 was a lot worse. this is the most useful Antman I have ever seen, he was so badass, hope is in it more than I thought she was, hope is good nothing special, Cassidy is great and really interesting to see grow up and actually smart and useful, would not mind to see her again . Kang is pretty insane this movie gave us a taste of him I want more of him , the main Kang is coming I don't think he is gonna hold back. modok is pretty cool actually wasn't annoying like in the animated shows do wish we got more of him but it is what it is and he looks like modok don't know what people are making fun of he looks like his comic counter part.CGI is good but like with most movies can tell when use in certain scenes but nothing terrible the CGI is an 8.5/10 or 9/10 really good. yes, it's a setup film but that's every Antman movie, needs proof, Ant-Man 1 leads to civil war, Antman 2 leads to infinity war but more endgame. ant man 3 leed to Avengers The Kang Dynasty. marvels marking needs to be more accurate though."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is also a Kang movie sets him up as the threat.

If the first two were heist movies, the third AM&W is a road movie."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie! Great story... unfortunately, the theater cut the sound off before the post credit scenes so everyone in the theater was mad. But everyone enjoyed the movie"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Welcome Back Ant-Man.  The movie was good, I liked Paul Rudds and Jonathan Majors performances in this.  I cant wait to see the next Avengers film.  Make sure you stay to the very end of the credits."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang was great band terrifying! I had a smile on my face the entire movie. Some cringe moments and weird CGI at times. I‚Äôd definitely watch it again. Ranks as a mid to the top of the lower MCU movies for me. Still good though.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I thoroughly enjoyed it! Laughed a ton.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a GREAT MOVIE. Spectacular performance by eveyone. Can't wait to see them again!!!!  DON'T LISTEN TO CRITICS! I think critics are just straight up hating Ant-man.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don't know if I liked it because my expectations were way low because of the critics score, or maybe it's the first marvel movie I kind of enjoyed since endgame."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is visually stunning, the story is a huge build up of what's to come in the MCUs future. Still has comedy like the first two films, but is under cut by the serious tone Jonathan Majors Kang brings to the film. Don't go into the movie expecting the nostalgia build up that Doctors strange Multiverse of Madness and Spider man No way home brought into the theater. It definitely doesn't deserve the negative reviews it's getting. Go into the film with that mindset and you will love it."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a good movie, made me laugh, shows the Kang's power, and introduced a new world, i really like it, the post credit ""Awesome""."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,it was a masterpiece.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was a blast and a great start to phase 5! It had a perfect blend of humor and intense moments which allowed the serious moments in the film breathe a little. Kang was definitely a standout in the film and I can't wait to see what else Jonathan Majors brings to this role in the future. I surprisingly liked MODOK quite a lot, he was an excellent addition to this film and didn't feel out of place. The CGI was visually stunning and beautifully crafted. I definitely recommend everyone to see this film!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,loved loved loooooved it....don't know why critics hating...this is the beginning set up movie for many more to come in the phase 5 marvel....was funny like only Ant Man can bring...action...and Majors as Kang was so so gooooood...go see this movie...eye will be seeing it AGAIN sooon
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie/series of this phase so far. Dialogues sucked, but even so. Very good movie."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think it's nice in3D....I hope You enjoy it it's a 97% to Me Shantorey. 
......‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So, they made a third one of these. The first one was serviceable as a boilerplate Marvel origin story, the sequel was a complete waste of our time, and this...was an almost entirely blue-screened chore to get through. But first, let's say some positive things.

""Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania"" stepped it up a notch from the previous two entries in this series in (almost) every way, which I can appreciate. The acting hasn't gotten much better, but they're trying harder. The VFX are top-notch by Marvel standards, considering 99% of this film is computer-generated. The villain holds weight at times, mostly due to Jonathan Majors' gravitas. Lastly, this movie wasn't afraid to go FULL comic book weird with it - an aspect that I praise in every MCU entry that shows us something new.

Now for the not-so-good. This film leans very heavily on the performances of its cast, which aren't enough to overcome the overwhelming sense of irrelevance that pours out of Marvel productions these days. I have questions: Why should we actually care about this hero? This villain? Why did Cassie get recast from Endgame? This actress is boring and that character has been played by too many actors to feel realistic. 

Why does Majors poke his lips out like that so often? Were we supposed to take Rudd's ""serious face"" seriously? You don't get to joke-cast and then try to make us sympathize. Where is the chemistry in this cast? These don't feel like real couples or family members in the slightest. 

Someone could spoil every plot point in this film for you and it wouldn't impact your experience whatsoever. I laughed precisely once (the last shot before the credits), which is fewer times than in any previous Ant-Man entries. As a point of comparison, the first one had me laughing unexpectedly several times. For a series that depends on the comedy to cover its other flaws, that's a very bad sign. 

My rating is generous. I'm not watching the next season of Loki to see more Kang. The MCU needs a mercy-killing."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was very entertaining and finally gave the MCU a big bad for the hype.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Actually a lot more fun than I had hoped for. Kang was as amazing a he had to be, not a bumbling idiot.
Also refreshingly little jokes. 

And a promising start to the next phase and the next saga!

8/10, would gladly recommend and watch again"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,An exciting start to Phase 5 of the MCU! Kang is amazing.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Empty dialogues and absolutely no character development, feels like they have tried to include too much epic stuff and totally forgot about the plot itself. It seems like this movie has so much, and yet it lacks everything. Additionally, you can't tell if it is a comedy or a drama, all the dramatic moments are being ruined by stupid jokes and vice versa, feels like writers were trying to find the golden mean and failed in their attempt to do so. Kang is an amazing villain though, and overall this movie was a nice intro into the fifth phase."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was a great addition to the MCU. After what I consider a lackluster phase 4, Phase 5 starts with the stakes being amongst the highest they have been since Thanos was defeated. Best Ant Man film and a very good film to continue building this world we call the MCU."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,half a star is too high.. they massacred modok and i felt like i was watching shark boy and lava girl
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Para los que seguimos la historias de Marvel desde el principio les encantar√°, esta pel√≠cula es de Ant Man y asi se mantuvo, Kang realmente es un verdadero personaje"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"An excellent film, a good plot and a great introduction of the new villain of this new phase. The protagonists, amazing as always!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great MCU movie with great visual effects and a compelling villain.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie might have some issues especially with the effects and the humour but I enjoyed what I saw and loved the dynamic between the Lang-Pym family.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What looks like and feels like someone at Disney decided that ""people love Star Wars, let's make a Marvel movie that is a ripoff of every Star Wars movie ever"", is one of their worst movies ever. Mot the worst, but also not a great preview for this phase. 
The only ray of light in this is Majors, as he is a very good actor, but even he wasn't able to make Kang, who's going to be the main villain of this phase, feel as dark as he should, since the entire background looked so silly. 

The latest Marvel movies all feel like a setup to something that never comes. I hope this setup for the next Loki season won't affect the actual show, the best one Marvel made to date."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun film, better than Ant-Man 2. Better Audio and Visuals than Ant-Man 1 and more serious/heartfelt scenes but less funny. Amazing performance be Johnathan Majors as Kang and a great job by Michelle. No bad performances and a good debut for Kassie Lang's new actress. Promising start for Phase 5 and looking forward to the future of the MCU as Kang builds his dynasty"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There are some cool moments, and Jonathan Majors is a captivating villain, but overall it's a mess."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie best ant man yet !!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed and foreshadowing Kang. 
watch it and decide for yourself."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very fun movie w Great visuals tho the script, tone, pacing, and editing are major problems"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun ass movie. Kang gonna be a monster
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It's not as bad as they make it out to be. It had its bad moments but it is good. I liked it much more than thor crap
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you're a fan of the MCU and follow all the movies and shows. Then Ant-Man and the Wasp  Quantomania is a ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ1/2 maybe ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ movie. If you don't care about the overall story of the MCU then it's probably around ‚òÜ‚òÜ
This movie isn't made to develop the characters Ant-Man and the Wasp, it's made to introduce Kang the villain and start of a new phase of the MCU, which it does do."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"A thrilling adventure for fans of the series or MCU. Good for kids, good for parents. No fun at all for those who hate fun. One midcredit and one post credit - don‚Äôt miss them!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid movie. Definitely felt like a filler movie but was fun.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am disgusted at the score this has right now. Because the Tomato rating isn't nuanced at all, and is simply a binary, it completely misrepresents what people actually think of this movie. To most people, it is middle of the road, 6/10, pretty average, but overall okay. To me, Jonathan and Paul's performance made this movie, along with some special effects that are really good for Marvel. It is a great way to kick off Phase 5, and I hope people will still go to see it. Acting is really great, world-building great. Mainly, though, I'm giving this such a high rating to help balance out the scale."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania is the weirdest movie I've ever seen, which is saying a lot. Also one of the best movies Marvel Studios has made. Absolutely must be seen in IMAX 3D."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed it! A fun sci fi romp with some cool sequences. Not sure what the critics are seeing, sure it's not as cerebral as end game but it's a damn good super hero movie."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ever since we saw Ant Man and The Wasp battling in Endgame, here Oh My God, so after like almost 4 years since the last time we saw them, they did amaze here, and even Kang's actor did so excellent."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good start to phase 5. Really good, just not great."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought Quantumainia was way better than the reviews led me to believe. Really fun and it looks amazing. It's more of a Kang movie than an Ant-Man one, but I'm not complaining."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie is disappointing, it doesn't add anything to the Marvel universe, it's not even funny or exciting"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie for both superhero and sci-fi adventure fans.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not that bad, at least i liked it, Kang looks amazing, in fact that could be better but, this is fine."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,I loved Kang. The rest was mediocre
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors was everything. see it just for him. plot was muddled some.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"El villano nunca toma mucho valor, en esta se supone que antman crecer√≠a como personaje y el reino cu√°ntico qued√≥ a medio desarrollo"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"i was fooled by the critics before watching the film i went in full of uncertainty and left greatly entertained and excited for phase 5! the movie was fun and action packed, some parts were little bit cringe but overall it was great! better than most of the phase 4 movies! really enjoyed it!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the movie, yes cgi sometimes is not the best but i dont get why soo much hate because it was really good."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing visuals, epic action and a story full of heart!! kang is AMAZING! Paul Rudd and Michelle Pfeiffer are superb!!! And you've got to stay for these two awesome end credits scenes!! What a ride!!!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun with a good story that doesn't shy too much from time stuff, but doesn't play in it a whole lot either. Worth going to the theaters for, as most marvel movies are."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Please don‚Äôt listen to the critics. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a visual spectacle. No it‚Äôs not Avatar: The Way of Water, but the cgi isn‚Äôt horrible like everyone is letting on. The action is insane and super tense, especially the final act. I was sitting up on the edge of my seat, literally. It still has comedy but we finally get a glimpse of a serious, sometimes angry Ant-Man. The seriousness and comedy are well balanced. I literally don‚Äôt have anything negative to say about this movie. Ps. See it on the absolute BIGGEST screen you can find. 10/10."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,A high stakes yet contained movie to kick off Phase 5 of the MCU.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,What are you expecting? It's a superhero movie is not Shakespeare
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Really disappointing, the trailer seems good but the whole movie itself was far below expectations"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was thinking ""what is that? omg how cringe"" a lot of times. The best: 2nd post credits. It has 2 or 3 good moments but it's a bad movie."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cheesy lines and bad acting. Is this seriously a movie from the Marvel Universe? Like wow‚Ä¶ this is like Star Wars and Power Rangers. The graphics don't make up for the terrible plot, boring villains, and some very terrible father/daughter bonding lines.  Rating: 1.5/5"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"üëåüèª67%
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It didn't have Luis the storyteller.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,It‚Äôs a step in the right direction
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was hoping for something much more engaging for the start of Phase 5. Overwhelmed with the Green Screens usage. And the effects‚Ä¶ well Mordok looks terrible ! I mean really terrible. The only positive thing of this movie is Kang, hands down."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just finished watching Quantumania and I personally think it was great. 
It was a great setup for Phase 5 and it's an Antman movie. It's not going to be fantastic like Infinity War or Endgame but it's a great movie. M.O.D.O.K CGI was the only thing that I didn't exactly like but whatever. That won't change the fact that critics are totally wrong about this movie. Doesn't need a 50% or below. It needs at least a 70-75%. 
Go watch this movie Marvel Fans!!"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,it's okay not Thor 4 bad but not oldschool marvel good either
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,a couple nice moments do not make up for the complete lack of stakes in the action
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Marvel Sci-Fi Movie. Love it.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Personally I like this movie, but I can also see people not liking this, cause it was trying to do something different but didn't fully landed. But it's not that bad as people are making it out to be and it's a promising start for phase 5"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the whole movie
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought this movie was an atrocious mess of CGI and bad dialogue.  Only Jonathan Majors is a redeeming quality.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just awful. Worst acting and writing I've seen in a while. Overuse of CGI just to compensate the lack of ability to make this movie decent
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Terrific story line, excellent CGI, fantastic acting! Whats not to love!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Se pudo conocer mas de kang y la carga que ser√° para el futuro del UCM, en esta pel√≠cula se pudo dar m√°s desarrollo en lo que seria los personajes de Scoot, Cassie y Hope, se conoci√≥ mas a fondo el reino cu√°ntico, no hubo falla en el cgi al representar el mundo subat√≥mico, se uso mal al personaje de M.O.D.O.K, en lo que seria el cgi y en su desarrollo, los actores de kang(Jonathan Majors) y de janet(Michelle Pfeiffer) hicieron bien su trabajo y pudieron dar una buena pelicula, en redes las opiniones de la pelicula se dividen, algunos esperaban una pelicula mas seria o con una historia donde el h√©roe pierda, pero otros piden lo contrario, y no es la primera vez que pasa en las pelicula del UCM, siempre habr√°n criticas al respecto de cada pelicula, pero para mi fue un buen inicio para la fase 5."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly this movie was great for me. An average storyline with some great actions and a good ending.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme √© sensacional, visual incr√≠vel e com muita din√¢mica. Gostei de todos os personagens e acredito que abrir√° um leque de possibilidades para o Kang em sua Dinastia."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't understand the critics hate. This is a fun movie with a GREAT villain in Johnathan Majors Kang.
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,The film was okay with great characters but the writing weighs it down. I'd watch for the credit scenes alone there better than the film.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily the most fun I've had in a Marvel movie in years. Scott Lang's love for his daughter and his guilt for the time he lost with her during Infinity War is at the heart of the story. The father-daughter relationship notes were pitch-perfect throughout the movie and landed every time. The movie uses Janet's past in the most perfect way to introduce the exciting and extremely well-executed Kang the Conqueror into the MCU. While MODOK could have stood to be more psychotically volatile in order to maintain comic accuracy, he still absolutely delivered as an incredibly entertaining killing machine. Hank Pim being the force that truly turns the tide with The Freedom Fighters really brought it all home for me as well. Then to add to all of that the amazing Kang developments this film gives us moving forward, you'd have to be one petty sad sack to not have had at least a little fun in Quantumania. I'm glad this movie didn't feel like an end to a trilogy and more like the beginning of something much more expansive. I love how fun the Ant-Man movies are and can't wait to see more of the Ant-Fam in the future. Go check it out, comic book fans! You're going to have a good time."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally a good film, balanced and very smooth"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es muy buena pel√≠cula la trama esta entretenida y nos abre muchas puertas hacia el futuro de Marvel, la ejecuci√≥n de la historia y los efectos 10/10"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,We watched it first day in cinema here in Sydney and absolutely loved it. I recall it better than BP2 and Thor! I'm about the rate in RT and surprised how low critics score are... totally unreliable. You have to watch it yourself!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good the critics are being way to harsh when it comes to down to it.  It was entertaining as hell and served it's purpose to lead us into what's next to come.  Very funny and great acting.  Great visual effects it was a fantastic movie.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily best antman movie. How do these critics score these movies? Based on what criteria? These critics are a joke at times, i think they are basing the movie off of avengers infinity war and end game.. if you are, than u are in the wrong profession. A score of 50% is crazy to me. Good movie, entertaining and funny. Sure, not that action packed but they are building towards something bing in phase 5"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Wonderful movie for the franchise it is. it's not supposed to be like end game or Thor.  it's ant man a funny marvel movie with just enough action to make you say wow this was a great movie. Forget the critics who think it's was supposed to be like end game. I love the movie for what it is. Great start to phase 5.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its a movie about a guy who controls ants, fighting a guy who travels space and time.

It's not going to make a lot of sense, but it is a helluva lot of fun to watch."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful visuals, up there with Avatar! Very funny! Love Paul Rudd üôåüèª Gotta check it out "
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Strong start for phase 5, builds on family dynamics, good cinematography and World building, quite a few creative visuals and themes. And sets the scene elegantly for more."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not sure why its getting such bad critic reviews, it's not perfect but its not bad. Funny, exciting, alot of great elements, Didn't like Modok at all."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is fantastic and Kang is the true meaning of villain, go watch de movie and you will not regret that!"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"√â ruim, poucas coisas se salvam, o Kang s√≥ sabe se vangloriar dos sucessos e n√£o faz um ter√ßo do que diz, √© o famoso late mas n√£o morde, enfim, P√©ssimo filme/roteiro."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Got to go to an early showing and loved it! I felt like the mcu has been off lately but this felt great! They way Modok was adapted to the MCUs live action was brilliant storytelling. The humor was there,  I laughed throughout the movie. My wife and I have been repeating the one liners all day today. I don't agree with what the critics are saying that's for sure."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie overall, full with Star Wars references, one of the coolest CGI."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't agree with the critics. Great movie, left the theater really entertained, and it was a great start for Kang in the MCU."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good film although many weird stuff happen that don't make sense, I'd keep expectations low going to watch this one."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sadly the plot does not live up to the flashy visuals. Many well worn movie moments . Kinda flimsy premises for the film that Janet Van Dyne felt she should never talk about the quantum realm, which would have probably resulted in no one ever trying to go there!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"What did the critic's even watch. This movie was amazing and oh my god! Those post credit scenes, marvel is back!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was enjoyable. Sometimes CGI gave up, but overall a good film."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It's was pretty good. Entertaining but messy
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's better than most critics are saying.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was fun and also loved Jonathan majors. The CGI was 8/10 but still great
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,It kind of felt like a kid's fantasy...MARVEL should keep in mind that we were the audience who once were a kid now we r grown up nd we r the only loyal fans...I wouldn't say that the movie was bad or something negative but I jst want to say that MCU jst wastes such big villains like Gorr...Kang nd MODOK has been wasted...I loved he who remains more than kang...same actor different representation...so finally yeah u can go n watch it jst as anyother popcorn movie nd forget abt what ever happened in the film after leaving the theatre...it's jst another timespent movie
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great start for phase 5. Loved seeing Kang he was so good. Katheryn Newton omg i love her as cassie. Can't wait to see her again in the future. Paul rudd that guy is awesome in This movie
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is truly good! I rate it 8/10. The 49% rating that I saw here from the critics, is not representing the movie at all, maybe they watched another movie or I don't know happened... The only thing I wanted bettter is Kang, because I didn't think that he is at Thanos level... Also, some cgi needed more work... 
P.S. the 3D version of the movie is good."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"So when I saw the critics reviews it started to freak me out. How the heck, does marvel can ruin a movie about Kang and such an amazing and interesting story which had been presented in the trailers who until today, in my opinion the best marvel trailers. After seeing the movie I can surely tell you that this is an another amazing marvel movie. Sure it has few problems mainly in the third act, but those who interesting in the main marvel story, this is a mast see one. But if you come to this movie expecting another small funny ant man movie you will find yourself disappointing.
In one sentence, this movie is Star Wars meeting with marvel characters in Disney's strange world with a villain which will make you starring in the screen."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Classic Ant Man humour is back. With a good storyline push for the entire MCU. A bit too much on the action scenes which were a little unnecessary. But overall still a great film to watch. MCU is off to a good start with Phase 5.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a really nice movie, i don't understand the critics, maybe something shady is happening behind the scenes here."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie has flaws, very clear but just criticizing that is a serious mistake, it has a great performance by kang and a good family also supporting the new stages"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,loved this movie. Best entry for the ant-man movie's and best movie since end game.  Must watch for fans. For people who don't follow all the story's maybe a bit harder to understand some stuff
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Felt like a fresh start to a new multiversal mega event. Kang was amazing and showed a bit of their amazing power. However, think about it not as an Avenger level stuff, but an Ant-Man familiar adventure."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,I think they ruined many great opportunities and it wasn't as entertaining as the others.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie i loved it!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"An awesome start to phase 5 , kang is everything you can ask for"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely love the movie, it continues the two predecessors of Ant-Man perfectly. I liked the monologue of Scott in the beginning and end, the MVP was Kang and the original Wasp. I liked Darren's development. But what captivated me the most was the immersive and peculiar Microuniverse in the Quantum Realm and it's creatures, I hope to see more of that Microuniverse in the future. 8.7/10"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what everyone is talking about, this movie is really great!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jonathan Majors is an absolute unit.
Can't wait for more Kang!!!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me encanto! Excelentes efectos especiales, buenos dialogos, me facino de principio a fin! una pelicula para verla otra vez."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, it has good CGI and the acting is almost excellent. The only thing that didn't finish convincing me was M.O.D.O.K"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the movie, it could put smile on my face the entire time. I extremely loved the post-credit scenes."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I've watched it 3 times now and we'll, it's good. It's really beautiful, and I love Paul Rudd... but I dislike his new daughter and well, it feels unpolished. Plus, this version of Kang was so dry that I really was bored by him. In fact, I loved He Who Remains because of how fun he was. It made him more scary because of how silly he is but how actually powerful he is. Instead, he is just dry."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was surprisingly good . 0 politics , decent story and a lot of action . Good start for phase 5 hope it continues like that because phase 4 was a nightmare"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,La mejor de las 3 de ant man
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Unpredictable trailers. Showed too much on the trailer. Otherwise, solid start for Phase Five"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The only thing i have to cirticice about this movie is the missing of Michael Pe√±a. It wouldnt have hurt to put hin into the first or the last couple of minutes, but i do get why they didnt. They really tryed and accomplished to give Ant-Man III a more serious tone than its predecessor, to make kang look more like a serious threat. The movie it self was visually amazing, the story was captivating, the acting was great and it made me hungry for more. I dont know why there where so many negative reviews, maybe because its hip now to bash against the MCU."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,A great start to the PHASE 5
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was very entertaining with nice visual effects
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I kinda enjoyed it to be honest and I hate to see people literally trying to bury the movie, here's why those 3.5 stars"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Antman: Quantumania isn't without his flaws and is not going to be for everyone.
However i enjoyed watching this movie a lot."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good film I enjoyed it!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a lot of fun and got to the point quick. The ending was very suspenseful. Many aspects of this movie really, really shined!"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As a stand alone movie, it's great - I loved Jonathan Majors Kang, and the Freedom Fighters seemed like an awesome group of people I would love to see in another project (my favorite was Veb!). But as part of the whole MCU and the beginning of phase 5, I still don't feel it. It felt more like a Star Wars movie, than a Marvel movie."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Achei muito criativo, divertido, visualmente muito lindo e cumpriu a sua proposta!!! E n√£o tem nada a ver com Guradi√µes da Gal√°xia hahaha"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie because it was essentially marvel's star wars and I thought that was really cool, I genuinely don't think it's as bad as the critics make it out to be, form your own opinion"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"o filme √© divertido, o vil√£o √© muito bom, o universo microsc√≥pico √© bem legal a pesar de ainda ter muito a ser explorado la"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Vale la pena verla, es una pel√≠cula muy divertida y el inicio de algo muy grande, definitivamente la mejor de las 3"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a good start to Marvel phase 5. It's a fun movie , lots of actions and a snippet of what the future of the new big bad looks like."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Todo perfecto, excepto Modok.."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is pretty good for what its trying to do and a great start to phase 5
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang came to hype the fans!!  I liked the Star Wars style.  Marvel is to be congratulated!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a way to kick of phase 5, it's much better than most phase 4 movies, never did i feel like the comedy was forced and out of place like in Thor Love and Thunder, if you couldn¬¥t see where the MCU was going it has now become very clear, the quantum realm looks even better than pandora and Kang really brings it."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Arguably the worst written marvel film (or maybe that's Thor 4). Cassie's conversation with MODOK and her ‚Äòinspirational' speech are incredibly cheesy even by marvel standards. Kang is super underpowered and keeps characters alive for no reason other than for them to keep the plot moving by ruining his plans, characters save each other multiple times at the very last second, the cgi (""the volume) is super flat and lacks immersion. The ending seems to have changed last minute and is super Hollywood in the outcome. In terms of raw enjoyment I think I liked Thor better - something I thought I'd never say."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than Ant-Man 2 and Thor 4, by a long shot. I don't know what these critics are getting at. It was a fun and enjoyable film. Has its flaws but seems to have more positives than meets the eye."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"i truly enjoyed the movie , people are expecting fan service everysingle time since avengers end game or spiderman . Was a good movie in general."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched the movie already and I loved it, I thought it was amazing the wonderful look, super guy from a quantum realm. I found Scott fun but he is very mature, Cassie is a very rebellious teenager, Hope is more sensitive, Hank is less tough and I have nothing to say about Janet I loved her sweet and brutal badass I hope she appears in more other productions I still liked her and also I liked Kang he is threatening, cold and in the end I found him desperate. Modok liked it too he's pretty horrible. I liked the movie and will watch it more often with greater pleasure."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,good film. this is a perfect start of phase 5
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was pretty solid in terms of story. I did think Darren storyline was stupid and that he didn't need to be back. I also thought that Hope deserved more scenes at she was a main in the first two but kind of felt like a side character in this which is disappointing. I get the point of the movie was establishing Cassie as a future Antman in the MCU but it felt at the cost of others devolpment especially Hope's. Also I really liked the family dynamics and would of liked to see more. Like Cassie bonding with Hank and Janet in the first place and Hope and Cassie scenes. I get they have a certain amount of time to tell a good story and I think they did alright I am just saying it would of been nice. For the first time in awhile I said after a movie I'll watch it again. So that's a 4 in my books.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,this is way better than all the other movies this is a must watch!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Best MCU movie recent time. Page 5 Start now
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Visually spectacular... Loved the Ant and Wasp family... Kang didnt disappoint... Humour was toned down... Much better than Thor Love and Thunder
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"En mi humilde opini√≥n creo que es tal cu√°l una pel√≠cula de superheroes, es palomera. Creo que es una buena pel√≠cula de Marvel para iniciar con la fase 5. Jonathan Majors hace un buen trabajo como Villano o antagonista como Kang. 
Kathryn Newton la adore!!!!
Pero Creo qu√© para mi gusto est√° pel√≠cula debi√≥ haber puesto solo un Villano, ya que tenemos as√≠ es 2 villanos, que ser√≠an siendo Kang y Modok, creo que con s√≥lo la presentaci√≥n de Modok como villano en esta pel√≠cula hubiera bastado. O tan solo a kang. Aunque Kang debi√≥ ser introducci√≥n como villano en una pel√≠cula de los vengadores y solo en cameos de postcreditos. 
Hasta aqu√≠ mi humilde opini√≥n."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"A mi familia y a mi si nos gust√≥, entretenida, con el carisma de Paul Rudd. Con Michael Douglas y Pfeiffer como leyendas actuando bien. Por la idea y gui√≥n de la pel√≠cula si puede ser que tenga demasiado CGI."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una pel√≠cula llena de emoci√≥n, lo √∫nico que no me gusto fue modok, pero la peli te deja emocionado por lo que viene"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, very fun and funny to watch, This Kang needs some substant but the other variants can make it better, M. Pfeiffe has a problem acting with all that Botox in her face, but the character is very good, I think Marvel has a problem with Cassie Lang because she has the same personality as MS Marvel and Kate Bishop is like they are the same person with different abilities.  over all the movie is a good start for the new Fase, don¬¥t be scare to go and watch it, is going to be a very good time."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's fun and chaotic but defiantly relies on comic knowledge too much for a general audience to follow and not get confused
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Once again Marvel shows just how far they have fallen. I literally dozed off during the film. Kang is so so for me. Just a green screen flick with overtired and overworked special effect artists. Disney ruins all they touch.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It doesn't deserve the bad rep it's getting, it's definitely better than Thor Love and Thunder"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"AMAZING, REALLY AMAZING. THE VISUALS ARE GREAT. LOTS OF ACTION, LOT OF FUN

THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY WELL DEFINED, I HAVE SEEN IT TWICE AND I PLAN TL WATCH IT AGAIN

DO NOT TRUST HATERS, THERE IS A ANTI DISNEY, (MARVEL) AGENDA, THIS IS THE BEST ANT MAN MOVIE

PAUL, EVANGELINE, MICHAEL, MICHELLE, JONATHAN, ALL DID A GREAT JOB"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was surprisingly good . 0 politics , decent story and a lot of action . Good start for phase 5 hope it continues like that because phase 4 was a nightmare"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Estoy dudando en 3 y media o 4 estrellas, los 30 minutos son horrible y desordenados despues de eso la pelicula es una experiencia alucinante  y Kang es lo mas satisfactoria  de la pelicula tiene mucho corazon, humor y tienen sus grandes defectos pero es muy disfrutable y modok es mierda"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it was great! I do not agree with the critics.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,If you're a fan of Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and you were waiting for him to have a big fight you're going to love it.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Me and my family had a blast kang and Michelle Pfeiffer stole the show
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great super hero movie, pure essence of the comics."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The entire movie was lit! Best CGI I have ever seen, and that ending, OHHH MY *CHEF'S KISS*."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie. Better than Thor IV and the previous Ant-Mant Movies. Kang is superb.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Imaginative, fun, does not try to be anything else. I was entertained"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's not as good, as first and second movies, but I really like it."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't get what the problem with you guys is. This movie is way above average with incredible acting, solid character development and a visually outstanding alien world. On my top 5 Marvel movies and best Ant-Man and The Wasp by far."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Creo que es la mejor de la trilog√≠a
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know what movie did those weird critics watch but I think that Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania was propably even better than many movies from infinity saga and of course better than any  movie or series from fourth phase. The movie was very beautiful and I liked the humour and the action. Only thing what was a bit weird was MODOK (that's why half a star away) but it propably was suposed to. I also really liked Kang and the idea that we cannot know what is gonna happen bc there is endless possibilities how everything can end.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"All I can say was, this was so mind blowing! Ant-Man definitely took a dark/serious turn, and critics hate that, but it definitely is a good change of mood. The first two was light-hearted comedy and dealt with standard villains, now we're dealing with Kang (the ultimate villain of this saga) so of course it's a big transition from light to dark and brooding. The stakes are definitely high, and we're dealing with something more dangerous!"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The critics are forcing themselves to find bad things to say and while some of them are true most of them are completely wrong.
Most of the time the cgi is incredible (m.o.d.o.k is a hard watch but thats it)
And it makes the quantum realm look absolutely fantastic.
The plot moves in a weird pace but it is not too bad in my opinion.
The quantum realm has no logic whatsoever and I wish they had explained better in the movie.
The movie great acting especially from Jonathan majors who makes Kang a true villian.
All things considered it is a good movie with flaws and it surpasses both antman movies prior to it, it does not deserve to be rated 50% whatsoever."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't believe the haters. This is a fun. Weird. Wonderful. Funny. Epic. Action packed adventure. Maybe the best of the phase so far. Taking cues from Star Wars, black panther and even a touch of Thor ragnarok and love & thunder. Don't over think it. Just strap in and enjoy it."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bastante gen√©rica, con muy mal CGI efectos mediocres y una historia muy forzada. En lo personal no me dejo buen sabor, creo que Marvel est√° agotando ideas , ya no se preocupan por dar pel√≠culas de calidad. No dudo que para pasar el rato cumple , pero no veo a donde vamos a llegar con pel√≠culas c√≥mo est√° que cada vez caen mas.
What happen to Marvel ???  CGI is so cheap, not funny, not interesting., boring movie. It's so sad for the fans that used to love this movies."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really weird movie but a satisfactory one nonetheless. Loved many support characters and the charisma that Paul Rudd brings is undeniable. A certain character was completely destroyed but hey, Kang is everything I wanted."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel, you used to be better. I still hope you get back to your Phase 3 shape."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"excellent film, although this is not the best, and like many others it has a plot hole, it is entertaining and tries to be faithful to the concepts of Marvel comics"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I went expecting a completely boring and frankly bad movie after I saw those critic's reviews and was pleasantly surprised tbh. The movie isn't without its issues but it's an entertaining watch. Kang stole the show, kudos to Jonathan Majors on his portrayal."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great movie better then the 2nd one but couldn't live up to the first Ant-Man. Nobody listen to the critics! They don't know anything about marvel! Oscar award nomination for Jonathan Majors in my opinion
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Ant-Man movie yet!
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie is not perfect or visually spectacular but it is enjoyable .As always Paul Rudd was perfect as Ant-Man.Plot of the Movie suffer little bit as it has to introduce the Next Big bad of MCU and kick off a new phase. You will not be bored for a minute .CGI is inconsistent in somplace but overall it was good .A good start for Phase 5 .Jonathan Majors as Kang stole the movie, that guy got a range. He played Kang in Quantumania and He who Remains in Loki completely differently can't wait for what is coming in the future of MCU. Kang Dynasty is going to be banger. 
6.5/10"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantumania is a fun family ride. It clearly means to introduce what Kang represents and it did it perfectly. I consider it a simple awesome adventure and pure entertainment.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, Majors steals the movie with an incredible performance. The characters, the plot, the effects and the whole world created were spectacular. Given, MODOK could have been better in terms of concept and effects, but it didnt ruin the movie for me. One of the best Marvel movies so far and a great start for Phase 5!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are weird. Awesome movie! Pure distilled Marvel. Funny, touching, a lot of action, a gorgeous cgi world. Loved it! Go see it."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a really well-balanced movie; with great action and effects, a sense of adventure, good humor without being over the top (like the latest Thor), a really interesting story, unique characters, and it has a good resolution. I'm not sure why the 'pro' critics hated it so much but it's cool now to hate on everything marvel I guess."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,It dosen't really deserve the 50 rating maybe a 75
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just finished the first Show! It's 3:05am , I feel excited and never want to go to sleep. So firstly, it's not a movie like Captain America with a lot of action pictures, it is always that all family could watch it together; Secondly, I feel more agree with Cassie Lang that we never should avoid it even it never happened to us, I didn't remember exactly what she said, but more or less she meant something like that, I feel I never be alone, that's where I angry from,that's where justice come from; Thirdly, it really bring Kang to us, I could understand what he said or did , maybe it relevant with I have already watched a bunch background introduction with him , it will not that clear for some one who never saw the comics?! 
Whatever, I like it ! 
And this movie keeps the Marvel's tradition.
So two more surprises !"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"What were the critics smoking? It was easily the best antman film out of 3, i gave it 9/10"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I made an account just to make this review...
You might as well just rename this movie to Cassie and The Wasp : Quantumania.
Antman was barely there, Paul Rudd was barely there. And when he's on screen, it's either as a supporting character or being saved by others.
Antman, an engineer asking dumb question and acting dumb is just bewildering."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as what the critics say.
I absolutely loved some scenes, some scenes were absolute torture. Jonathan Majors executed his role perfectly as Kang. Would recommend to see this. Just don't expect a groundbreaking amazing film."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly the best movie out of the Ant-man trilogy. Kang was amazingly portrayed despite being sort of nerfed, however this just shows that further and stronger versions of Kang will appear later in the MCU. The humor was on point, loved the vibe of the movie and honestly would watch it again. Overall, I think it is a pretty good start to phase 5 and a great link to the second season of Loki."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie A LOT. This is definitely the best Ant-Man movie, im my opinion. The villain, Kang, WOW, he was amazing, thanks to the actor (Jonathan Majors). I‚Äòm glad they introduced this variant in an Ant-Man film. I can‚Äòt wait to watch more of him in other projects‚Ä¶, Scott Lang as usual doesn‚Äòt disappoint and I was also really happy that Michelle Pfeiffer got more to do in this movie‚Ä¶, the action was good and I also really enjoyed the family dynamics in the movie. Overall, definitely one of the better MCU movies."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really don't understand why the critics are being such a pain in the *** with this movie. It is a really good classic marvel movie. 

Thanos who?! Kang is absolutely astonishing!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"While this movie isn't perfect there's lots of things it stays true to. The writers had a difficult time finding the balance between an OP character like Kang and a mostly comedic character like Ant-Man but I think for the most of it they actually achieved it. The movie suffers from lacklustre motivations around why Janet didn't ""explain"" the entire civilisations and even why she still cagey once they arrive and if this troupe hadn't been widely over-used in other movies the payoff once she explains perhaps would've had more gravitas as the movie does a great job explaining her relationship to but not so much to everything else. Many criticise MODOK in this however the choice to make him who he is actually strengthen's Cassie's arch, and the choices to break up his moments for mostly comedic relief also is consistent with his character and doesn't leave us with another OP character in the movie. The critiscism that this movie is ""too serious"" is unfair especially considering Paul Rudd does so well bringing levity to the first half of the movie, and there is just so much ""humour in light of the darkness"" moments that maybe other critics are taking many of the scenes far too seriously. Overall, it's well worth the price of the ticket and worthy of launching Phase 5. It's also got hands down the best post credits scenes that any MCU film has had in at least the last 4 years."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Phase 5 movie. Calling it now.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una gran pel√≠cula para disfrutar si eres fan de Marvel, gran actuaci√≥n de Jonathan Majors como Kang, te deja con ganas de saber que es lo que viene a continuaci√≥n."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I like Marvel, I like Paul Rudd and his style, and I have liked the AntMan character in MU movies. But this movie was very disappointing. Story line was weak and poorly thought out, disjointed ideas were tossed out there for no apparent reason, nothing really held together, it was not believable or consistent even within itself, Paul Rudd was mechanical in his performance, the ‚Äúall-star‚Äù cast appeared to be mailing it in and just looking for one last pay day. The beginning was bad, the middle was worse, and the end was way too formulaic and poorly executed. DFX were very well executed, but not believable not consistent. They WAY too obviously set it up for a sequel at the end, and all I can say is ‚Ä¶ please, god, don‚Äôt. "
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Sicuramente non √® un'opera d'arte, ma senza dubbio il migliore dalla fine della saga dell'infinito. Non ha il budget di Avatar e si vede, ma la storia √® semplice come quella, ma serve ad entrare finalmente nel multiverso e sbloccare la narrazione. Modok inguardabile, proprio fatto con i piedi, certe cose le potevano evitare ma comunque c'√® un minimo di racconto finalmente, ed √® quello che mancava. Forse un po' troppo comico ma comunque positivo. Non mi ha fatto schifo quanto avatar e Thor, love and thunder. Questo lo riguarderei, gli altri due mai pi√π nella vita."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Antman stays king of marvel movies. A bit trope filled at parts and some shots I'm sure I've seen before in a star wars movie (-.5 stars) and no Luis or any of the other ex cons (-.5)
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente pel√≠cula, muy divertida üôå la pelea de Scott contra kang y la entrada de las hormigas 100/10"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think it's a good start of phase 5, Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd nailed this movie. Everyone should go see it."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a good movie, there's some problems with the writing in some dialogs and some characters not well developed but as a whole the movie is enjoyable and good"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quantumania is a film that explores several new concepts and has a great 80's style adventure. In addition, it shows a little bit of a great villain, majestically played by Jonathan Majors."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I honestly don't understand how the critics prefer Love and Thunder over this, but at the end of the day, quantumania is a funny and entertaining story that family give us some clarity about the future of the mcu."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was honestly the best movie I have ever seen.  All of the characters were so well developed and the entire movie just had fantastic acting and scriptwriting.  To be honest, the only character that didn't do amazing was Kang.  Jonathan Majors was not the right pick for this role. I can't wait to look back on this movie in a few decades and consider this one of the all-time classics."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Such a disappointment. C'mon Marvel, entertain us!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,IT IS FANTASTIC! MARVELous!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"√â um √≥timo filme. Um dos melhores da Marvel, colocaria no top 10.
N√£o sei porque t√£o pegando t√£o pesado com o filme, esse povo elogiou Wakanda Forever e Multiverso da Loucura que s√£o horr√≠veis.
Acho que est√£o surpresos com um filme de super her√≥i raiz, deve te acontecido o mesmo com Ad√£o Negro que tamb√©m √© um √≥timo filme."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ain't that bad as the critics rating. Personally I like it more than Thor: Love & Thunder with its overindulgent tone. Way better than Eternals.

While keeping the storylime simple, I feel that Antman should be watched as its own franchise rather than having a high expectations of the whole MCU's promised multiversal saga. Then it would be nice and enjoyable session themed around family. Could have been better, but alas, at the end of the day, it did bring the feel good moment.

Of which I did not feel a thing in Eternals. 
The show overall should at least be in the mid rankings of MCU movies."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It actually deserves maybe 4 stars but I wanted to spite the stupid reviewers who bomb a movie just because it has the name marvel on it. This jealousy of Marvel's success is getting out of hand. It's a good movie. Kang is amazing and it's exactly what everyone was asking for, a good marvel villain. Although the real villains here are the marvel fandom that expect every film to be exactly like they want it to and get sore and cry over any deviation from the regular. Marvel is wonderful, the movie is solid, Rotten Tomatoes just has some whiney childish reviewers."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Se n√£o fosse o Kang, eu daria 1"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It is fantastic although some shots are unclear. But I enjoyed it very much!!!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Marvel has a serious problem with hiring dogshit writers with no understanding or care for actual Marvel characters and comics like fans do, but Quantumania is still a fun enough story to have a great time. I had a great time in Quantumania; just don't think too hard about the poor understanding of characters and just let yourself enjoy the film for what they were crafted into instead of what you expect of them."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I very good movie to star phase 5 !
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a great start for the 5th phase and starts something great. Loved Kang and liked the way that it was something personal for Scott to be in the critical situation he is
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Ms Newton is a star! 
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The fake critics online piggy back off each other's thoughts. They say it's copying Star Wars and I guess they never saw Guardians. The fan vote is the only accurate one
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don‚Äòt understand the negativity, I enjoyed the movie. Beautiful story, stunning visuals, funny and entertaining. A promising start for phase 5."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,All the movie has action and the characters are great. Kang is awesome really want to see more of him soon. Excellent movie.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie,  funny, moving, powerful and Marvel has an incredible new and terrifying villain in Kang played expertly by Jonathan Majors,  top 10 Marvel sequel!"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The film is good at setting up the future of the MCU. There are a few good moments. The film introduces Kang and his power in the multiverse but Majors's performance may seem that he is trying too hard to become Kang at times that it felt flat. Comedy and actions are there but it's not ""Avengers"" movie-like. The problem is with the character's arc other than the characters of Paul Rudd Ant-Man, Kang, Janet, and Cassie was not touched on very much. Especially Hope's scenes were very minimal and Evangeline Lily's character was not used enough in this movie. This might be the best Ant-Man in terms of scale, it might not be the best MCU movie but certainly not the worst."

"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Yet another movie that felt like an Avengers sequel. Dull and really uninteresting to watch. Feels like a heavily scripted plot that makes it unnatural and unrelatable to the viewers. Can't we just focus on the characters that the movies are 'supposedly' about instead forcing viewers to digest the entire MULTIVERSE at a time? At this point, DC has more compelling movies to watch."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics who thought this movie was horrible, are absolutely wrong. Don't listen to those critics because they gave a 100% to She Hulk and Love And Thunder, Quantumania was a great introduction of Kang The Conqueror to the MCU and as the next big bad villain for the Avengers, Jonathan Majors played Kang perfectly and the father-daughter relationship between Scott and Cassie Lang shows the audience how special Cassie is to Scott that he is willing to go one on one with Kang to save her. 
This movie is a 10/10 for me. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS! See it for yourself!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Simplesmente magnifico do come√ßo ao fim. Humour a dose certa e a√ß√£o fora do normal!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly don't understand the critics. Loved the visuals, the world they created, the acting was great and so was the story. Compared to other 2-hour movies, this one didn't feel like a long movie at all. Just shows again - always form your own opinion! 5/5"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow! With this movie and Wakanda Forever Marvel is back again!!!!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. The dynamic of the Lang/Pym/van Dyne family was fantastic. Scott and Hope have become a strong romantic couple as well as a strong team who know each other's every move. The scenes between Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors contain some of the best acting I‚Äòve seen in a long time. A family movie about family I can thoroughly recommend!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great start of Phase 5
Very good movie"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun movie, good pacing, likeable characters and exciting action pieces. The plot doesnt make a lot of sense, but the premise kinda justifies it. Overall one of the more entertaining entries in phase 4 MCU."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was an amazing sci fi movie, wanna check whats next on mcu phase 5"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good start of phase 5. Good action and great characters. Atmosphere is darker than the former Ant-mans but we still enjoyed it a lot. And yes, Kang is great! Can't wait for what's up next (looking forward especially to 'The Marvels' as we are big fans of Cap. Marvel)"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's an amazing movie an a good start to the multiverse saga, meeting better our new villain: Kang, This is not a movie with a lot of heroes like other movies of marvel, but it have a good trama to introducing Kang to the fans :)"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"As usual Marvel deliver, a massive blockbuster in a small quantum universe.. I went into this movie wanting to see an Ant-Man movie and that what I got, the Ant-Man humour led by Paul Rudd and the relentless powerhouse that was Jonathan Majors, im buzzing to see more of him in the MCU and Loki.  

Evangeline Lily was great as Hope, and Kathryn Newton is fantastic as Cassie Lang, I can see her being in the MCU for a long time.

All in if you're going to watch Ant-Man then you know what to expect, the ""Professional reviewers"" giving it a bad review becuse they're to pretentious to say they enjoyed it! Ignore them it's great"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was an absolute banger start to phase 5. Kang as you all might have guesses carried the movie but it still managed to succeeded to focus on Scott, hope, cassie, hank, and hope as well. The ending really makes you want to watch the post credit scene which explains exactly what happened. (You really need to watch both post credit scenes). Overall, an incredible movie! 8.5/10"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme √© INCR√çVEL!!! Assistam no cinema, √© uma experi√™ncia maravilhosa."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rotten Tomatoes is a page for some critics got paid under the table to criticize Marvel and DC movies. I understand that all movies aren't great. But must of the Hollywood industry and directors don't like Marvel and DC. The movie for me is great, a good introduction about Kang and different variants. To continue the Saga, like the comics."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely shocked by the negative reviews. This is one of the best MCU movies and it's everything I wanted phase 4 to be. Excited again for the MCU.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fue una pel√≠cula loca, de inicio a fin, sinceramente de parte de Antman se sinti√≥ algo d√©bil o floja, pero lo que hace que me guste la pel√≠cula ser√≠a Kang el conquistador!
En verdad nos ense√±aron lo peligroso que llegara a ser en MCU!"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,the best phase 5 movies so far
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"What makes a movie great? Is the genre considered, the production design, directing, acting, writing, and overall feeling from a supporter who appreciates the consistency/depth/great emotional tug of said movie/product? For this third outing of the Ant-Man (and the Wasp) franchise, and Marvel Studios production number...uh...37? Anyway, simply, the best. Well done All Things Considered, you have done it yet again! (Hey K.E.V.I.N. my only two complaints remain: give us ""Hidden Chapters"" to fully flesh out Thor: The Dark World, Eternals, What happened with Maximoff between WandaVision and Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness, and...more Moon Knight! And continue to employ/encourage/and edify a variety of artists!)"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a load of fun! First act it cut up weird but does great and making you just want to see Kang. Once you get that this movie is GO GO GO! 2 of the greatest post credit scenes ever IMO. Definitely a fun movie on its own and gets you ready for what's to come.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,O filme √© muito bom. Nao liguem pra nota baixa dos cr√≠ticos e os Dcnautas d√£o . Assistam e tenham a pr√≥pria opini√£o.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,I am so excited t watch this movie and I think every MCU fans to watch it.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is an amazing way to start Marvel's phase 5, jonathan majors stole the show, the cgi was outstanding. Ignore the critics!"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than the first and second ones, easily. A bit overwhelming at times plot-wise, but it's a fun time."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Most of you guys says it is not a deserved end for ant mans triology, i get what you mean but it is a start of the multiversal saga, and the first act was very likeable for those who loved the first 2 ant man movie , kang was very good but i dont think this was his character on 100% , hopefully the post credits can live up to this"
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So this Ant-man film is for my part the best of the 3, but I find it not up to the task of introducing Kang and a phase V like this. Jonathan Majors is an actor who took my breath away, Paul Rudd was very good and Michelle Pfeiffer is very present. However Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas are borderline absent and I find that very unfortunate. MODOK is filthy. Special effects very good except certain. There are facilities in the scripts that pissed me off. And the post-credits scenes are the best."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Must watch The movie. The new beginning of a Dynasty
And A good marvel movie after a long time 
Love you Ant Man üíü

And Thank You SpidermanüòÇ"
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think that Kang's character is the only one who deserves a good evaluation, apart from the illogical ending"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,I really like it .It is different from other MCU movies
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the low review, this movie is actually good. It's action packed!  There was no dull moments, I love every second of it. There was no opportunity for me to look at my phone."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is good enough to kick start the multiverse saga
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Still in the cinema lobby.

THIS. WAS. EPIC !!!

Anybody not going into cinema missing out, y'all want a comic super hero movie and beyond ? Go watch this.

All the ones saying marvel Star Wars is saying the same about avatar and dune I guess. Experts üòÇ

AND YOOOOO THE END CREDITS DUDE üòÆüòÆüòÆ"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Three words. KANG KANG KANG. One of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen. A nice balance of comedy and serious moments unlike love and thunder. Loved Reed's protrayal of MODOK.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great start to Phase 5 of MCU the movie was an 8.5/10 for me as a marvel fan as a comic fan they did great with it
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. The Critics are jealous that they don't have the amazing body that Kang has.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some critics were right when they said that the movie felt a lot like Star Wars. The fact that the people in the Quantum realm¬†finally don't speak English is also a nice touch. The screenwriter explained this in a unique way, which made many people wonder for a long time why the mystery of aliens speaking English is not in this movie. Things should make more sense.
The art team did a good job with how the characters look. But to put it simply, the layout is a lot like that of Thor, but Peyton Reed's plans are pretty good. And the jokes are finally back to what they used to be and can really make you laugh (unlike Taika Waititi that forces you to laugh but is not funny).
For a part of¬†the trilogy, this movie is up to the standard. I don't know why the first and second episodes got good ratings but this movie got such a bad one. Even though it is also a Marvel movie, this one is about Antman and not the Avengers. It's not really fair to judge this movie by the same standards as Avengers. After all, Avengers costs differently, takes different amounts of time to make, and has a different cast.

If we keep using the same standard¬†to judge movies after Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, I don't think we'll see another Marvel movie for another 5‚Äì10 years. But just because you wait a long time doesn't mean the quality will be good. Avatar has a picture that can't be beat indeed, but the story doesn't make it worth going to the theater. I don't know why Cameron made Titanic, which was such a good movie, but his other films just don't measure up. Speaking of which, Antman 3 is doing pretty well, and as the first movie in Phase 5, it really made me wonder what would come next."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not as great as previous MCU movies. I think the bar was set high on that one. But definitely a must watch for any Marvel fan.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,these morons give low ratings of this movie. Go read comics what about that?
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a new beginning and what a way to start with a superhero we would not expect to fight against Kang. People forget what Marvel it's all about and just focus on CGI apparently, the first 2 movies they gave them bad reviews because they were too comedic, now we got something serious and all of a suden We miss the Comedy factor. Great movie to start phase 5, a must watch!"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una gran pel√≠cula , con un buen cgi y una historia entretenida. Tambi√©n debo destacar la participaci√≥n de Jonathan Mayors como Kang . Este comienzo planta las bases de la Fae5   que llevar√° a algo m√°s grande y multiversal."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kang is a thrilling new foe that kinda is more in the tone of Loki and Thanos fused. cunning but threatening.

The movie once again is on the funnier side but not goofy like Thor Love and Thunder was.

The ending sure is disappointing though"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Great start for Phase 5!
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Why so negative reviews from everywhere ?
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Best marvel film since endgame. Great start to phase 5
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Early story good, mid story - end story poor execution bad fighting coreo"
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Best Star Wars film since Revenge of the Sith. Coruscant has never looked so vibrant, and it was great to see so much xenos representation after the human-washing of Andor.

Jonathan Majors did a fantastic job as Darth Kang üëå"
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Epic movie.
Welcome back MCU!!!"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Kang is a best villain
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Its a big movie with a great villain and fun family aspects. The story isn't perfect.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme tem suas falhas, √© √≥bvio, mas √© um filme divertido, engra√ßado e s√©rio ao mesmo tempo e inicia a fase 5 com certa maestria."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"it's amazing, majors really doing his jobs and kang i'll wait u in the next movie"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"People don't like it, because they expected to much. They wanted endgame level.
Go into it like an antman film, a heist movie. Jonathan Majors steals the show and go into this like a part one."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Marvel is back with a bang! Epic way to start phase 5, humor was just right and not forced, Kang is amazing and Antman is great."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Ant-Man"" isn't an example of bad comedy. It's bad drama, bad science fiction, and a waste of everyone in it, including Evangeline Lily and Michael Douglas."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just another formulaic superhero movie. What a waste of everyone in the movie
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a terrible movie, total disappointment! People have been praising Kang but even he is bad. Just less bad in comparison to the rest of the shit in this film."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An awful movie that fumbles on even the most basic elements needed to be good, unsurprisingly bad movie that resembles the rest of Phase 4's biggest flaws"
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The plotline only consists fighting, fighting, fighting. It was boring. Too much action I couldn't breathe. Guess they tried to balance it with humor, but I didn't laugh."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"it was better than black panther..
but that's all"
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Phase 5 starts with the bang Ant-Man remains nice and Kang is fantastic the only problem they kept aside Hop and Modok is done very badly but it was done to keep him faithful you have comics so I appreciated the effort
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,really good loved ant man kang and m.o.d.o.k
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"N√£o foi tudo isso que eu esperava, mais n√£o √© ruim √© um filme bom."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A true movie, for sure the best MCU film since Wakanda forever, and by far the greatest thing  so far in phase 5! Jonathan Majors IS Kang and you're going to want to watch this on a screen. Marvel has done it again"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*

Ant-man and the wasp kick off phase 5 with an insanely fun start!!

This movie will be another example of what the critics will dislike but the audience will love! Story wise there's actually not much to spoil, but had an interesting insight on what to expect more from the multiverse saga and the gravity of the situation that's brewing. The action was an insane amount of fun kinda like marvel meets Star Wars! the cast were great, I was worried how MODOK was gonna be handled but was left satisfied. Above all else Majors as Kang was awesome! While this movie has a lot of funny moments he'd change the vibe entirely,  definitely looking forward to his future in the mcu.

Overall while it didn't mount it to some expectations and came across cheesy at some points, I thinks it's a great start to phase 5 and easily my top favourite Ant-Man and the Wasp movie!"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of the best MCU films by far. It has a perfect balance of action, comedy, and eerie scenes with Kang. This is a must watch and has brought back my hope for the future of Marvel. It's a perfect way to set up Phase 5."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It really a good movie and star wars and marvel two different
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is still confusing
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, Great Villain, must watch as MCU fans."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best entry for a phase five 
Kang it kills"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"A really enjoyable movie from start to finish, a good introduction to Kang the Conqueror"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Epic movies, bring us to open phase 5‚Ä¶ Jonathan Majors is awesome !"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not the best Marvel film, but not the worst. Everyone complaining about the overkill of CGI, but it's the quantum realm, it's not like anything on Earth. 
Paul Rudd was great as Ant-man. 
And Johnathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror was amazing! Him against the Avengers is going to be epic! 
4****"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie!
Beautiful, fun and a great story!!!!"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed it, and good links to future movies or shows."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! Ant-man vs Kang is so amazing. Phase 5 going to be lit.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer were both incredible. A fun and emotionally driven movie with plenty of laughs and action. The quantum realm was beautiful.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie great. No great reviewers
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good movie, Kang absolutely stole the show especially. Somewhat missed the light hearted tone of the first 2 Ant Man films but this is at least decisively going for something else"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"the visual, the story, development character are on point.."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie feels like a contextual vehicle for Kang the Conquerer. Has some funny moments and heart. Nothing mind blowing. Post credits are cool.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome start to phase 5
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,For a movie that was meant to set up phase 5 of the mcu and get me excited for what is to come I am now more concerned and unenthused for what is to come. The movie attempted to explain the multiverse and foreshadow the Kang Dynasty that was initially set up in Loki but I think most people will be left more confused after watching quantum mania. To me there is a severe lack of communication between writers at marvel in connecting the overarching storyline moving forward and each new movie that comes out appears to be just throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. The mcu at present feels more like a parody of its former self and there are a few scenes in the movie where my friend and I literally laughed out loud at how bad some of the scenes were. After watching this movie I can appreciate Scorsese's criticism of the comic book genre as this movie used every single super hero trope imaginable and executed all of them horribly. I hope the mcu can return to form however I'm not holding my breath.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie very much.! I can't understand the bad comments if to be honest 
Great beginning to phase 5 and fantastic introduction to Kang"
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ant-man 3 is a decent movie, 4th best post-endgame movie (after Shang-chi and Both Spider-man). While the plot lacks some depth, the action in this movie makes up for it, as well as Kang. Modok is fine, however incredibly wasted in this movie. The jokes are usually pretty good and Post-Credits scenes are mid (First one would be better if the makeup department could do their job well and second is probaly a clip from an upcoming project). This movie is comparable to Black Adam. 7.5/10"
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good stuff. Could have been great. A LOT is going on in the film...much of it works.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was so good. the action, the visuals, the humour was perfect. MODOK is weird, but he is comic accurate."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great way to kick off phase 5! I'm no movie critic with blah blah blah about movie structure, I'm just a guy who enjoyed this movie a lot."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely phenomenal movie, cgi was perfect, the storyline was okay, Jonathan Majors (Kang) stole the show, don't listen to the critics!"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Though critics had a given this movie a bad review but this movie was not bad at all,Kang was menacing in the movie as Jonathan Majors carries the movie,The chemical between scott and Cassie continues to be great and the humour is a lot tame compared to thor lat.Overall you should watch this movie and form your own opinion"
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,The reasonable run time and the stand-out portrayal of Kang the Conqueror by the excellent Jonathan Majors ultimately did not save this film from becoming another 'meh' entry in the messy slate that is the current MCU.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just walked out of one of the first screenings in New Zealand, the movie was flippen epic!!! 

Paul Rudd as usual kills it as Antman! Jonathan Majors acting as Kang is beyond this world, it's like he was born to play Kang. Michael Douglas was class ehuch isnt a surprise and there were a few new characters who played amazing parts! The reason it isn't a 10 is because I thought Kathryn Newton should not have played Cassie, they should have kept Emma Fuhrmann. Newtons acting was meh at best. 

This is honestly a must watch for every true Marvel fan, best thing they've pumped out in a long time and I'd arguably put it in my top five marvel movies of all time! The hate this is receiving I don't understand,  the jokes hit, the visuals were class, the story was awesome, the future looks amazing and it's a good stepping stone towards a bigger universe! 

Just remember 
Always look out for the little guy"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love it. Best marvel movie in
Years. Can't believe we got his in 2023. Thank god for the ants!"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,The best marvel movie post endgame! Kang is amazing
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a fun movie and a visual spectacle. It's sad that the critic views are given importance while audience are the one who genuinely enjoy it. Must watch movie.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"The smallest superheroes have starred in their grandest movie to date, marking the official start of Phase 5 and the Kang Dynasty in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Phase 5 picks up where phase 4 finished. Utter garbage again. It's quickly looking like Disney is doing to marvel what it did to star wars.

Some sprouts of comedy but otherwise horrible cgi, horrible action, horrible cgi and boy does our new super villain leave much to be desired. #bringbackthanos"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan majors is easily one of the greatest actors of all time movie starts off a tiny bit slows but when kang is introduced it turns fantastic
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania 

Looks like phase 5 is going to start of much like how phase 4 did...very poorly, which is a shame because I loved the first Ant-Man movie and the sequel, but this third outing feels like it took 3 different types of movies and stuck them together. I dare say I enjoyed the first act of the film, the 2nds act absolutely dipped in quality and performance and the 3rd and final act.....smh just went absolutely bat crazy and overdone with with CGI. I thought Aquaman's 3rd act was all over the place in what was going on but this was another level of ""what the heck is going on"".

I also notice they are trying to being the back the shaking cam combat....please dont, it was rubbish to watch then and still is now.

Personally I am not a fan of the third film, it started off strong but then like most the MCU films since phase 4 the quality just vanishes into its reliance on comedy which I am sorry to say is just past its time now."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kang is not strong and intimidating enough to be the next villain after Thanos. Story is kinda boring. Cg looks fine. Overall I think they could bring more out of it.
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's not bad bad but it really was a bad start to phase 5 the visual effects and cgi looked awful the story was messy kang was no threat at all, your telling he's the big bad of marvel, can't spoil it but you'll see why he's no menace at all in this film. Best parts of the film is the end credits scenes which are great"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really great. Love kang, best antman movie."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is great don't listen to critics they doesn't know anything about comics kang is a beast
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great, a really fun time and Jonathan Majors is superb, just like in Loki. The 2 hours flew by and it could have been longer."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall I enjoyed this movie a lot. A spin on the Ant-man franchise and for me was a hit! Some elements don't quite work. But those are minimal, and I didn't leave the cinema effected negatively by them in any way. Scale is big acting was impressive! Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Be your own critic. I loved this."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. Critics are weird man.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know why critics gave it 53% obviously they aren't marvel fans. But this is gonna be a good film
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Couldve and shouldve been better. Grandiose epic adventure doesnt fit Antman and this film is a proof of it. Kang was good though. The story(if you can call it that) is very lacklustre. Didnt like it but had fun at times. Just the definition of mediocre.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Certainly the best movie of the phase so far, this is the kind of marvel movies we used to watch in the infinity saga"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant man 3 is a good movie easily better than Thor 4 and Doctor strange 2 and it's easily the best out of the 3 ant man movies idk what the critics are smoking
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything is so much better if u compare it with the latest phase 4 movies (bp:WA and thor 4)... But I feel kinda not into cassey act and I think it's great movie to enjoy
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was so good. The humor, the action, the visuals everything was perfect. Its a new favorite for me and will definitely see it a few more times in theater."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyble..
Good start for phase 5"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,A spectacular blast of a film with vibrant characters and a menacing villain
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"its nice introducing quantum realm & kang the conqueror ""just wait until you meet kang variants"" üôâüêú

i love cassie lang too, i love you peanut! ü•∞"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is really good. The quantum realm looks amazing and Kang rules in every scenes. There are a lot of things that are introduced that will be fundamental for the Kang Dynasty movie. And the two post credits.. Wow, I'm hyped!"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"though I thought Cassie's actor's acting was meh, I thought the rest did  great job and it was a really good movie, never listen to the critics"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great, kang steals the show"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,No digo que es muyy buena con endgame pero creo que es un buen comienzo de la fase 5 y lo que isieron mal y usar mal a los personajes secundarios como MODOK
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie i personally recommend mcu fans that truely understand that this is an antman film should not come into this movie expecting endgame level when it is a solo movie. i think there was so many high expectations for this movie to be endgame level because it had lane the conqueror in it. this was to introduce fans what is to come in the future while also being an antman story, but showing us viewers that woah hold on this isn't just no thief type threat this is avengers threat. i thought was done superb. however i thought the cgi and effects for this film was too much for an antman movie, as you know by now wit of the scenes where not we'll worked on because too many other focuses. but that is absolutely avoidable by pauls charm while posing a threat with very well done acting by jonathan majors. hun our was decent but this entry was so far better than previous of mcu films. it is worth your time"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"in terms of the visuals, it's great and beautiful, kang the conqueror is the best comic adaptation, oh yes, one more thing for the story, it's ok, it's not as bad as thor love and thunder"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It's good. Yo kang is amazing
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great start to phase 5, Jonathan Majors as Kang is awesome and Rudd is great as always at Ant Man. Best Ant-Man film by far!"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best AntMan film yet. A great movie to start Phase 5. Kang was awesome, brutal and fierce. 2 post credit scenes. This movie felt like a Star Wars film showing different aliens, worlds. Veb was a scene stealer. I love this movie."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was not good not bad‚Ä¶ It was just rushed and instead of developing the characters and summing the trilogy it was more concentrated on setting the future projects which was a bad idea‚Ä¶ The cast was great and Jonathan Majors was the best thing in the movie‚Ä¶ Overall it was just mid (5/10)
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than love and thunder
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"the pluses: The CGI is getting better, it's still funny, Kang was dope AF, quite fast-paced, and you better not miss the end post credit scene cuz it's worth it.
the minuses: Kathryn's acting is a quite lacking the emotions especially in her eyes, MODOK is weird like I can't look at him, and it's a bit Star Wars-y."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"After seeing Ant-Man 3... It's really amazing than 
most the critics gave this film a credit for when I saw it in theaters. The build-up, the arc of each of every characters, the story, are really good. However, the inconsistency and the script are fell down. Jonathan Majors as Kang is a massive build up for Phase 5, though.

It might not be the best start of Phase 5 and much like Spider-Man 3 of Ant-Man Trilogy, but let's be honest, it was a cool movie. It's not great, but it's not bad either. Better than the second one, of course. 
7.5/10"
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,The story is unnecessary and total bore. Ant man was becoming a secondary character in his last movie and he still remains as a secondary character.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,one of the best movie ever. really dives into the multiverse lore
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente, vale la pena verla"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing this is the true definition of a marvel movie! All scenes were great! I know scott is more of a comedian but he's more serious than Thor in LT!
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sorry, the critics are completely wrong.. see this movie as it's really good and a must for MCU fans, plus  2 post credit scenes that will blow you away."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A mediocre film with the most mediocre plot imaginable. Things happen that make the audience, ""Oh, that happened. Unlikely, but at this point whatever"". Rolled my eyes more than thrice at just how horrible the script is."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a perfect intro to kang. It is also a great start to phase 5 of the. This movie did not deserve the hate it got. The critics reviewed it as a standalone movie and not as a movie which is part of a bigger storyline. Jonathan majors is the perfect casting for kang and probably the best casting in the mcu. His charisma is at an exceptional level. There are some flaws like kathryn newton's performance and modok's cgi. Also, cassie lang always yelling out ""dad"" was annoying at some point. However overall, this movie is great"
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As always Marvel using an amazing villain, for a mediocre movie, Kang doesn't seem to be a threat, Marvel has nerfed him so much, it's ridiculous to think he beat Thor in another universe.
The Cgi is basic, but sometimes it is perceived that it is Cgi, it is so dirty, the actress who plays Cassie does not know how to act in this film, the Wasp is an extra, who does nothing but follow Scott.
The movie's humor is so bad, Scott is so forcing, god, I better have saved the money.
The only good thing is the actor who plays Kang, his performance is impeccable, for a mediocre film, which only serves to launder money."
