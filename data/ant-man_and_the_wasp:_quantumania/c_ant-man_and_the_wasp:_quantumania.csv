"Oct 26, 2023",POSITIVE," El Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel ha estado en constante evolución durante la última década, creando una historia cada vez más grande y compleja. A lo largo de cuatro fases y una saga completa, el estudio ha experimentado con diferentes estilos cinematográficos y ha intentado dar a cada superhéroe su lugar. Sin embargo, Ant-Man siempre ha sido uno de los personajes menos destacados en la franquicia. Hasta ahora.  Las dos primeras películas del Hombre Hormiga, Ant-Man y Ant-Man y la Avispa, son una especie de digestivo, de sorbete de limón, de cigarrito de después, del UCM. Siempre han llegado después o antes de acontecimientos clave en la franquicia. Pero todo cambia con Ant-Man y la Avispa: Quantumanía. La tercera entrega de la trilogía es una película tremendamente importante en el UCM por varias razones. En primer lugar, es la encargada de dar el pistoletazo de salida a la Fase 5. En segundo lugar, presenta a Kang, el nuevo Thanos.  Ant-Man y la Avispa: Quantumanía adquiere una escala mayor que sus predecesoras, no solo a nivel narrativo sino también visualmente, explorando el Reino Cuántico, una dimensión que solo había sido insinuada en las anteriores películas de la trilogía. Una película imprescindible para entender el futuro del UCM."
"Sep 7, 2023",POSITIVE," Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors, has arrived! He is a man out of time and from another time in every way you can imagine. His technology is more advanced and he’s more experienced in the multiverse than pretty much anyone we’ve met so far. The way Majors takes on the role of Kang creates a direct contrast to the rest of the cast, both seasoned and newcomers. Majors as Kang is enough reason to go see Quantumania. We begin with the Ant family, particularly Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), living their best lives and catching up on lost time, but the only person that doesn’t really enjoy post-Blip life is Cassie Lang, played by newcomer Kathryn Newton. She doesn’t like the way everyone is approaching their newly discovered freedom, mostly nonchalantly. And since Cassie wasn’t blipped, she had to endure those 5 years and can’t ignore or neglect the suffering that is still going on in the world. We quickly find out that her grandmother Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) isn’t as comfortable as she seems, but at least Janet isn’t the one working on technology in secret. Cassie and her grandfather Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) have been dabbling with ways to communicate and track the Quantum Realm.  Unknowing to them, someone powerful is patiently waiting with an entire army and is hoping for the slightest opportunity to lure and exhort the Ant family to help him get back the power core to his high-tech throne that will grant  many abilities such as an enhanced armor and the means to journey the Multiverse. The third Ant-Man film does multiple things well, but the three major standouts and reasons to see the film are Majors’ performance, Pfeiffer, and the supporting cast that makes up the Quantum Realm’s Freedom Fighters. Majors is basically acting in a different movie by pretty much owning every scene he’s in, like a true antagonist.  Pfeiffer is given a more integral role this time since she was the one who got stuck in the Quantum Realm for 30 years. The group responsible for most of her survival, the Freedom Fighters led by Jentora (Katy M. O’Brian), Quaz (William Jackson Harper), and Veb (voiced by David Dastmalchian), also pull their weight whenever on screen. If you enjoyed Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, then you’ll also enjoy the VFX work and effects from Ant-Man 3. It’s fresh compared to recent MCU films, but it’s definitely not breaking new ground for movies in general. If you didn’t enjoy the humor of the previous films, then this film takes a turn as well. It’s much more similar to Doctor Strange or a large team-up with just the right amount of comedy, unlike the exhaustive comedy and humor we got from Thor: Love & Thunder. Compared to previous Ant-Man films, Quantumania’s storyline is a bit rushed as well. There’s an assumption that you’ve seen the other sequels and only need a quick refresher to know what’s at stake. Because of this pace, much of the emotional weight falls on the characters.  Hope and Cassie don’t bring much to the table and it seems like a script or editing issue rather than their respective acting ability. Hank finds himself on screen much more than normal which audiences will enjoy, but as aforesaid, the three strong points that make this film enjoyable are Kang, Janet, and the Freedom Fighters.  The Quantum Realm itself receives more screen time than audiences might expect, but we got exactly what Reed promised and we appreciate that from the Yes Man director. And although there are subtle but noticeable reminiscences of Star Wars in this film, the connection doesn’t go beyond that.  Marvel’s attempt to create something that feels like a breath of multiverse fresh air is commendable, so all of the build-up to finally seeing the microscopic world is worth it. And apart from Kang, there are other interesting villains that fans will enjoy seeing in the MCU for the first time. One of the pro and con issues with the film is how it spends little time on the lives of the Ant family and unabashedly introduces fans to The Quantum Realm with an ending that sets up Kang the Conqueror’s return in future films. It’s also worth adding that you should stay for the film’s two exciting post-credit scenes that give us a glimpse of when we might see the conqueror again. Ant-Man 3 gets a rating of 4/5 and you should see it in 3D or at least the best Dolby Digital system you can find for the best experience! Disney’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians takes bold risks in reimagining the iconic series for a new audience as the heart of the show lies in its young heroes."
"Aug 23, 2023",POSITIVE," Partly cloudy skies early will give way to cloudy skies late. A stray shower or thunderstorm is possible. Low 67F. Winds NW at 5 to 10 mph. When I was 13, I came to the realization that having a room full of Star Wars toys and comic books might not be a good look for a teenager. A reclusive kid, I was in the process of leaving behind my childhood home and friends, moving to a different part of Pinellas County, and high school was just around the corner — so it seemed like a good time to make a change. I got rid of my collections — all the things that to my mind felt suddenly childish and immature — and I rebooted myself. I transformed into a much cooler version of me. In other words, I became a reclusive kid who read fantasy and science fiction, watched “Doctor Who” on WEDU every Saturday night, and discovered “Epic Illustrated,” a comics anthology in magazine format published by Marvel Comics that featured explicit content. The point is: Interests change, and priorities evolve over time. So, it doesn’t surprise me that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been taking some heat recently. Critics feel as though Marvel Studios isn’t taking chances, opting to follow familiar formulas and rehash previous plots. Misogynists and other assorted miscreants rail against diversity and inclusivity in MCU properties. Even some lifelong fans are confused by the trajectory of the franchise. The MCU is 15 years old, and some of its best known and most beloved characters from the first cycle of films have either died or have faded into the background. The original set of superheroes that captivated audiences are slowly being replaced by new ones, and audiences are having trouble letting go of those familiar leads and embracing their replacements. It’s only been four years since “Avengers: Endgame.” But those four years, in the real world, have been brutal. The pandemic changed society and compelled us to reevaluate everything. Maybe it made some of us less likely to suspend our disbelief. Maybe it made some of us favor instant gratification over continuing story arcs.  Released Feb. 17, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is the next steppingstone in “The Multiverse Saga,” which is the title given to the MCU’s current story arc that dominates Phases Four through Six. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is the first film of Phase Five and will be followed by “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” set for release on May 5. It picks up on themes covered in “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” including the existence of a seemingly infinite number of alternate realities and dimensions. It also ties into the first season of the Marvel television series “Loki,” and features story threads that will likely be continued in the second season of that show, due to debut on Disney+ sometime this year. The film was directed by Peyton Reed and was written by Jeff Loveness. As of Feb. 19, the film had grossed $104 million in the United States and Canada.  I think critics are being a bit harsh on “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” It’s hardly the incoherent, emotionless placeholder in the MCU machine some have suggested. It’s a fun ride from beginning to end, even if the complicated story is difficult to follow at times. It is a fast-paced adventure with dazzling visuals, a dizzying ensemble of goofy side characters, and enough sci-fi spectacle to make it feel as though it has expanded the boundaries of the MCU. The new film finds Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) balancing life with their responsibilities as superheroes. Meanwhile, Scott’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), has developed an interest in science and technology. With the help of Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), she invented a device that will allow them to explore and map the Quantum Realm. When Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) learns about the project, she warns them all about the potential danger. Her warning comes too late: The device provides a hostile inhabitant of Quantum Realm the means to drag them all down to the subatomic world. Scott and Cassie are cut off from the others and are captured by a group of freedom fighters. Living as refugees, their leader Jentorra (Katy O’Brian) assures Scott that Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) will be searching for them.  Looking beyond all the eye-popping visuals and an overly complicated plot, the story at the heart of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” revolves around Scott and Cassie’s relationship. Circumstances cheated Cassie out of a normal childhood, and Scott — despite his best intentions — often disappointed his daughter. They gradually manage to build a bridge across the chasm that separates them and reconcile, each gaining a new understanding and appreciation of the other.  The film’s focus on that relationship leaves little room for character development elsewhere, unfortunately. There seems to be a disconnect between Scott and Hope at the beginning of the film that is eventually resolved, but it’s not entirely clear where the two of them stand romantically. The other key component of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is Majors’ riveting portrayal of Kang. He cloaks the character in charismatic callousness and inconspicuous malevolence. His Kang is deliciously disingenuous, and you can tell every time he extends a helpful hand, he’s clutching a dagger behind his back with the other. In a film that boasts some outstanding performances from Rudd, Pfeiffer, and Douglas, Majors manages to command every scene in which he appears. A few extra frills: Bill Murray portrays the shifty Lord Krylar, and Corey Stoll returns to the franchise in an unexpected capacity that will either annoy or amuse hardcore comic book fans. Count me among those amused by the revelation. Not only does “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” move the larger story arc forward, it does so with gusto and panache. It retains just enough of the lighthearted tone of previous Ant-Man films to not be jarring. It enhances the father-daughter relationship between Scott and Cassie. Most importantly, it gives viewers a haunting glimpse at what’s yet to come. It may feel like the director ordered a truckload of kitchen sinks to throw into this chaotic, complicated-yet-dumb, serious-yet-silly, imperfect extravaganza, but he still manages to serve up an astonishing tale.  Maybe those critics who are throwing shade at this latest outing will eventually find reason to downgrade their disparagement. People change — and change again. That’s probably why I have so many comic books and Star Wars toys in my house."
"Aug 16, 2023",POSITIVE,While I still like the film overall&#46; Every MCU movie now just becoming setup for the next is making characters like Ant-Man lose some of their charm&#46;
"Aug 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," Film Ahead is a weekly column highlighting special events and repertory programming for the discerning Camberville filmgoer. It also includes capsule reviews of films that are not feature reviewed.  Following its Bugs Bunny Film Festival, The Brattle Theatre is all things Greenaway – as in Peter Greenaway, the man behind “The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover” (1989) – with an early restored four-pack from the Welsh filmmaker that begins with “The Draughtsman Contract” (1982), in which 17th-century renderings of a noble’s estate takes on complexity and sexual overtones, and Greenaway’s experimental contemplation on man and death, “A Zed & Two Noughts” (1985). Both have extended runs beginning Friday, with “The Belly of an Architect” (1987) and “Drowning by Numbers” (1988) on tap next week. This week’s Tuesday “Wild About Wilder” Retro Relay at the Landmark Kendall Square Theatre is the 1959 cross-dressing comedy “Some Like it Hot” starting Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as musicians who witness a mob murder (based on the real-life Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre) and dress up as women to go underground, joining an all-woman band that features Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane (yup, you read that right), the band’s likable ukulele player. Madcap, devilishly wry and timeless. The film that sparked an Oscar controversy because fellow actors began a grassroots campaign for performer Andrea Riseborough (“Oblivion,” “Birdman”) for her role as alcoholic, small-town mom who abandons her 13-year-old son for a life of hedonism after winning the lottery. It’s a turn that for my money is on par with Cate Blanchett in “Tár” and Danielle Deadwyler in “Till,” and while the push may be unconventional (friends using social media – oh my, who’d have thought) let’s keep in mind that studios hire PR firms and pay them millions to push their films, filmmakers and performers for awards season. The film, directed by longtime TV veteran Michael Morris, has a gritty, lived-in vibe as Leslie navigates dives and their skeevy patrons (she’s a natural fit) looking for her next drink. Comparisons to Barbet Schroder’s eloquent leap into slumming “Barfly” (1987) and the more buttoned-up but equally depressing “Leaving Las Vegas” (1995) are fair, even if the conclusion here feels a bit dreamy and out of left field. No matter; it’s nice to see the British-born Riseborough – someone told me British actors are wildly adept at Southern accents, and from this, I’d say so – get the spotlight with a little help from her friends. The supporting cast of Owen Teague as the now 19-year old son, Marc Maron as the motel manager who gives her second and third chances and Allison Janey as a friend who doesn’t add froth to the brimming pour. (Tom Meek) On Amazon Prime Video.  There’s lots of family drama going on in Marvel’s “Quantumania.” Set soon after the events of “Avengers: Endgame” (2019), Scott Lang (ageless Paul Rudd), aka Ant-Man, is basking in the afterglow of public good will, but woke daughter Cassie (newcomer Kathryn Newton, “Booksmart”), chides him for not doing something more meaningful. He discourages her from following in his crime-fighting footsteps. Meanwhile, Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), aka The Wasp and Scott’s girlfriend, quizzes mom Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) about being lost for most of Hope’s life in the Quantum Realm. For the most, Janet keeps mum about her connection to Kang (Jonathan Majors), the baddie of MCU Phase Five (yeah, it just keeps going and going), who is unable to leave the Quantum Realm without Ant-Man’s super powers. Then Ant-Man’s Alfred, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and an experiment gone wrong transports all four into that nether realm. “Ant-Man” (2015) director Peyton Reed helms again, with TV writer Jeff Loveness making his feature film debut. The Quantum Realm pays homage to sci-fi adventures such as “Fantastic Voyage” (1966, RIP icon Raquel Welch), but the two-dimensional supporting characters and bloated, derivative universe-building feel like pink filler for too long before flashbacks reveal Janet and Kang’s time together and give us some pique of interest.

"Aug 9, 2023",NEGATIVE," The “Ant-Man” film franchise has been a good guidepost for gauging the quality of comic book-inspired films. At one end is the superb “Avengers: Endgame” while “Ant-Man” set the standard for how an offering in the genre can manage to be boring and annoying at the same time. A new low for productions has now been established with “Ant-Man and Wasp: Quantumania.” The only thing that keeps it from hitting rock bottom are solid performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors. Both are too talented to be saddled with this failure. It all starts with Paul Rudd’s performance as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. The new film opens with shots of Lang going about his boring life playing out against the TV theme song from “Welcome Back Kotter.” The John Sebastian tune is fitting as Rudd has always played the role as if the character was trapped in a superhero sitcom (and not in a creative way as in “WandaVision”). Lang finally sits down to a family meal with The Wasp/Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and her parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). It is then that Lang learns his now grownup daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), has been trying to virtually explore the Quantum Realm. If you missed the second “Ant-Man” movie (the only good one of the three), the Quantum Realm is a world that is even smaller than microscopic. It is the dangerous world where Janet spent three decades. Faster than you can say “It’s clobberin’ time,” the family members are pulled into the tiny world through Cassie’s experiment. They find a world that has been savaged by a self-appointed ruler known as Kang the Conqueror (Majors). It seems Kang and Janet have a history that she never talked about. The big threat is Kang needs Janet to help him escape the tiny world so that he can go back to conquering universes. She wants no part of it. Screenwriter Jeff Loveness has created a solid core for the story dealing with the importance of family. This sets up a few touching moments and could have driven the film to a better place. When Loveness strays away from the family elements, his script develops holes big enough to have their own gravitational field. Take for example what happens to a bunch of ants pulled into the Quantum Realm with the family. It is conceivable that they could evolve into the intelligent insects presented in the film especially since there is a line that explains they took a left turn and they have been in the realm hundreds of years longer. But, not explanation is given as to how or why their look has been changed so dramatically. That is just one of a long list of writing blips. The errors are easy to miss because the script and all of the acting performances are drenched in a goop of CGI characters that obliterate everything in their path. Director Peyton Reed takes the approach that if 100 weird aliens is plenty then he will use 100,000. The creatures come in tidal waves flowing through a backdrop that is as equally visually chaotic. Everything in the movie looks as if it had been designed to distract more than entertain. The thinking had to be that audiences loved all of the strange worlds and characters in “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” so it should work with the Quantum Realm. But, those wild elements made far more sense as they were at least anchored in a familiar reality. There’s nothing familiar or fun about the Quantum Realm.  It is odd that the same company behind the new “Ant-Man” film was behind the failed animation offering “Strange World.” That film also suffered from a frenzy of weird creatures and odd landscapes. Nothing compares to the creepiness of the character played by Corey Stoll. It would be a spoiler to talk about his role too much. The safe thing to say is that it is a massive failure both in design and story. “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” does set up Kang to be the new big bad in the Marvel Cinematic Universe now that Thanos is dust. That is the only reason to see this production that proves that Rudd and Ant-Man continue to be the low mark for the genre. Still looking for the perfect Mother’s Day gift?

"Jul 25, 2023",NEGATIVE," Despite much discussion about MCU's Phase Four - from its structure to the ever-complicated quantity vs. quality debate - the truth is that it was generally well received. Personally, I prefer this last ""Phase"" to the other(s), but either way, the adventures of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) never really impressed me. If the original is a generic yet decent origin flick, the sequel is one of the few movies in the MCU that didn't get a positive review from me. Considering this and the fact that the ""big bad"" of The Multiverse Saga is introduced – on the big screen – in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, expectations weren't exactly easy to define. One detail that jumps out right away is the script credit. Jeff Loveness is solely responsible for writing Phase Five of the MCU's first movie… a questionable decision given his lack of experience – Quantumania is his feature film debut credit as a screenwriter. In addition to this, the other two Ant-Man movies brought together several people to write each of the stories, which makes this detail even stranger. Putting someone like this in control of one of the most important films in this entire new saga is, to say the least, perplexing. Unfortunately, it's precisely in Loveness' screenplay that the biggest problems with this lie. Quantumania has its favorable attributes, but I will save them all for last, so I can end on a more pleasant note. That said, the amount of unnecessary, repetitive, and irrelevant exposition is, without a doubt, the most bothersome, detrimental narrative trait. The exposition-driven plot depends heavily on many prolonged conversations to pass on information viewers would easily discover by themselves while also occasionally interrupting with flashbacks that break the pacing of a movie with a tough first half to get through. The build-up to Kang's first real appearance – Quantumania is, at heart, a villain's origin story – starts as something quite tense and interesting, but when the character finally arrives to seize the spotlight, there's already a certain accumulated fatigue due to the narrative structure being extremely reliant on such explicit information waiting around every corner. A surprise appearance by Bill Murray, for example, is wasted in a single scene that barely adds anything to any character or the main storyline, repeating the fact that Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) is hiding something, which is addressed countless times before this moment. Another of my biggest personal issues with Quantumania is a common problem across all many MCU films: tonal balance. When there's complete control over the transitions between the more dramatic moments and Marvel's trademark light humor, we are provided with one of the best movies in the franchise. However, when the comedy revolves around the same childish, dated topic – sex jokes – and, at the same time, there's one of the most fearsome, menacing villains we've ever encountered, the transitions can't possibly work out. The vast majority of comedic attempts in Quantumania fall flat, with Rudd's charisma being the ultimate savior, managing to pull off some pretty cringey jokes that would not work with any other actor. Even so, Peyton Reed – the director returns to finish his MCU superhero trilogy – significantly reduces the amount of humor usually present in MCU movies, lessening the negative impact of the inconsistent tonal mix. The final minutes are the perfect example of how much the movie suffers from this particular problem. I must address the lack of serious consequences and performances that fit the supposedly dramatic stakes. In a film where the next Thanos-level villain is initially presented, I cannot be satisfied with a formulaic story where there's no shock value or emotionally powerful moments. I lost count of the number of scenes in which the heroes are being escorted by guards and always manage to free themselves in the exact same way. Furthermore, Kang deserved a much heavier, more substantial impact on the conclusion of the movie. Kathryn Newton plays Scott's daughter, Cassie, in an overly expressive manner, smiling way too much in dramatic scenes, as if nothing that surrounds the character is dangerous or devastating in any way. The actress has amazing talent, so the real issue lies in the lack of direction. Michael Douglas and Pfeiffer don't suffer so much from this problem due to their experience, dealing better with the tonal shifts, but they don't come out unscathed either. Rudd and Evangeline Lilly as Wasp definitely stand out, demonstrating excellent chemistry, but I'll take this opportunity to move on to the positive aspects. Quantumania's real MVP is actor Jonathan Majors, and his absolutely phenomenal performance as Kang. I miss the right vocabulary to describe how incredibly powerful the mere presence of this actor is on the big screen. As many issues as I might have with the first half of the film, when Kang originally appears, my mind doesn't focus on anything or anyone else. Majors draws attention to himself with truly terrifying charisma, elevating every single scene he's a part of impressively. Visuals were my biggest concern, even more than Loveness' unimpressive script overall. The MCU has been receiving criticism – quite fairly – about its visual effects inconsistency, largely due to the overwhelming workload of visual effects artists always at work on what's coming next. Quantumania inherently places all of the characters in a fictional Quantum Realm, which means that virtually the entire movie is surrounded by green & blue walls. Surprisingly, the visuals hold up and make for a remarkably immersive environment, which I didn't expect at all. Add to it the costumes, make-up, sound, and production design, and the similarities to the various worlds seen in Star Wars stories are evident. Quantumania manages to set itself apart with imaginative creature designs and ""villages"" built in unexpected ways. MODOK (played by Corey Stoll) is possibly the only CGI element that might not work for various viewers – the character's wacky concept itself is impossible to make realistic – but personally, I appreciate the ""silliness"" surrounding his design, and the character turns out to have one of the best-developed arcs. And of course, a superhero flick couldn't do without its action. Once again, the numerous CGI backgrounds worried me, but the truth is that Reed delivers several memorable action sequences. Quantumania even has uninterrupted long takes featuring excellent stunts that sadly may go unnoticed amid so much (good) chaos that fills the screen in set pieces with a much greater scale than I ever anticipated. For fans of the genre who go to the theater exclusively in pursuit of the entertainment value, they will hardly leave dissatisfied. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania warrants the divisive response. With immersive visuals, more than satisfying action, and absolutely exceptional performances – except from Newton due to lack of proper direction. However, the excessive, repetitive, unnecessary dialogue driven by exposition, along with a lack of stronger tonal balance – fewer jokes by Marvel standard, but the cringe affects transitions to/from all of the more serious moments – and an underdeveloped narrative devoid of true stakes, character arcs are almost non-existent, make this an overall very inconsistent watch. Still, JONATHAN MAJORS AS KANG! Wow!"
"Jul 25, 2023",NEGATIVE," Welp, the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Phase Five officially kicks off this week with “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” releasing in theaters. Directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Kathryn Newton, it is the third “Ant-Man” film. As far as Marvel comic book movies go, it’s a largely forgettable flick with stunning visual effects aided by its comedic ensemble cast. But the natural takeaway for audiences will be the movie’s introduction of Kang the Conqueror, masterfully portrayed by actor Jonathan Majors. We open with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) enjoying life as a former Avenger, hocking his memoir “Look Out for the Little Guy.” Get it? He’s an Ant-Man. Little Guy. Yeah. Scott continuously attempts to mend his relationship with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), a do-gooder delinquent who spends time tinkering with scientific methods to send signals down into the Quantum Realm. Of course, Cassie never questions Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) about the Quantum Realm, a mysterious place beyond time and space where Janet spent much of her adult life while trying to get herself home. Secretive about what she knows lies hidden in the Quantum Realm, Janet tries to stop Cassie’s experiments but fails to do so before the entire family gets sucked down into the Quantum Realm with no way to escape. This is yet another Marvel movie where the tired trope of recent years makes its way into driving the plot of the film: A central character does something foolish which creates havoc for their world for two hours of screen time while most of the original cast is separated from one another the bulk of the time. In this case, it’s Cassie trying to reach out to the Quantum Realm. Guess what? Someone answered Cassie’s call, and he’s not someone you should mess with. As far as Marvel movies go, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is highly entertaining with dazzling visual effects once the Quantum Realm is revealed in all its glory. It grabs your attention in small doses, like the appearance of new characters inserted for comedic effect, with Bill Murray, Katy O’Brian, and William Jackson Harper chief among them. Even the distracting Marvel fan-favorite MODOK assumes its rightful place in the MCU here, but it’s a forced endeavor at best. When the gang comes face to the face with Kang the Conqueror, Jonathan Majors rules the moment, establishing a character that will take on the Big Bad form of the subsequent phases in the MCU for years to come. A new supervillain that rivals Thanos in his thirst to destroy every world he comes across, Kang is an ominous figure for most of the film until his motives are fully displayed. Majors is perfect in the role and deserves a lot of the credit that Marvel seems to be betting on in the near future.  “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” might be an overstimulated mishmash of an addition to Marvel’s long history of movies and television shows, but it is saved by Paul Rudd’s charm, Michelle Pfeiffer’s commitment to her part, and Jonathan Majors’ balance of sensitivity, viciousness, and bravado. The multiverse is just getting started."
"Jul 25, 2023",NEGATIVE," The third film in the “Ant-Man” trilogy and introductory piece of the fifth phase in the MCU, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” throws away its caper/heist movie individuality for a “bigger” and “broader” story that serves as a “coming soon” announcement to the billion-dollar universe. For most of its run-time, it feels like a filler episode of an anime, with only its climax operating as a narrative “threshold” (which is still, by itself, very messy, uncoordinated, and outright vapid). Where is the Marvel Cinematic Universe headed after “Avengers: Endgame?” That’s the question all of us had in mind after half of the universe got snapped from reality, later to be brought back by an emotional “round ’em up” conclusion. “Infinity War” and “Endgame” felt like proper and well-thought conclusions to the decades spent building that world. But, the Box Office success flame wasn’t going to be extinguished anytime soon. The MCU wouldn’t stop at that point. Yet, still, we go back to that question. What are Kevin Fegie and crew going to do to top that? Four years have passed since the conclusion of the Infinity Saga. Since then, everything that has occurred within the billion-dollar universe has felt like a blur. We get over three (or four) films a year accompanied by three more series. All of them have the same function – a “connect the dots” situation to polish its future. In essence, Marvel fatigue has hit us all, and the emotional involvement we might have had with “Avengers: Endgame” went away as Thanos disappeared from the face of the galaxy. There are a lot of great original pieces of work each year. I have grown tired of seeing these MCU movies because they are all the same. The only film I found myself enjoying in this new saga is “Doctor Strange and The Multiverse of Madness.” For what reason? Because it is ridiculous and makes fun of this multiverse stuff instead of taking it seriously. The action set-pieces felt like pantomime wrestling antics, and the dramatic sequences have the tone of telenovelas. I had a blast with it. The rest of the releases, unfortunately, range from bad to horrible. Some of those projects had the potential to strive. But, since they’re catered to continue building their world for the future fight between multiverses and galaxies, the films lose their cinematic sensibilities and end up being insipid in different degrees. And in the “end all, be all,” they are not treated as films but as products with anti-filmmaking tentpoles. At least plenty of movies succeeded amidst the colossal damage these films have done to the cinematic experience (“Top Gun: Maverick,” “Avatar: The Way of Water,” “NOPE,” “Smile,” amongst others). Sure, some of them are sequels, but the critical aspect is that they are cinematic and creative. These films don’t deliver the same old stuff. The introductory piece to the MCU’s fifth phase, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” compliments my aforementioned arguments to a tee. It is a total slog that removes the caper/heist comedy individuality that made their films enjoyable to set up more of the Universe’s future antics. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” begins with a quirky yet delightful introduction. Scott Lang (played by the always charming and dapper Paul Rudd) is recapping his life as an Avenger by reading the closing chapters of his book, “Look Out for the Little Guy.” It’s pretty funny; these moments where Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang is walking across the streets, serving a smile to the people who recognize him, are the funniest in the film. It even includes a scene where he works at a Baskin-Robbins that got a laugh out of me. Unfortunately, however, the film immediately scratches that and dwells into the world within worlds. In less than five minutes, Peyton Reed removes the most vital aspect of the “Ant-Man” films, its comedic sensibilities within the small adventures for a broader expansion into unknown places. Because of an experiment that Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and the newly recruited Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) were doing with the quantum realm, they drive the attention of a mad conqueror who’s lurking inside — Kang (Jonathan Majors). Kang traps them inside the quantum realm so they can help him get the last piece of the puzzle for multiverse domination. For most of “Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’s” length, nothing actually happens. Most of the scenes feel like they are filling up the run-time. But the thing is that those scenes don’t have a specific purpose in the film. Instead of moving the story, we get sequences resembling “Star Wars.” Out of all the franchises they could have impersonated, they chose the most annoying one. In addition, there’s a lot of misdirection when confronting the big baddie in the picture. It reaches a point where they don’t even want to mention his name for most of its dialogue. It is at the halfway point that they finally acknowledge him. The rest is just excuses to go from place to place — exploring this “new setting.” In the third act, of course, things are about to go down. Director Peyton Reed moves the chess pieces to their final position for the climactic blow. Instead of having a burst of excitement, boredom runs through your slowly-fading eyes. One is too disengaged with the material to care about what’s happening on-screen. The terrible CGI in the action set-pieces provide hymns that lull you to sleep. There’s no excitement running through your body. The best form of popcorn entertainment gives you a rush that keeps you on the edge of your seat. In “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” it does the opposite. You are thinking about how much time it has left. This is unfortunate. This situation didn’t happen with the other two “Ant-Man” films. Their charm and allure of them got severed from the equally captivating quartet of stars (Rudd, Douglas, Lilly, Pfeiffer). You are left with the same old creaky and muddled stuff you have seen before in the MCU. The wandering mayhem of its final act gives the viewer a glimpse into the future. And it all looks highly disappointing and immensely insipid. I don’t think I can handle more of this. As I watch one after the other, year after year, the entertainment value diminishes to a headache-inducing degree. Each attempt looks more careless and without thought. There’s nothing to get out of it anymore; not even the post-credit scenes shine a bright light onto the audience. No one can be bothered by them. The fans might see this as the beginning of something new. However, I see it as a foreshadowing for upcoming damnation — the death of a franchise that once held some value in its favor. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” rings the first bell of total calamity within the MCU, for better or worse and in different aspects.

"Jul 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ant Man And The Wasp Quantumania  The film&#8217;s first act kicks off as a badass Star Wars Adventure BUT slowly tires out towards the middle&#46; Fun&#63; Absolutely&#33; Exposition heavy&#63; Yes&#33;&#10;A mixed bag overall 
"Jul 23, 2023",NEGATIVE," Marvel has amassed a huge fanbase, and Kevin Feige and co. have crafted a form of episodic storytelling over the course of multiple movies and TV shows. Going by the box office returns and the viewership; literally, millions of people are hooked on this particular franchise. But, post “Avengers: Endgame,” some folks have been getting off the proverbial bandwagon and critiquing Marvel’s products based on their subjective opinions about the state of entertainment. Now, this minor shift has been labeled as “superhero fatigue.” Hardcore fans have said that all the negative comments are coming from individuals who are being contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. Some big-brained geniuses have even said that the increase in diversity, in terms of stories and actors, is the reason behind the pessimism. But have you all considered the possibility that Feige’s focus on quantity is leading to a decrease in quality? Anyway, that’s a long-winded way of saying that the latest installment in this exhausting series, Peyton Reed’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” is colossally awful. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” opens with Kang (Jonathan Majors) landing in the Quantum Realm when Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) was trapped in there for around 30 years. In the present, we find out that Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is living a happy and peaceful life with his daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet share the same roof along with Scott’s girlfriend, Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). Cassie has become a rebel and a scientist who has invented a device that works as a telescope into the quantum realm. Kang picks up on this activity and pulls them in. The group gets separated into two, with Scott and Cassie on the one hand and Hope, Janet, and Hank on the other. As shown in the trailers, Kang gets to Scott and Cassie and threatens to kill Cassie if Scott doesn’t do his bidding. Since Janet is aware of Kang’s ulterior motives, they make a mad dash to Kang’s empire in order to stop him from breaking the very fabric of space and time. Marvel isn’t in the business of telling stories. They are in the business of selling action figures. That’s why you have so many characters wearing brand-new but hideous-looking costumes frolicking around to pad the runtime. Think about it: “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is just about Scott and Cassie. Scott regrets that he hasn’t watched Cassie grow up like a father usually does. Cassie is kind of all over the place because she is in this crazy world with superheroes, and she’s the daughter of Ant-Man; hence, she wants to make a difference. But the moment Kang comes into the picture, their personal journeys are thrown into jeopardy again, and they’re forced to save the universe and have some father-daughter time in the process. That’s what’s at the core of the film. However, by adding three other non-essential characters, Loveness doesn’t only hamper the evolution of Scott and Cassie but also takes away crucial screen time from Kang. For what? A few toys? Well, I hope the revenue from them is worth the damage done to the film’s storytelling. The counterargument that usually pops up when you ask for character-based stories or a little focus on “themes” is that nobody is going to Marvel movies for the story; they are going to them for the spectacle. If that is the case, then where is this spectacle? Because all I can see in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is a constant barrage of sludgy, muddy, bland, choppily edited visuals, accompanied by an uninspired score. The great thing about the first two Ant-Man movies was the sense of scale. That’s totally absent, and the characters have to say they’re big to make sure that the audiences understand that they aren’t regular-sized. The action sequences are insulting. It’s one thing to not have a single memorable hand-to-hand fight scene or a chase or anything that’s remotely thrilling (because it’s an action-comedy, after all), and a whole another thing to make sure that the audience can’t see who is fighting whom, feel the impact of the hits, or where everyone is in relation to one another during a battle. There is a lot of VFX and CGI, but that isn’t a compliment anymore. Ensuring that it looks aesthetically pleasing and serves the story instead of populating the background and foreground is what’s important. When it comes to the performances in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” everyone seemed to be running on autopilot. Everyone is being paid millions to not be in character and just spout some exposition that sets up the next chapter of the franchise. So, I completely understand why nobody was putting any effort into their acting, and I wouldn’t have minded it either. But the existence of three people in the film truly infuriated me, and for different reasons. Murray has been accused of sexual harassment in real life and seeing him and others crack sex jokes about his character was vomit-inducing. Lilly has been on an anti-vaccination tirade and seeing her say anything synonymous with science or movie science felt weird. And Kathryn Newton can’t act even if her life depends on it. However, I’m not just angry at these people but at Marvel as well because, despite everything, they chose to stick to their original decisions. Murray and Lilly’s roles are so inconsequential that they could’ve been completely cut out. Emma Fuhrmann’s Cassie had more expressions on her face in that small scene from “Endgame” than Newton displayed over the course of 124 minutes. I don’t know what Newton managed to bring to this role that Emma couldn’t have. Yet, here we are. There’s no doubt that “Avatar: The Way of Water” has been instrumental in opening our eyes to the fact that CGI and VFX-heavy movies can look beautiful, have lots of action, and have a beating heart at their center. But that James Cameron film had been in the works for around a decade. So, you can say that it’s an unfair comparison. That’s why I’ll gladly bring up the other James Cameron movie, “Titanic,” since it was re-released in the same week as “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” and state that the 1997 film doesn’t just hold up but surpass the quality of this 2023 pseudo-action extravaganza. If you don’t believe me, go and watch “Titanic” after you are done with “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Or watch “Titanic” before watching “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumvania.” Either way, do watch “Titanic” (and other blockbusters of its caliber) to realize how Marvel is downgrading the quality of blockbuster filmmaking while flooding the market with their products. Actually, I have a proposition: Re-release a James Cameron film (or any other well-received blockbuster from the past few decades) every time Marvel comes up with something just so that people can do a comparative study. It’ll be educational as hell."
"Jul 20, 2023",POSITIVE," OPINION:  Jonathan Majors shines in the third ""Ant-Man"" film, which does a pretty decent imitation of another movie set in a galaxy far, far away. Have you seen “Star Wars” lately? The movies, TV shows, literally any “Star Wars”? If not and you want to see “Star Wars,” then “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is here for you. It has literally everything from the iconic series: a fascist overlord, a Nazi stormtrooper-looking army and Muppet-like space creatures in a bar ripped straight from the cantina scene in 1977’s “A New Hope,” complete with a rebellion against the evil empire.  That said, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is a good time. With the lovable Paul Rudd as the formerly incarcerated Robin Hood-turned-Avenger Scott Lang at the center, the “Ant-Man” trilogy has always been the most lighthearted fun of the MCU — and, for my abolitionist heart, the one that at least toys with being anti-cop, sometimes. Considering that the vast majority of superhero films are just copaganda, and the vast majority of superheroes are just cops, it’s nice to see Lang’s daughter Cassie (grown up and recast with Kathryn Newton) challenging Lang to fight back against systems of oppression instead of being their agents. In “Quantumania,” Cassie graduates from merely lying to the cops to get them off her dad’s back as she did in the “Ant-Man & the Wasp” film, to actively fighting against them at a protest in support of unhoused people that lands her in jail for the second time. Using Pym Particles, she shrinks one of their cop cars and gives it back to them as a diminutive, harmless toy. Yes, Cassie, F*ck 12! Lang’s guilt over his absence from Cassie’s life also makes for compelling leverage to be used by the absolute best part of “Quantumania”: Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror. If you’re going to reheat “Star Wars,” why not invoke a Shakespearean villain with the gravitas of James Earl Jones’ Darth Vader? Fortunately for us, Kang doesn’t hide his gorgeous face behind a mask, and we get to see every dimension that Majors added to what could’ve been a thin, run-of-the-mill Marvel baddie.  Kang laughs, Kang cries, Kang simmers and explodes. When I tell you Majors was act-ing! throughout that movie. Several times during his performance, I yelled out, “Come on, Yale!” With this level of commitment, it’s clear why Majors and his devious character Kang (and all of his variants) are the future of the MCU’s next phase. Top it off with the delightful William Jackson Harper just popping up out of nowhere being delightful, Michelle Pfeiffer’s Janet kicking ass as a warrior woman in her 60s and Michael Douglas’ Pym defending socialism and organizing an army of ants, and you have a film that’s fun for the whole family. Woke-ish Disney is the better Disney. Don’t get me wrong, I love seeing us as onscreen villains, and Majors is masterful at conveying the complexities of the character bad enough to overthrow Thanos as the worst in the MCU thus far. But I want to see liberated Black folks in the MCU, too, and all “Wakanda Forever” gave us was a ship’s deck full of dead Black people, a whole royal Black family assassinated and two Indigenous nations at war with each other. Enough is enough. After yet another revolution for everybody but Black people in “Quantumania,” “Black Panther 3” better be the most radical thing y’all have ever done. Get it together, Feige! "
"Jul 12, 2023",NEGATIVE, This movie looks bad&#46;
"Jul 5, 2023",NEGATIVE," All of this is mainly in service to setting up a multi-film conflict, and as such Quantumania has no real personality of its own. The previous Ant-Man films have gotten by on being more comedy-oriented, so by saddling this franchise with this kind of apocalyptic conflict, the MCU has made a major miscalculation. It just doesn't work - there is little charm to be found here, and even the unusual cast of creatures feels lackluster and half-baked. This is clearly a movie that thinks itself far more clever than it is, substituting painfully normal ""weirdness"" for personality.  The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been on a downward trajectory for quite some time, but what a miserable, soulless two hours this is. Everything about it is phony and flat from the start, visually unappealing and narratively aimless. It's disheartening to watch so many talented performers traipse through its lifeless green screened landscapes, knowing that there's still more of this yet to come in subsequent films (although likely without Majors, given the seriousness of his legal troubles and domestic abuse allegations). Between the vanishing returns and its banking on a now toxic star, one wonders if it's not time to throw in the towel and go back to square one on this entire depressing enterprise. "
"Jun 27, 2023",NEGATIVE," The multiverse is cooked. After years spent sucking at the teat of Big Time Travel, Hollywood found a new concept to hurl itself at. And in record time, the town beat its new prized horse to death. If we’ve learned anything from the recent glut of multiversal content, the same thing probably happened to the horse across countless timelines and parallel worlds. We just happen to live in the timeline where the narrative glue factory shows no signs of slowing down. It’s hard to believe that we’re only four years removed from the critical and commercial heights of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Long before Everything Everywhere All at Once transformed from the little A24 engine that could into an award-season juggernaut, Into the Spider-Verse was reshaping an entire industry in its image on its way to an Oscar of its own.  There’s a lot of TV out there. We want to help: Every week, we’ll tell you the best and most urgent shows to stream so you can stay on top of the ever-expanding heap of Peak TV. But since last March, the multiverse’s once bright future has hit multiple hitches. February’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is among the most critically reviled movies in Marvel cinematic history, while also earning the distinction of having the worst second-week drop-off at the box office for an MCU film. This year will feature two DC movies—Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash—that will soon be retconned to make way for a new universe. And Rick and Morty has gone from one of the most valuable titles in the Warner Bros. Discovery portfolio to a distressed asset in the wake of domestic battery and false imprisonment charges brought against cocreator Justin Roiland.  Creatively, the multiverse was supposed to mean boundless opportunity, a chaotic narrative device to mirror our turbulent times. Instead, it’s only highlighted the rotting foundation of the entertainment industry and its inextricable tie to the stories we tell. It’s a magic eraser used to undo missteps and add a fleeting sense of grandeur to studios overly reliant on formula. Decades of never-ending franchises, rehashed IP, and mismanaged, interconnected universes were always going to bring us to this moment. When all the Oscars are won and film Twitter finds a new shiny discourse toy to obsess over, Everything Everywhere will stand as the watershed moment of multiversal storytelling. The fact that a movie as absurd, bombastic, and earnest as Everything Everywhere works is a mini-miracle. In many darker timelines, it probably doesn’t. The irreverent action-comedy is a monument to risk in an industry hell-bent on sanding it away for the greater good of its balance sheets. Its directors, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, and cast commit to hundreds of bits (e.g., hotdog fingers, googly-eyed stones, a raccoon chef). For two-plus hours, the film travels to every crevice of creative id and refuses to flinch at the emotion and corniness that stare back.  This was the beginning of a renaissance for all parallel-world-adjacent content, and if there’s a patient zero for this moment, it’s hard not to point the finger at the coughing kid wearing the Rick and Morty T-shirt. Created in 2013 by Dan Harmon and Roiland, the Back to the Future send-up featured an alcoholic inventor grandpa and his relentlessly horny grandson hopping from universe to universe. By 2017, the Adult Swim cartoon became the no. 1 TV comedy among millennials; at the same time, the world started to curdle against the show’s often toxic fan base and the embarrassing Szechuan sauce fiasco it spawned. As the streaming boom commenced and traditional comedies disappeared from the big and small screens, Rick and Morty filled a void. It was an angry show for turbulent times, and its nihilistic bent often masked rare moments of warmth. The show’s meta and self-referential qualities seemed engineered to circumvent the expectations of a hyper-jaded and connected audience. This was an audience similar to the one that Kevin Feige was trying to sustain after concluding the decades-spanning 23-movie colossus called the Infinity Saga. It also didn’t hurt that Rick and Morty was giving these viewers a crash course in the Gordian knot of multiversal storytelling. So instead of reinventing the wheel, Feige simply ported it over.  If you’ve heard about an MCU movie or show in recent memory, there’s a good chance it was written by a Rick and Morty alum. Loki, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania were all helmed by former writers on the show. Two of Marvel’s most important movies going forward (Avengers: Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret War) will also have that distinction.  When Feige announced the Multiverse Saga last summer, it was supposed to be a creative coup. He was basing the studio’s trajectory on beloved source material. The magical space gem MacGuffins that fueled the first decade of the MCU’s existence were jettisoned in favor of Jonathan Majors yelling about variants, timelines, and incursions.  The problem of how to replace beloved movie stars like Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans was seemingly answered. If you can’t beat ’em, simply promise that somewhere off in the near future, there will be infinite versions of them (or at least of their characters). The results were mixed. For every beloved Spider-Man: No Way Home—which reunited three generations of white boys with spider powers—there were critically derided missteps like Eternals, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Thor: Love and Thunder, and, most recently, Quantumania. So far, the weirdest things that have happened in the multiverse era of the MCU involve one world having pizza balls instead of slices, a Norse god getting horny for the female version of himself, and Benedict Cumberbatch and Majors playing evil alter egos with goatees.  The MCU was already showing signs of stress before Quantumania opened the floodgates of disdain. Its rushed CGI, stitched-together plot, and paper-thin character motivations continued a trend that started in the aftermath of 2019’s Endgame. Despite what Rotten Tomatoes would have you believe, it’s nowhere near the second-worst MCU entry. But even though it was designed to bring us one step closer to understanding the wonders of the multiverse, Quantumania simply spun its wheels. It doesn’t help that a sentient piece of broccoli and an alien obsessed with holes are the most outlandish ideas it could offer an audience in 2023.  The problem unfolding on-screen is the same one that’s burdened writers of the source materials for decades. In practice, setting a story in the multiverse is asking the audience to perform free labor. It’s homework porn delivered by the type of guy who thinks all of society’s ills are engineering problems. Understanding, categorizing, and labeling the sheer abundance of narrative choices becomes a more lucrative endeavor than developing the emotional weight of the movie or TV show you just watched.  There’s such a thing as too much story. And often, the very thing you create to keep a universe growing exponentially is what ends up making it impossible to parse for anyone who isn’t interested in devoting their lives to YouTube explainer videos.  Even worse, it lowers the stakes of the storytelling. Even Loveness has acknowledged as much: “The downside to multiverse stories is that it can make your characters seem disposable, or it can make your story line seem unimpactful if there’s an unlimited amount of these characters out there,” he told The Hollywood Reporter.  “The audience,” he added, “is a bit smarter than we give them credit for, and the trick is to find the humanity in the middle of it.” The multiverse has had many lives that predate geriatric cartoon scientists and actors padding their retirement plans with MCU money. Thousands of years ago, Greek philosophers like the Atomists and Stoics argued about their place in an infinite universe. At various points, there’s been whatever is happening on Dr. Who in any given timeline. By 2008, even J.J. Abrams was running a Fox show about parallel worlds starring Anna Torv that’s been lost from our collective consciousness. But the most persistent home of the multiverse has always belonged to the world of superheroes, where the idea of parallel universes is ingrained into the fabric of comic book storytelling.  In the Marvel Universe alone, there’s Earth-616 (where most of the comics you know are set), Earth-2149 (home to the Marvel Zombies), and Earth-1610 (Ultimate Universe, sometimes the residence of Miles Morales). While Marvel introduced the concept in 1962, DC Comics is still the keeper of arguably the most lucrative and influential multiverse in recorded human history.  The home of Batman, Superman, and James Gunn has made it a nearly biannual tradition for its characters and, by extension, the publishing house to argue over the merits of the device. In 1961, the retooled version of the Flash that we know (a.k.a. Barry Allen, the guy played by Ezra Miller and the less problematic Grant Gustin) met his World War II counterpart (a.k.a. Jay Garrick, who wears a Frisbee on his head) in a comic book called The Flash of Two Worlds.  Quickly, one Earth became two, then hundreds and thousands. Every trip to another world was aptly titled a “crisis.”  A crisis on Earth-One turned into another on Earth-Two and Three and A and Prime. Predictably, by 1985, that amount of continuity became new-reader repellent, and Crisis on Infinite Earths was born. The 12-issue series by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez was meant to be a onetime spring-cleaning event to reconcile years of publishing chaos. (Wolfman admitted as much to The Village Voice in 2011.) But instead of simply bringing much-needed accessibility to an ever-expanding universe, Crisis and its commercial success took the guardrails off an entire industry. Since 1985, there have been eight subsequent events of varying quality in which a collective of writers decides whether to kill the multiverse or bring it back. One event featured an evil Superboy punching reality; another included a Barack Obama Superman. “Its sales is what made everyone suddenly decide to copy the concept,” Wolfman told the Voice. “Crisis spawned an entire industry of mega-events when it should have only given birth to those kinds of events where something vitally important had to be achieved.” The problem Wolfman tried to solve almost 40 years ago is no longer reserved for the comics. As Hollywood’s IP factory continues to churn, hoping to chase the financial heights of comic book movies, every franchise is now seen as a never-ending story, whether or not it can support itself under that weight.  The DCU, formally known as the DCEU, is on its second interconnected universe in under a decade. Miller’s Flash movie is rumored to reset years of Zack Snyder chicanery so that Gunn can start fresh. The Lord of the Rings is currently torn between an emerging Amazon-backed canon and Warner Discovery’s attempts to woo back Peter Jackson to helm more films. The problem has gotten so out of hand that Will Smith and Michael B. Jordan are making an I Am Legend sequel based on deleted scenes that are now canon and that contradict the ending of the original film. But it was always destined to go this way. The multiverse problem isn’t about people but about the machine. It takes only a few years for a nifty storytelling device to atrophy into a gimmick. At this point in award season, Everything Everywhere has become a symbol through the sheer momentum of its wins at smaller ceremonies, but also out of necessity. The fact that this will be the first year in Oscar history when four Asian actors will receive nominations is a perfect encapsulation of how long overdue this moment has been. When you factor in nominations for RRR, Turning Red, All That Breathes, and Living, it’s a banner year for white organizations finally honoring Asian films.  If there is one unifying theme in Everything Everywhere acceptance speeches, press runs, and interviews, it’s multiple generations of stars from the movie coming to terms with how thoroughly they were marginalized by the industry.  In 2021, Ke Huy Quan struggled and failed to book the one job necessary to keep his health insurance. In an impassioned SAG Awards speech, James Hong went back to the days of Clark Gable to describe the racist treatment actors like him received in the industry before he told the crowd, “The producer said that Asians were not good enough, and they are not box office. But, look at us now, huh?” Even Michelle Yeoh, despite her lengthy career, has made sure to use any and all airspace to demand more seats at the table for actors who look like her. Everything Everywhere has the unenviable task that many POC-led Oscar contenders face. In its theatrical run, it made more than $100 million worldwide. This weekend’s Creed III made that much in its debut. That comparison isn’t meant to take anything away from the Yeoh-starring film, but to illustrate how vastly the A24 picture has transformed from a wildly inventive action movie with a modest budget to a prestige film at the center of the conversation. By virtue of having the most nominations in a record-breaking year for Asian filmmakers at the Oscars, it must contend with past transgressions it didn’t create and hope that it’s not one of the last to achieve these heights. In a poetic sense, that’s the nature of the multiverse as well. It expands exponentially, whether planned or not.  The line that will define Everything Everywhere years from now is delivered by Quan’s character, Waymond Wang, at the climax of the movie. “In another life, I would have really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you,” Waymond says to a version of his wife, Evelyn, that he never got to marry. The line has been immortalized, cherished, memed, and ridiculed. It’s a microcosm of the film it comes from. If you look at it one way, it says so much about the beautiful mundanity of true love, and from another vantage point, it’s about the enduring quality of caring for another no matter the circumstance.  But in the unsexiest of ways, it’s also about choice. The viewer has already seen what parts of this dream entail for different versions of Evelyn and Waymond. It means a life of late bills, the rise of routine at the cost of passion, and enough misunderstandings to fuel a multiverse. In a movie, industry, and world built on the notion that more is better than less, Waymond still yearns for something smaller and imperfect. For us to get back to that, we might have to look beyond the multiverse.  Three days after its release, how’s the double album landing?

"Jun 24, 2023",NEUTRAL," Solía ser que las películas de Marvel Studios eran el evento cinematográfico del año, de hecho, solía ser que las películas más grandes del año eran estas, las que más personas estaban esperando y por más tiempo permanecían en los cines. Pero todos los reinados llegan a un fin, y aunque probablemente sigamos viendo películas del MCU, creo que lo que una vez fue su bendición, ahora la mayor estaca de estas películas es tener que ser parte de un universo. La comparación es inevitable, en todos los aspectos de la vida, pero en el cine está aun más presente pues como audiencia se nos resulta casi imposible analizar algo sin partir de una experiencia previa. Y con las películas de Marvel, el sentimiento de nostalgia agobia a muchos a la hora de exponerse a las nuevas propuestas, resultando en que cada vez más, las películas te gusten menos. La expectativa de revivir lo que estas cintas una vez te hicieron sentir hace que las aniquilemos de manera casi instantánea. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania”, es la tercera parte de lo que para muchos puede ser la trilogía menos fuerte del UCM, pues desde su primera entrega, el personaje de Ant-Man fue catalogado como un release cómico para el universo, este tono sirve de manera magistral en aquella primera película, pero más adelante sirvió como cuchillo de doble filo cuando la segunda, y ahora tercera entrega, no contaban con introducción de personajes sino que debían mover adelante el universo e historias individuales de los protagonistas. El universo cuántico siempre fue un haz bajo la manga del UCM, lo utilizaron para avanzar la historia de “Avengers”, y desde siempre fue tentado como aquel lugar incomprensible para el cual nuestras mentes nunca estarían preparadas para asimilar. El primer tropiezo de Quantumania fue simplificar por completo lo que ocurría en aquel universo diminuto, pues lo que debió ser algo tan asombroso como “Inception”, se convirtió en una mera copia de todas las sociedades que habíamos visto antes en Marvel. No existe diferencia entre un planeta visitado por los Guardianes de la Galaxia, y los organismos que viven en el universo cuántico, y esa simpleza caricaturizó demasiado la dinámica entre los héroes y su alrededor. De repente, no nos tomábamos nada en serio, cosa que atormentaría después las apuestas de la película, nuestro apego a los personajes y el trabajo de su villano. Técnicamente la película es casi animada, una vez entramos al universo cuántico, entre esto y la versión nueva de “The Lion King” hay muy poca diferencia. Y aunque los efectos visuales estaban muy bien, aquella saturación de lo ficticio cargaba los ojos hasta el punto de cansancio. Está bien que estamos viendo un superhéroe, pero si su cara es de humano, necesitamos algo que nos mantenga atados a la realidad. De alguna forma me acordó a lo que se sentía viendo “Spy Kids”. Por momentos tiene muy buena comedia, conectamos con las emociones de los personajes, nos emocionamos con algunas acrobacias y nos sorprendemos con alguna que otra secuencia, pero estos breves segundos no son suficientes para salvar sus dos horas de metraje, que se ocupan por completo en los hombros de lo mejor de la película, Jonathan Majors como Kang, un villano sentido, presente y víctima de la película que le rodea."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," Creative world building and a compelling villain performance  from Jonathan Majors helps Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania deliver as  a solid superhero movie, albeit one that doesnât match up against previous MCU  entries. Perhaps itâs a case of superhero movie fatigue, but there  are moments in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania that donât click. The third  movie in the Ant-Man franchise, and the first to launch Phase Five of  the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU for the cool kids) shrinks when it depends on  its assemblage of heroes to see it through. Even the ever-charismatic Paul Rudd  has an air of âbeen there, done thatâ about him. Thankfully, the âQuantumâ in the âQuantumaniaâ picks up  the slack. The MCU has delivered numerous exotic and strange worlds ranging from  Asgard in the Thor movies to the varied planets featured in the Guardians  of the Galaxy film series, and the Quantum Realm is a highlight among  them. A blend of 1960s sci-fi kitsch and 1980s post-apocalyptic grunge, the  Quantum Realm is filled with an array of wacky characters: there is a walking,  talking blob with an obsession with holes; a warrior whose head is a supernova  contained within a thick glass cylinder; and a large floating head that had  been mechanised into a killing machine. At every turn zanier creations feature that  will no doubt be a future action figure collectorâs item. Into the Quantum Realm drops Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul  Rudd) and his family of scientist heroes: Hope Van Dyke aka the Wasp  (Evangeline Lilly); her parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janey Van Dyne (Michelle  Pfieffer); and Scottâs teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton.) Like raisins on an inner-galactic pizza, the Ant-Man regulars are a bland pack of squares in a vibrant world that deserves a better  kind of hero. Douglas and Pfieffer are going along with the motions while no  doubt pondering how their careers have been reduced to small parts in green  screen spectacles; Lilly is all scowl and no charisma; and MCU newcomer Newton  is tirelessly annoying as a know-it-all teen, whose woke-infused delusions of  grandeur almost makes us root for her characters demise. Thankfully salvation arrives in the form of a time-lord,  with Jonathan Majorsâ turn as the new MCU chief villain Kang the Conqueror  bringing with it a weight and danger that brings with it stakes worth investing  in.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the third Ant-Man film to be directed by Peyton Reed, and it is clear he is running out of  creative juice here. A change of direction is needed for the Ant-Man series to reignite that fun, creative spark that the first Ant-Man film  had. Otherwise, perhaps it is time Marvel squash this bug."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Like it or not&#44; this is the ouroboros the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become&#46; Kang&apos;s backstory may be a little more convoluted than Thanos&apos;s&#44; but in the end he also just wants to &quot;burn the broken worlds&quot; to create a better one&#46;
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE," ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA (2023). The Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Phase Ho-Hum ended with the release of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and Phase Shoulder Shrug kicked off with the theatrical bow of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Like the majority of the entries following the Avengers’ ultimate triumph over Thanos, A-MatW:Q is a middling effort marked by bright performances and a few unique ideas but bogged down by cluttered visuals, cutesy humor, and a rigid adherence to formula. It amuses me that this is only the second out of 32(!) MCU titles to earn a Rotten grade from the RT-approved critics (Eternals was the first), since it’s comparable to quite a few (e.g. Iron Man 3, Thor: Love and Thunder, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) and actually superior to a couple (including last year’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness). Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, and the other series stars are back, Kathryn Newton joins the good guys as the now grown Cassie Lang, and Jonathan Majors is the villainous Kang the Conqueror. There’s some trippy CGI, several insufferable supporting characters, and Bill Murray. Blu-ray extras include audio commentary by director Peyton Reed and writer Jeff Loveness; featurettes on the film’s heroes and villains; deleted scenes; and a gag reel. THE LONGEST YARD (1974) / HUSTLE (1975). Director Robert Aldrich was responsible for so many movies that fall under the “macho” heading (The Dirty Dozen, Emperor of the North, Attack) that it’s no surprise he eventually made a couple of films with that most macho of ‘70s actors, Burt Reynolds. Both titles are newly arrived (and sold separately) on the Kino label, with The Longest Yard available in a 4K UHD + Blu-ray edition and Hustle available as a Blu-ray. While 1974’s Top 10 Moneymakers list was dominated by disaster flicks (The Towering Inferno, Earthquake, Airport ’75) and Mel Brooks (Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein), Reynolds held down the #8 spot with The Longest Yard, which remains one of the best and brightest films on his resume. He stars as Paul “Wrecking” Crewe, a former football star and newly anointed convict who’s pressured by the sadistic Warden Hazen (Eddie Albert) into putting together a team of prisoners to play against the semi-pro guards’ squad. The laughs are plentiful, the gridiron action is hard-hitting, and the few instances of heavy drama make their mark. A Golden Globe winner for Best Motion Picture — Comedy or Musical, this earned Michael Luciano an Academy Award nomination for Best Film Editing. A mediocre remake followed in 2005, with Adam Sandler miscast in Reynolds’ old role and Burt himself appearing in a supporting slot (there was also a 2001 British adaptation, Mean Machine, with soccer substituting for American football). The next collaboration between Aldrich and Reynolds also proved to be a hit, although nothing like The Longest Yard in terms of either profitability or quality. It’s certainly a bleaker affair, with the actor cast as Phil Gaines, a Los Angeles detective assigned to look into the fatal OD of a young woman (porn star Colleen Brennan). Gaines plans to dismiss the case as a suicide, but the girl’s father (Ben Johnson) conducts his own investigation and learns that she was a hooker who kept company with a corrupt attorney (Eddie Albert again) who, as it happens, is also involved with Phil’s girlfriend, a high-class French prostitute (Catherine Deneuve). The film’s structure is interesting in theory — it’s a murder-mystery where there may have been no murder and thus no mystery — but with nothing fresh to replace the expected genre trappings, what remains is a mopey movie with unconvincing developments, flashes of forced humor, and a truly terrible denouement (a character dies only to complete the story’s existentialist bingo card). Coincidentally, Sandler also starred in a movie called Hustle but, unlike The Longest Yard, this 2022 release has nothing in common with Burt’s same-named predecessor. Both titles offer audio commentary by authors Alain Silver and James Ursini (What Ever Happened to Robert Aldrich?: His Life and His Films); the theatrical trailer; and trailers for other Reynolds flicks on the Kino label. The Longest Yard also includes audio commentary by Reynolds and producer Albert S. Ruddy and a pair of behind-the-scenes pieces, while Hustle includes TV spots. MIDNIGHT RUN (1988). As someone notes in one of the interviews included in this 4K edition of Midnight Run, the movie opened on the same day (July 20, 1988) as the sleeper smash Die Hard, and that helped cement the film’s doom at the box office. That’s a shame, because this is an extremely satisfying action-comedy, one that still hasn’t fully received its due. Director Martin Brest, coming off the red-hot Beverly Hills Cop (and with the odious trio of Scent of a Woman, Meet Joe Black, and Gigli still to come), and scripter George Gallo fire on all cylinders in presenting this uproarious tale in which bounty hunter Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro) tries to keep accountant Jonathan Mardukas (Charles Grodin) alive long enough to deliver him to a sleazy bail bondsman (Joe Pantoliano) — a near-impossible assignment since Mardukas was daft enough to embezzle from ruthless mob kingpin Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina). De Niro has rarely been this loose and likable on screen, while Grodin, cast in a role for which the studio wanted either Robin Williams or Cher, is brilliant as his constant foil. Danny Elfman’s excellent score is another asset. SHAZAM! FURY OF THE GODS (2023). My overall indifference to the superhero cinema of recent vintage continued with 2019’s Shazam!, which impressed most crix to the tune of a generous 90% RT score while only earning a mixed review from me. We’re on the same page with this sorry sequel, whose 49% Rotten seems fairly accurate. Helen Mirren is the latest Oscar-Winning Legend™ who figured she could make more moolah from one superhero saga than 10 prestige projects combined, so she’s on board as the goddess Hespera — along with her sisters Kalypso (Lucy Liu) and Anthea (it would be a spoiler to tell, although any reasonably bright 10-year-old will figure it out), she hopes to replant the Tree of Life (no word if Terrence Malick was a special consultant). So it’s up to foster kid Billy Batson (Asher Angel) to again call upon his adult alter ego Shazam (Zachary Levi) to save the day, joined by all the other foster kids and their heroic counterparts. Jack Dylan Grazer again amuses as wisecracking Freddy Freeman, and his scenes with the grouchy wizard (returning Djimon Hounsou) are the movie’s best. Everything else is overstuffed and overbearing, and this year’s award for Most Blatant Product Placement has already been claimed by Skittles (who knew unicorns loved them so?). TARGETS (1968). Under the auspices of Roger Corman (serving as producer), Peter Bogdanovich made his sure-footed directorial debut with this tense drama and long-time cult favorite he co-wrote with his then-wife, production designer Polly Platt. Boris Karloff stars as Byron Orlok, an aging horror film star who wants to retire from the business because he feels that his movies can no longer compete with the terrors of everyday life. Proving his point, the picture tackles a second storyline that finds a clean-cut, all-American youth (Tim O’Kelly, whom Matt Damon eerily resembles) casually going on a shooting spree that leaves a number of innocent people dead. The movie’s focus on gun control (or lack thereof) makes it as timely today as it was 55 years ago — the sniper gets his hands on a whole arsenal of weapons about as easily as you or I can snag a pack of Dentyne — yet for film buffs, Targets‘ primary power derives from seeing Karloff in his last great role (he passed away the following year). Blu-ray extras include audio commentary (from 2003) by Bogdanovich; a 2003 introduction to the film by Bogdanovich; and excerpts from a 1983 interview with Platt. UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN (2003). In this largely fictionalized adaptation of Frances Mayes’ memoir, Diane Lane is wonderful as our heroine, who, on the heels of a nasty divorce, heads to Italy on a vacation arranged by her best friend (Sandra Oh, playing a character more suited to a network sitcom). There, she falls in love with the Tuscan countryside and on a whim purchases a dilapidated villa in need of dire restoration. But as she works on the house and becomes acquainted with the locals, she realizes there’s still one thing missing from her rapidly improving lot in life: amore. Under the Tuscan Sun largely plays out as one might expect, although the journey is so enjoyable that many viewers won’t mind being led down this familiar path once more. Lane’s heartfelt performance provides pools of depth to her character’s plight, and the supporting players are for the most part a finely drawn bunch, especially Vincent Riotta as a sympathetic realtor whose married status forces him to suppress his attraction to Frances and Lindsay Duncan as a flamboyant actress constantly rhapsodizing about the brief time she worked with Fellini. A warm and luminous film, Under the Tuscan Sun is perfect for a romantic summer night on the couch."
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,This feels like a &quot;stepping stone&quot; film that came off like a &quot;Star Wars&quot; rip-off&#46; This didn&apos;t move the needle for the MCU or these characters&#46; 
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,I wasn&apos;t a big fan of this movie and some of the performances&#46; I was surprised with how low the stakes in this story were&#46; Kang was wasted and Michael Pena was greatly missed&#46;
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL," Quantumania opens up with Ant-Man himself Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) loving life as a celebrity, doing book signings and the like, while enjoying time with his new family unit of girlfriend Hope / The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Janet Van Dyne and Hank Pym (Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who is now a teenager due to the snap, meaning Scott missed out on a lot of her growing up. It’s a talented lead cast, though I will say Douglas phones it in somewhat across the whole film and Cassie is barely developed beyond her single character trait of “wants to stick up for the oppressed” but overall they’re a good unit. Cassie has taken after her sort-of adoptive grandad in Hank and developed a piece shrinking technology that can send signals and scan the quantum realm but as Janet panics and tries to shut it off the whole lot of them get sucked down into the Quantum Realm themselves and to everyone bar Janet’s surprise there is an entire multi-cultural world of intelligent species and mega-cities in there. It’s here where the film shines most as I really enjoyed the artistic side, the crazy backdrops, the weird architecture and some of the alien designs were all done really well. We’re soon introduced to the villains of the piece, that being Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) and his underling M.O.D.O.K, who finally makes his MCU debut after countless years of people saying his design is too weird to work in the more realistic live action MCU… I mean they ended up correct, but hey. Sadly it could’ve worked as when M.O.D.O.K is flying around his its metal face-mask on it looks fine in the weird world of the Quantum Realm but it spends a lot of the film with the mask down, revealing the weird enlarged head of Corey Stoll back as Darren Cross from the first Ant-Man film. I like the idea of following up on that plot-thread (admittedly a thread I was happy to consider done with…) but they should’ve had him with the mask on the whole time, maybe revealing the head as a last-minute sight gag at the end. Ah well. Oh and Loki and Morbius from the Loki TV series appear in a mid-credits scene, also searching for Kang variants. Looking forward to that at least!"
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL," ‘I’m lucky I met Hope van Dyne,’ says Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) in the usual peppy sunshine opening. ‘I think YOU know who she is!’ Sigh. No, Scott, your confidence is unfortunately misplaced, I don’t know, I don’t remember, and if you’re not going to explain as the narrator of your own story, I don’t know who IS going to tell me. Films which confidently assume that you’ve been researching the characters for months previously make a big assumption; that’s we’re all hard-core Marvel fans with nothing better to do. Sure, there’s certainly lots of fan-boys around, but a genuine hit film needs to appeal to more than its base, and there’s little here to engage once we abandon the sunshine for two hours plus of utter green-screen muck. Ten minutes in, Ant-Man, his pal Hope (Evangeline Lily) and her father Hank (Michael Douglas) and his wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Lang’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) use their super-powers to travel to the Quantum realm; ‘It’s a place outside space and time, it’s a secret universe!’ we’re told when we arrive. ‘A sub-atomic universe, this changes everything!’ says Hank Pym, before gawping at a freaky passer by; ‘That guy looks like broccoli.’ But such frivolity aside, big bad Kang the Conqueror rules over this universe with his dreary cod-Shakespearian intonation, and soon Ant-Man’s differently sized-team face a choice;  either get small, get big or go home. ‘Socialism is a charged word,’ says Hank Pym; it feels like Michael Douglas was allowed to draft a few lines of his own dialogue here, but not enough. There’s little political, meaningful or even particularly quantum about the quantum realm; it’s just the usual collection of docile, downtrodden oddities waiting for their white saviour. Can our heroes form a neuro-kinetic link with the multiversal engine core? Why is Bill Murray dragged into this for a one-and-done single-scene cameo? And what’s with that awful MODOK thing which looks like a 2000 AD mekon rendered in tatty 1981 visual effects graphics? ‘Just because it’s not happening to you, doesn’t mean it’s not happening,’ is about as close as we get to any philosophical insight here, although there are some grace notes; eels frontman Mark Oliver Everett turns up for a cameo, and his dad was a real life quantum physicist, as detailed in his excellent 2007 book Things the Grandchildren Should Know. A quick swatch at that book reveals more than a thousand hours of Quantumania’s old-school Lost World shenanigans; despite familiar faces, this film’s action sorely lacks the ingenious charm offered by the super-scale skirmishes seen in the first two Ant-Man films, and the result is incomprehensible gibberish for those of us who refuse to do our homework. Will definitely be watching this, but am not holding my breath that it will be as enjoyable as the previous two. If disney expects me to watch the tv shows to know what is going on, forget it! Urk. Didn’t like Majors even before he (allegedy) beat up his missis, didn’t like the first Ant movie so won’t be seeing this. In fact Marvel & I parted company after the Endgame- I think I’ve said it before, but the clue was in the title. Big fat crope. Aside from the first and last five minutes, it’s was green screen all the way, and a universe that just seemed like the butt of lame jokes. The Ant Man films are popular enough that I can see why they thought they could smuggle in a new big bad, but it feels like they’ll need to think again. There’s precious few instances of this happening before, so they’ll have to rethink the whole shebang; Disney even seem a bit loathe to promote this film now given that Majors is the big attraction. Agreed; a very empty experience. No complains about the production values, as high as you’d expect, but the overall story was not great at all. Think this was shot during lockdown and that this was a factor in it being so CGI heavy? I did wonder (a) just how many lines Evangeline Lily had & (b) if the opening sequence – ie, Antman walking along the street – was shot after the lockdown as a corrective. It’s messy for sure. I’m not sure any two hour movie shot extensively on green screen and without natural light could ever work; as you say, these bookends don’t really connect with the rest of the story and could have been added later. Lily seemed to drift in and out of this movie, and it has the airless feel of a Covid era production. This demo site is only for demonstration purposes.

"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE," As the stage-setter for the MCU's Phase Five, Quantumania is a success. It further explores the Multiverse and introduces us to Kang (Jonathan Majors), a menacing, dimension-hopping villain. But for those who enjoyed the lower stakes of past Ant-Man movies - as well as those who were hoping the MCU would course-correct after a so-so Phase Four - it's often a failure. Even in the Quantum Realm, all you'll find is another building block of content that will come out quarterly but leave no lasting impression. Peyton Reed joins James Gunn as the only director to take an Avenger (or adjacent team) from start to finish. While his quirky humor served the first two films well, he's operating with one hand tied behind his back. The movie wants to be a major universe-altering event. So the trademark goofiness, while welcome, often feels out of place. The first two entries featured clever uses of Ant-Man's size, like a big showdown on a model train track or a tiny car chase through the hills of San Francisco. None of that happens here, so there's no sense of scale or innovation. This is another superhero movie where the powers are often sidelined for punching. But there are some wonderful moments. An early meeting at a Quantum Realm watering hole suggests a sub-atomic Deep Space Nine, with all sorts of odd creatures cutting deals and trying to get laid. And a major plot action - which I won't spoil - nearly unravels when Scott starts seeing billions of possible versions of himself, leading to an existential crisis. And just wait until you meet M.O.D.O.K. These bursts of creativity make it easier to ignore some dodgy VFX work, repetitive action and Evangeline Lilly's complete lack of screen presence. Still, if Avengers past and future are destined to face off against Kang, it's a good thing Jonathan Majors has the chops required for such a major part. I first noticed the talented actor in 2019's The Last Black Man in San Francisco. His star has risen quickly, with an HBO series, a Spike Lee movie and Creed III on the horizon. He imbues Kang with the right amount of cruelty, ego and obsession to make him believably dangerous."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL," Can’t say it’s a surprise that Hulu will soon be folded into the Disney+ app. We all knew it was coming once Disney bought Fox and secured a stranglehold of ownership on a streaming platform that was pretty much a competitor to the streaming platform they just launched. With Comcast’s share expiring at the end of the year, nothing is holding the Mouse House back from finalizing said merge and it looks like the ripples begin soon. Talk is that “Hulu” will become a tile on Disney+ much like Marvel and Star Wars are now. To me that means it will probably only house Hulu original content, so whether FX and other Disney-controlled entities remain is yet to be disclosed. So too is live TV capabilities of the competition: namely NBC and CBS. I wonder what that means for 20th Century Studios (the old 20th Century Fox). Most if not all their titles have gone directly to Hulu as “originals” with the 20th Century logo—confusing and overboard. Will they soon be heading back to theaters? Hybridizing like Searchlight where some go theatrical (CHEVALIER) and others don’t (FLAMIN’ HOT)? Or are they just wholly synonymous with Hulu moving forward? I guess none of it really matters. Disney will probably just do whatever they think will net the best profit on a case-by-case basis. You can’t change an industry by embracing the status quo. It’s something every upstart knows and every billionaire forgets. And it’s a truth that’s never been more prevalent than right now with an astronomical wealth disparity increased during a pandemic as everyone with means profited off the desperation of those left to die. That’s why my favorite part of Ben Affleck’s AIR is when Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon) basically tells Nike CEO Phil Knight (Affleck) that he never should have gone public. That the payday effectively castrated him as far as being able to roll the dice and take a risk due to Wall Street’s grip squeezing him into a sure-thing conservative mentality. A mentality that exemplifies everything that’s wrong with the world today. Art, beauty, and progress usurped by commerce and greed, homogenized into nondescript soylent that the masses begrudgingly consume while the one-percent crushes them for another meaningless percentage point. It’s the lone moment in Alex Convery’s script where you wonder if this thing might be more subversive than the rubber-stamped mythologizing of a corporation the trailers correctly sell. That doesn’t mean it’s not entertaining, though. Nor that it’s not good. Affleck has created a bona fide crowd pleaser that has as much fun with the audience as it does the real-life people portrayed. That includes Knight too with jokes at his expense via a faux Buddhist, awkwardly self-conscious yet woefully egotistical persona Affleck knocks out of the park—an image that surely went down easier with the addition of an epilogue slide reductively glorifying him as a saint who donated two billion dollars to charity during his lifetime (only .04% of his current net worth let alone the billions spent along the way). But that’s the game you must play to get projects like this off the ground. And it’s worth it to give the Sonnys, Rob Strassers (Jason Bateman), Peter Moores (Matthew Maher), and Deloris Jordans (Viola Davis) of the world their due. A majority of the film takes place over the weekend Nike is given to pitch Michael Jordan despite the company’s abysmal basketball shoe division (rumors of being dissolved travel around the office) and the player wanting nothing to do with them (Adidas is his first choice with Converse the only legitimate alternative). Only after Sonny stakes his reputation on a hope and prayer by going completely off-book to secure that meeting (much to Chris Messina’s David Falk’s chagrin as Jordan’s foul-mouthed agent) does Knight let him start planning an actual design and campaign. It’s then that Damon and Bateman inject some heart and soul into what had been a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants comic powerhouse of big personalities and bottomless sarcasm. I would have liked a bit more MAD MEN-esque inside baseball, but this isn’t a long-form drama. It’s a breezy adventure of blue-collar gumption that does well to forget it literally exists inside a white-collar package. The acting is top-notch across the board with Davis stealing the show despite her character only really driving two scenes (with Sonny at home at the beginning and on the phone at the end). Damon is the perfect straight man throughout, always outwaiting and provoking his more manic scene partners (Affleck, Bateman, and especially Messina). I could have done without all the needle drops—a couple lead into another music cue before the scene even changes—but I can’t deny the soundtrack isn’t phenomenal removed from that usage. And the attention to detail with wall-to-wall nostalgia bombs via product placement and pop culture really brings the entire production home. Because it’s not about Jordan (he’s always missing or cropped off-screen) or even Nike. No, it’s instead a period-specific workplace comedy about taking ownership in yourself and demanding your worth even if those things are mostly glossed over as concessions rather than victories. What if STAR WARS … but Marvel? That’s what director Peyton Reed, screenwriter Jeff Loveness, and MCU head Kevin Feige seem to have asked themselves when brainstorming ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA. Because it is literally just STAR WARS. Stormtroopers doing the bidding of a dark lord. Cantinas populated by alien creatures. There’s even a bit of “the Force” in how Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) fights courtesy of an exosuit light years beyond Earth’s own capabilities. Call Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) Obi Wan Kenobi as she dresses Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and Hank (Michael Douglas) in desert clothing and let her exposition dump the origin of a new enemy—an enemy that actually might be fighting against the actual enemy. Because this Kang isn’t the worst Kang. He’s an exile. He’s destroying worlds to destroy himself. So, killing him might end up guaranteeing extinction rather than staving it off. But that’s getting ahead of ourselves. That’s for another chapter years from now. Scott Lang’s (Paul Rudd) latest adventure into cartoon land is simply our introduction to a new galaxy beneath the surface of our own, similar to the old galaxies traveled by the Guardians above. This is where we glean a bit more about what He Who Remains said to Loki and Sylvie at the end of LOKI season one. How the Kangs ravaging the multiverse have labeled this “Exiled One” a threat, banishing him to the Quantum Realm because it is a world outside of space and time. Unfortunately for humanity, however, it’s also a world Scott’s daughter Cassie (recast as Kathryn Newton) is keenly interested in discovering with the help of Hope and Hank. And since Janet still hasn’t shared the trauma of her thirty years trapped within it, they don’t realize the ramifications of trying to connect. At the center of the journey lies the common theme of “Just because it’s not happening to you doesn’t mean it’s not happening.” Cassie says those words to her father because she believes his desire to live life basking in the glory of victories only shows he never actually cared about the meaning of those victories. That he fought to save himself and those close to him instead of fighting to save everything. That leads into story threads of rebellion (see STAR WARS again) and the duality of hero/villain when it comes to one man’s freedom fighter being another man’s terrorist. Does Reed and company delve into the psychology of that dynamic? No. It’s merely one superficial part of a fantasy film for kids with jokes about how many holes humans have in comparison to aliens. It’s a two-hour-long computer-generated video game that stays afloat because of two things: Rudd’s comic timing and Majors’ acting clinic. It’s just too bad that an end stinger featuring Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Mobius (Owen Wilson) gazing upon a benign version of Kang with the latter quizzically wondering how he could be a monster has bled into real life with the soft-spoken and introspective Majors being revealed as a violent abuser himself. Will he be recast like Terrence Howard? Who knows? His team has already started damage control with stories of new love as potential payouts to old loves quiet the storm, so Disney might just hope it all blows over before a decision is necessary—much like DC has with Ezra Miller as Flash. It’s a sad state of affairs and one that admittedly is in its “allegations” faze, but you can’t pick and choose which victims you listen to because you like the alleged abuser’s art. So, Majors inclusion will taint the experience even as his craft lifts it up. Because without him, it’s all a low stakes affair that occurs in a realm that Feige could choose to never visit again. Katy M. O'Brian and William Jackson Harper do well in small roles as Quantum natives, but who they are and their place in the grander scheme of the MCU is nonexistent beyond this chapter … at least for now. Maybe that will change. Maybe this whole exercise was for Scott and company to learn about Kang and pass along the information to the rest of the Avengers once other Kangs begin to descend upon Earth. This latest phase is still in its infancy, after all. It’s still opening doors to new pathways and tying off loose threads to close others. Our enjoyment is therefore solely reliant upon the characters in front of us and the ones surrounding Ant-Man are at least fun to follow regardless of how hollow the plot they’re in might prove. The press notes for Paul Schrader’s MASTER GARDENER make it seem as though his process of writing the script was akin to Mad Libs. It talks about how everything started with the idea of gardening—a juicy metaphor he could wield in different ways later. And deciding to stick to his “man in a room” concept, said gardener would have to be a loner. A recluse. Why? Enter the idea of witness protection. Okay. Interesting. He’s living quietly in hiding, an informer trying to stay alive and perhaps redeem himself from the deeds of his past. Why? What horrible things did he do? The lightbulb snaps above Schrader’s head: white supremacist gun-for-hire. Of course! Why wouldn’t one’s mind gravitate there? No one ever accused Schrader of being non-confrontational or non-controversial. It is a captivating premise. That’s not the problem—despite my obvious sarcasm. The problem lies in where he takes it. Because this isn’t actually a redemption story. We don’t care about Narvel Roth (Joel Edgerton) enough to let it be one. This is a story solely about race and how Schrader can use it to manipulate his characters into acting in the most outrageous ways possible under the guise of believing liberalism and political correctness is solely about blind forgiveness. He makes it so the estate where Narvel has reinvented himself as a gardener is a colonial plantation stewarded by a racist dowager (Sigourney Weaver’s Norma Haverhill) whose kink is gazing upon his swastika tattoos. And he introduces a much younger woman to drive a wedge into their idyllic if warped existence by way of Norma’s “mixed blood” great niece Maya (Quintessa Swindell). You couldn’t render MASTER GARDENER riper for ill-conceived social commentary if you tried with the addition of drugs, abuse, and romance in ways Schrader intentionally wields to augment our “unease”. None of it made me feel anything other than tickled by just how silly it all played out, though. I honestly thought everything would rewind to show the final half of the film was a delusional fantasy of a bad man who thinks he can be saved only to discover the harsh reality that actions have consequences. And if you’ve seen the filmmaker’s last two works (FIRST REFORMED and THE CARD COUNTER), that assumption would be the odds-on favorite to come to fruition. The most controversial aspect of the whole is thus Schrader’s left-field decision to reject impulse and do the opposite: providing a finish that’s even sillier than the journey taken to experience it. Because he doesn’t even try to approach the psychology of what he’s created. It’s literally all for kicks. The overwrought voiceover. The two-second wrestling matches over morality that end with “but I really want to take my clothes off” energy. There’s a missed opportunity here to have played it all intentionally as a comedy because it surely doesn’t work as a drama. Two dimensional pawns in an artist’s superficially drawn exercise of racial taboo can’t possess gravitas. So, do yourself a favor and lean into the cartoonish one-eighties and textbook “civility” of empowered bigots exploiting everyone and everything for their personal pleasure. Laugh at it all as a farcical satire of Schrader’s last two films even if the marketing push says it’s been made in earnest. Otherwise, you’ll be wondering what it was you just watched like me. Who knows? Maybe it’s all FIRST REFORMED and THE CARD COUNTER's fault for being too good. In great DIY fashion over three-plus years with his daughter as the lead and one hundred thousand feet of expired 35mm film stock at his disposal, Ryan Stevens Harris’ MOON GARDEN was born. The dark fantasy unfolds through the imaginatively comatose mind of a young girl named Emma (Haven Lee Harris), desperate to escape the escalating turmoil at home courtesy of her parents’ fracturing marriage. Happy memories mix with sad inside her dreams as Mom (Augie Duke’s Sara) and Dad’s (Brionne Davis’ Alex) voices can be heard on a faltering transistor radio, reality placing the couple near their unconscious child’s hospital bed after a fall sparked by their latest quarrel. They plead for her to come back as Emma does everything possible to comply despite a monster born from bad feelings (Morgana Ignis’s Teeth) stalking behind, lapping up her fallen tears. Think a sinister ALICE IN WONDERLAND by way of A MONSTER CALLS where grief and frustration are weighing young Emma down to the point where her body realizes that waking up may be too dangerous a proposition. Odd characters arrive for nightmarish dinner parties (Timothy Lee DePriest’s Groom) and blood-drenched nursery rhymes (told by Emily Meister), their weaknesses born from the good times of years past when Mom and Dad weren’t constantly blaming each other for their own unhappiness. It becomes a war of attrition in some regards as Emma learns to recognize that there was enough good to cancel out the bad even if none of it has ever been hers to shoulder. Not that blame has ever stopped a child from believing he/she was the problem nor parents from thinking a child could be the answer to theirs. I’d love to see a different version this film delving deeper into that truth. As it is now, MOON GARDEN (despite its sometimes-terrifying visuals) is a kid’s movie that wears its earnest desire for happily ever after on its sleeve. By putting Emma in the lead, it takes the onus off Sara and Alex by positing a tragedy such as losing their only child could magically fix everything that’s wrong with their relationship. All those months where they refused to truly listen to each other erased because of a shared love even though those good memories (pre-beard for Alex) reveal that adoring Emma failed to prove enough once already. Perhaps this says more about me than the film, but I found a lot of it to be as hollow as the main villain (a nicely conceived metaphor by Harris) since nothing Emma does within her mind can truly fix anything. We’re instead watching a little girl torture herself at the hands of two self-involved adults in woeful need of therapy. This is why I think A MONSTER CALLS is such a fantastic film. The horrors its lead must endure are outside of his control too, but he’s augmented them by denial. He’s the reason they’ve become so insurmountably potent. That’s not the case here since Emma is too young to even fully grasp what’s happening beyond the purely emotional intuition that something is very, very wrong. Her adventure is thus less about catharsis than it is about acceptance. Rather than running away from or fighting back against her monsters, the lesson here is to admit that they can’t actually hurt her. Translating that to the real world is wonky since it says that her parents (the monsters causing her so much strife now) can’t either. That only tells me they already have. They’ve caused her so much pain that she’s become numb to their chaos. So, while visually gorgeous in its commendable, if incomplete, message about the power of “healing”, the smiles at the end feel more like resignation to me. Director Dominik Moll and co-writer Gilles Marchand lay it out right at the beginning of their seven-time César-winning film THE NIGHT OF THE 12TH. The text on-screen explains that out of approximately eight hundred murder cases opened by French police a year, nearly twenty percent remain unsolved. And rather than simply provide a dire statistic, they quickly contextualize it by saying this film, (based on a story within Pauline Guéna’s novel 18.3 - A Year With the Crime Squad), is one of that twenty percent. So, we instantly know that newly minted captain Yohan Vivès (Bastien Bouillon) is never going to capture his man. The figure in a ski mask who says Clara’s (Lula Cotton-Frapier) name before dousing her with accelerant and lighting her on fire will never be identified. This police procedural isn’t therefore about justice or heroism or even violence. At least not any of them isolated from the others. It’s a look at the human condition and its tragic flirtation with futility. All the potential suspects become provocations as a result. Fate laughing in the faces of Yohan, Marceau (Bouli Lanners), and the other officers in their precinct. They want to crack this case so badly that they’ll float the notion of false alibis to put away known abusers for the crime. They’ll even go so far as to lose sight of their purpose by projecting blame upon the victim due to having no perpetrator to carry the load. It leads to many introspective and important conversations wherein vulnerability is laid bare. Sometimes they are wholly relevant to the case (Clara’s best friend, Pauline Serieys’ Nanie, calling out the destructiveness of Yohan’s line of questioning despite his intentions being pure) and sometimes completely removed from it (Marceau pouring out his soul about love and loss). Every new lead becomes a trigger flipping emotional and psychological switches alike that push these detectives into the dark corners of their own inadequacies. Moll’s film is thus composed of unanswerable questions. It’s populated by short vignettes of men and women finding themselves thrust into awkward situations wherein artifice and conditioning disappear. Marceau knows he can’t jeopardize the case with his own unchecked violence, but he does so anyway. Jules Leroy (Jules Porier) knows he’s a suspect in the investigation and yet he cannot stop himself from bursting out laughing during his interrogation. You have Yohan constantly trying to burn off his anxieties and frustrations by biking on a velodrome—a literal loop without an exit. Rookies talk about marriage while the grizzled veterans relay cynical outlooks about the fallacy of romance. And it’s always the women (Nanie at the beginning and Mouna Soualem’s Nadia and Anouk Grinberg’s judge at the end) reminding the men that their newfound confusion about the breakdown between men and women isn’t new to them since they’re generally the ones left dead. While proving to be a downer in many respects due to its characters spinning their wheels without getting anywhere, THE NIGHT OF THE 12TH is not without its subtle inspirations. Because eliminating suspects is just as important as finding them. Not letting oneself buckle under the pressure of such nightmarish realities only to become a part of their horror also can’t be undervalued—especially when you consider how meaningless a Venn diagram of policemen and criminals is in America (Nadia’s question about it being “weird that most crimes are committed by men yet society sends mostly men to solve them” hits home considering that dynamic is a function here rather than a flaw so US cops can get themselves out of trouble). There’s a reason Yohan is both a Boy Scout and alone. Some lose their compass to uphold the law. Others lose the ability to shut it off and live. All are fallible. All are haunted by the mistakes they don’t even know they’re making. It’s unavoidable since the alternative’s indifference is unacceptable. Of all the revelations made in Allison Otto’s documentary THE THIEF COLLECTOR—from the obvious (southern philistines in cowboy hats saying they wouldn’t pay five dollars for a de Kooning painting) to the sinister (potential bodies buried beneath the Alters’ property) to the insane (a speech pathologist and music teacher stealing famous artwork for decades without anyone knowing)—the wildest thing to me is just how lazy and/or indifferent institutions like Sotheby’s and the Metropolitan Museum of Art are to donation/sale inquiries by unknown private citizens. That’s not to say they should spend exorbitant resources to research every worthless piece of ephemera from every estate sale in the world. But to just swipe left on the photos Ron Roseman sent without asking for more information is astounding once you discover exactly what was ignored. It’s all about presentation, though. Ron couldn’t know he had anything special because his aunt and uncle never told anyone they owned anything special. So, if he’s just sending random photos without any background for legitimacy’s sake, it suddenly becomes easy to believe an overworked associate fielding hundreds of inquiries by people hoping for a miracle every day/week/etc. would barely give Ron’s a glance. That’s where coincidence and fate come in. Where strangers just passing by see something odd and spark a more specific line of questioning as far as authenticity and value are concerned. A seeming joke leads to internet searches. Uncertain phone calls lead to FBI investigators. And a poorly written collection of short stories becomes a potential series of confessions about an increasingly plausible pattern of escalating crimes. Because Jerry and Rita Alter (performed in comedic re-enactments by Glenn Howerton and Sarah Minnich respectively) shouldn’t have been able to hang Willem de Kooning’s “Woman-Ochre” on their bedroom wall. They probably shouldn’t have been able to travel to exotic locales three times a year annually either, but we’re trained to not question such things. Maybe they came from money (because their salaries surely weren’t enough). Maybe they just knew where to find great deals. No one automatically thinks larceny. Not when peering at these two smiling lovebirds sharing their slideshows and souvenirs. People aspired to have what they had. Jerry and Rita were a nice wholesome couple to all but a handful of those with a bit more intimate knowledge about those trips. And if they’re willing to not be flashy about their crimes, why look any deeper? It’s a shame no one did—both for the sake of the law and the film. This is an utterly transfixing story told with an infectious tone, but it’s about 80% speculation. And while that speculation is fun, the whole can feel like spinning wheels for long passages with Ron, his son, the antique dealers who found the de Kooning, and multiple law enforcement agents all just saying the same things: “Could they have? I guess they could!” Every revelation is therefore hearsay. Every new road forward is a dead end towards a smirk and a shrug by people who believe the hypotheses and yet can do nothing about them. That too is interesting; that the Alters were good enough to remain “innocent” now since no one knows how anything got into their possession (maybe the thieves duped them). But the film comes from a premise of “gotcha” without being able to actually say it (despite constantly pretending it can). It’s entertaining yet incomplete. “It's the age-old conundrum: are evil deeds truly sinful if they are performed in the name of God? Who's to say [Catholics] haven't been fooled by the Devil since the first words of the Bible were written down?” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “While it would be easy to dismiss the package in which these interviews and recordings arrive as conventional, the subject matter can't help but elevate the material beyond our objectivity too.” – Full thoughts at The Film Stage. “Giving Birth to a Butterfly becomes a road trip poem of its own reminding us that it's okay to stop, recalibrate, and change evolutionary course.” – Full thoughts at The Film Stage. “Add the authentic love shared by Kansara and Arya and it's tough not to come aboard for a madcap adventure that cements Manzoor's talent as someone worth following.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “It's a tense affair that ultimately puts Matthias in the middle to finally pick a side, culminating in an unforgettable night-time conclusion that brings everything full circle to reveal the thing we truly fear is us.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “The juxtaposition [of the filmmakers' ideas with police procedural plotting] isn't perfect, but their ability to let their characters be flawed and complex does allow our normal preconceptions born from Hollywood copaganda to get pushed aside.” – Full thoughts at HHYS."
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Fifteen years ago Marvel Studios began a long-term, theatrical venture that became known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe  - the MCU for short.  Up and running with the release of Iron Man, Marvel Studios not only gave superhero films a boost but reinvigorated Robert Downey Jr.'s (Sherlock Holmes) career. Over the next ten years, and two ""phases"" the world was (re) introduced to Captain America, Black Widow, The Hulk, Thor, Loki, and a host of other heroes and villains. This year the release of Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania,  ushered in phase five of the franchise, set off into the multiverse, and brought in a new villain named Kang the Conqueror (Johnathan Majors; Creed III). After Thanos (Josh Brolin; No Country for Old Men) was defeated, the van Dynes, Pyms, and the Langs enjoyed a quiet existence until Cassie (Kathryn Newton; Freaky) reveals she has been working on a device that can make contact with the Quantum Realm. Unfortunately, before Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer; Batman Returns) can shut it down the device reaches its target, and a portal is opened, sucking the five of them into the Quantum Realm.  While Cassie and Scott are found by rebels, the Pym/van Dyne party explores a city in the Realm.  Surprised to see Janet has returned, the inhabitants update her on Kang. She then reveals who Kang is and why he is so dangerous. The cast is largely the same with the addition of Majors, Newton, and Billy Murray (Lost in Translation) in an extended cameo, and while Majors is an excellent actor and well cast as Kang, it will be interesting to see how Marvel will proceed based on his recent legal issues.  They could recast and simply blame it on being in a different realm of the multiverse but that could lead to inconsistency.  Newton, however, is a star on the rise and hopefully, she will be part of the MCU for a few more phases. The 2160p resolution is excellent and enhances the picture quality, which can be good and bad.  Colors are bright and vivid and details are sharp.  However, since some of the special effects look fake, the higher quality emphasizes the flaws even more.  The Dolby Atmos audio is standard fare for Marvel which is slightly disappointing. Their tracks are plentiful yet not especially robust.  Surround sound and ambient noises are fine but don't necessarily stand out either in a good or bad way.  It seems Marvel chooses to spend their budget more on cast and visuals than on audio. Visually, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is incredible with precise details and colors exploding everywhere on screen.  The audio isn't quite as strong as the video but it is livable.  The story does what it is supposed to do which is open up the multiverse for additional Marvel stories.  However, if you were looking for the fun, joking Ant-Man/Scott Lang from the original movie, you won't find very much of him here. It seems from the end of phase four to the beginning of phase five, everything has turned upside down.  Thor became the buffoon and butt of the jokes in the MCU, while Scott Lang turned very serious.  It will be interesting to see where the MCU goes with this new direction but, so far, it isn't impressive.

"May 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Be thankful you didn&apos;t squander your money at the box-office&#33; This atrocious escapade is one of the most worthless entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#46;
"Apr 23, 2023",POSITIVE," Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd, left), his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton, center), and fellow superhero Hope van Dyne, known as The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), face a new enemy in the subatomic “quantum realm,” in the Marvel Cinematic Universe installment “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania.” (Photo courtesy of Marvel Studios.) Life is pretty good for Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), the ex-con and now hero because of his work helping to save the world as Ant-Man, part of The Avengers group who saved half of humanity and defeated Thanos. Now he’s settled down to a calm life with girlfriend, fellow superhero and philanthropist Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). Occasionally Scott has to bail his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) out of jail for acts of civil disobedience, and endure Cassie’s criticism that her dad has quit caring about helping people. Cassie, aided by Hope and Hope’s inventor father Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), has been experimenting with creating a device to survey the subatomic universe called the “quantum realm.” When Hank’s wife, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), realizes Cassie’s device involves sending a signal into the quantum realm, she tells her to turn it off — but not before the device springs to life and starts sucking all the lab equipment, Hank’s ant farm, and eventually the five of them down into the subatomic. Scott and Cassie get separated from the rest, and end up with a group of rebels trying to avoid the oppressive leader of this realm. Hope, Hank and Janet end up elsewhere, with Janet — who spent 30 years in the quantum realm (this was covered in 2018’s “Ant-Man and The Wasp”) — keeping secrets about why she’s so scared of returning. Janet leads Hope and Hank through the seedier elements of this place, which mostly involves a not-so-pleasant few minutes with a local scoundrel played by Bill Murray. Director Peyton Reed, now on his third movie with “Ant-Man” in the title, knows not to take this bug-themed superhero stuff too seriously. That’s why the rebels include a guy made entirely of goo, and another a telepath (William Jackson Harper, from “The Good Place”) who’s clearly annoyed by what people always think about. And it’s why Kang has a subordinate villain, straight out of Marvel canon, whose reveal is pretty hilarious. The screenplay, the first produced feature script by “Rick & Morty” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” writer Jeff Loveness, has some funny bits, along with gaps in its credulity that aren’t papered over by saying “it’s the quantum realm — the rules are different here.” Still, the plot gives plenty of chances for Rudd’s easygoing charm to win us over, and to give the supporting players — especially Pfeiffer — room to shine. The most intriguing thing about “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” is Majors as Kang — who, we already know from his appearance in Marvel’s series “Loki” and in promises from Marvel Uber-producer Kevin Feige, is going to be the big bad guy for several movies to come. Based on the evidence here, he will be someone worth following through this new phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Apr 19, 2023",NEGATIVE," The Gist: The setting: The Quantum Realm, a subatomic inner-space world. You know, the place where Michelle Pfeiffer’s character Janet van Dyne, wife of Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and mother of Hope van Dyne/the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), was trapped for 30 years, something you should remember from the previous Ant-Man movies, but in case you forgot, it’s sorta recapped here. Anyway, Janet meanders the weirdscape and ends up meeting and befriending and fighting monsters with a guy who we already know is Kang (Majors), but importantly, she doesn’t yet know he’s a multidimensional genocidal maniac who’s murdered entire timelines of life in the multiverse, so he seems like a decent fellow at first. We’ll eventually learn it’s her fault that Kang is trapped in the Quantum Realm – she busted his doohickey, no, not that one, but a different one that’s not attached – and now squashing its denizens under his fascist thumb.  But Janet isn’t there anymore. She’s back on Earth, where Scott Lang (Rudd) uses his celeb-Avenger status to hawk his corny memoir, titled Look Out for the Little Guy. His heroism has rubbed off on teen daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who’s a social activist who’s not afraid to get arrested for protesting injustices. The two of them are having dinner with Janet and Hank and Hope, during which Janet reveals nothing, because she just won’t talk about what happened in the Quantum Realm; someone call Dr. Melfi, please? Cassie reveals that she’s been fiddling around with quantum-this and -that, and even has her own Ant-Man-style suit, and before Scott can get all parental and object to such dangerous things, kerfloosh, they’re all sucked into the Quantum Realm, because someone apparently pressed the wrong thingamajig. Don’t you HATE it when that happens? You should! Note that from here on out, the whole movie is basically a CGI version of the cantina scene from Star Wars, which was great because it was full of strange and colorful aliens, and also because it doesn’t wear us out by being, like, 100 minutes long. When our five principals land, they’re split up. Scott and Cassie encounter a group of rebels resisting Kang’s rule; their leader is the warrior Jentorra (Katy O’Brian, who you’ll recognize from The Mandalorian). Janet, Hank and Hope meet up with Janet’s apparent former flame, Krylar (Bill Murray), who fills them in on all the horrible crap that’s been happening since she went back home. Turns out that the shrink-o tech Hank invented is just what Kang needs to repair his doohickey, cuz it just so happens that the reverse-shrink-o tech is what Janet used to destroy it. So Kang gonna get it – preferably the shrink-o tech, although anyone invested in this blither hopes Kang gets it before he has a chance to get it, if you catch my drift.  What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: How Quantumania scored lower with critics than drab crudfest Thor: The Dark World (or even the irritating Thor: Love and Thunder) is beyond me. Not that it’s terrible – it’s like a more poorly visually and comedically calculated Guardians of the Galaxy. And for a minute there I wondered if Osmosis Jones might be a surprise new MCU character, since he’s pretty small too, and he also finds himself in a reality that’s a wacky-ass cartoon. I guess they’re different realities, though.  Our Take: MCU fatigue is real – we’re on movie no. 31, you know – and even if you haven’t felt it yet, Quantumania may inspire its emergence. It’s easy to admire director Peyton Reed’s attempt to whole-cloth concoct a batshit strange-but-beautiful alien reality, but it’s such an overwhelming and all-encompassing CGI onslaught, it’s a struggle to find the visual reference points we need to stave off disorientation. And yet, the general color-drenched too-muchness of it all might be tolerable if the plot wasn’t such a by-the-numbers slog, alternating hyperkinetic action sequences with draggy recitations of exposition – you get the sense that Pfeiffer, ever the pro, is all but reciting deadly, leaden lines like “through the void and subatomica, a place outside time and space, it’s a secret universe beneath ours” phonetically.  And even then, if the comedy was more hit than whiff, we’d forgive the movie for its stumbles. Bill Murray does his Bill Murray thing, his usual enthusiasm seemingly dampened by his assimilation into the MCU Borg. Rudd smirks earnestly as he did in previous Ant-Mans, but the light touch of those movies is buried in the rubble here. And then there’s the MODOK character, a floating head with tiny arms and legs (played by Corey Stoll) who’s Kang’s right-hand man, and pegs the Ant-Man movies’ goofy quotient so deeply into the realm of eyeball-exploding uncanny-valley abominations, we can only shake our heads at its bewildering stupidity. I understand the need to balance the dramatic weight of the introduction of a villain who’s slaughtered TRILLIONS of life forms with insane shit like MODOK, but such forced peculiarity is just as burdensome as Kang’s dull-ass speeches. Hats off to Majors for finding a way to leaven the character with some charisma, even though the movie doesn’t have much room for such things; he’s got to do something of import, lest this villain not have the desired ripple effect necessary to build drama for MCU movies to come. Then again, when Kang inevitably faces off against Ant-Man at the end, it’s essentially a boxing match, yet another reason why the ungainly and annoying Quantumania pretty much sucks.  Our Call: THE MCU BORG OBLIGATES YOU TO WATCH ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA LEST YOU FALL INTO A CONTINUITY HOLE, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN. But I’m here to remind you that you needn’t fall victim to such psychological manipulations. SKIP IT and you’ll be fine, promise!"
"Apr 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," Paul Rudd has consistently been an entertaining comedy feature in the Ant-Man and the Wasp and Avengers films, and he continues to bring the charm here. Some of the visual effects are stellar and some are jarringly amateurish. Though the movie is making waves at the box office, this will play just fine at home in the eventual upload to Disney+ in a few months. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the first film in Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase V, is an easy watch, but it does not offer anything truly remarkable. Although the film has a fantastic villain in Kang (Jonathan Majors) and a story that balances humor and science-fiction action, it feels like a movie that exists because it has to. Despite good performances from Majors, Michelle Pfeiffer, and the nice chemistry developed between Paul Rudd and Kathryn Newton, the movie feels perfunctory and unremarkable. While watching it, you never feel all that excited, and the movie seems to go through its steps, knowing you'll buy your ticket and/or eventually stream it on Disney+.Quantumania, the third film in the Ant-Man and the Wasp series, picks up from the aftereffects of Avengers: Endgame and draws inspiration from another Disney-owned product that conducts its wars in the stars. As those familiar with the Ant-Man films know, Janet van Dyne (Pfeiffer) was exiled for three decades in the Quantum Realm, returned and rescued by her family. Scott Lang (Rudd), our proverbial “Ant-Man,” and member of the Avengers, continues to do what he can to save all of humanity alongside girlfriend Hope (Evangeline Lilly), daughter to Janet and her quantum physicist husband Hank (Michael Douglas).At the beginning of the movie, Scott has written a best-selling memoir about his experiences ""saving the world,"" and Hope is running her father’s Pym Industries, utilizing subatomic particles in practical ways - those same particles that allow Scott to reduce and grow in size and strength. Now 18, Scott's daughter Cassie (Newton) stirs up trouble as an activist but has also has an interest in the family business. One evening, she proudly shows everyone that she has found a way to send a signal back into the Quantum Realm. Janet understandably panics. And despite shutting off the device, a signal has been activated and the Langs, the van Dynes, and Hank Pym are sucked back down into the place Janet desperately wanted to avoid.Once in the Quantum Realm, Janet reveals an encounter she had with a traveler named Kang, a man she helped and assisted, only to learn of his malevolent intent and demeanor. Kang now rules the Quantum Realm and wants out. Battle lines are drawn. And, yet again, mankind needs saving.

Kang now rules the Quantum Realm and wants out. Battle lines are drawn. And, yet again, mankind needs saving. This time around, outside of Kang, Quantumania offers nothing that pushes the envelope forward with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There’s a distinct lack of much here to make an audience intrigued for what's to come in this new Phase. Majors' steady, slow, seething intensity sets him apart from previous villains who have used charm and larger-than-life performances in the MCU, but he can only do so much. The Quantum Realm environment is staffed with an array of creatures and creations, some influenced by steampunk design and others that look like a child's creation. The visual effects work is largely solid, but there are indeed some jarring looks to the film, such as the much-maligned look of M.O.D.O.K., the latest version of Scott's former protege, Darren (Corey Stoll).The film's introduction of variants, references to the multiverse, and other elements will please the most dedicated of Marvel viewers. Throughout the journey to Quantumania, I found myself detached, watching events unfold. Everything felt rehashed, though this particular story had not yet been told. The mid-credits scenes (no spoilers) again bind viewers to Marvel’s cinematic and television properties in ways most casual viewers will never fully grasp or have time to consume.In the end, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is not a bad movie, but it feels like it spins its wheels, runs through the motions, and fills two hours of time. There's some humor, a great villain, decent visuals, and a great score from Christophe Beck. For some, that's enough.

"Mar 24, 2023",NEGATIVE," Forever behind, always catching up. Herewith two spontaneous reviews of threequels that came out during Oscar madness that we never got around to talking about (as they weren't related to that all-consuming golden season): Marvel's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Steven Soderbergh's trilogy-closing Magic Mike's Last Dance... Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania Pfans rejoice - Michelle Pfeiffer gets a much larger role in this third ""episode"" of the franchise and we promise to talk about her once the movie comes to Disney+ and is available for screenshotting. Pfeiffer excepted, the third installment is a major letdown. The problems are many but they began quickly. Strangely, despite the reunion of the old team, the movie promptly forgets that this particular franchise is endearing largely because it eschews the 'end of the world' enormity of the other Marvel films and shrinks down to human size (or less). This one also doesn't feel like a movie at all but a barely shaped Disney+ miniseries that you happen to be bingeing in a movie theater. The strangest problem given Marvel's previous faith that audiences would be with them through everything -- is that it holds your hand at every possible plot point indicating that the story isn't over yet. See, if you defeat a villain it doesn't mean you've won. Duh!  Magic Mike's Last Dance The title is wistful, reminding audiences with finality, of what an enchanting screen character Channing Tatum's furniture-making stripper has been. But, surprise surprise, Salma Hayek completely steals this particular dance. She's too three-dimensional to be a manic pixie dream girl but she does have a dream (to share Mike's Magic with the world) and she is certainly manic. Her character, an obscenely wealthy soon-to-be divorced woman, is a swirling nightmare mix of emotional avoidance, entitlement, short-attention spans, loneliness and horniness... and yet her maddening behavior is somehow endearing! It's an electric but accidental reminder that we seldom see big stars appearing ""hungry"" onscreen. That vibe is usually reserved for actors of lesser fame when they've landed a role they clearly believe is their ticket to stardom and they're going to leave everything onscreen. Ant-Man and the Wasp:  Quantumania is likely to be a film I don't think I will revisit as it was just all over the place.  There were things I liked about it like Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer but it lacked the humor and heart of its predecessors.  Plus, I really missed some of the minor characters from those 2 films. MAGIC MIKE 3 is one of the biggest disappointments I ever experienced as a movie. Where to start? The London re-location was under-utilized (we were mostly inside a generic mansion apartment or an old musty theatre), the divorce plotline took up way too much time without threading any new ground, the voice over narration was peak cringe and, most egregious, isolating Mike from his buddies eliminated the bro-bonding the first 2 movies perfected. That last part could've been ameliorated somewhat if they made the new dancers have personalities but they couldn't even give them actual dialogue. A truly perplexing choice. And as a trilogy ender, it did Mike a huge disservice. His arc here was basically being swept away from his home/friends for a rich lady's divorce revenge fantasy. His character was oddly passive for most of it. A limp end to his growth and journey in my opinion. The biggest problem with  Quantumania is that taking the film out of the real world/SF really limited some of the fun they were able to have with ant-man's powers. Tonally, it felt different than the first two outings, and was a step down.  With that being said, I thought the film was compelling enough and a fun time at the theatre. It wasn't perfect, but I thought it checked all the boxes that a blockbuster should. The best part was getting Michelle Pfeiffer in full movie-star mode. She's essentially the second lead of the film, and she gives a really great star performance. Her scenes with Jonathan Majors really works, and I hope that as they dig deeper into these stories, especially in some of the team-up films, she gets to play a somewhat central role in resolving the Kang saga. I also really liked Jonathan Majors here too, probably more than most. ANT-MAN is barely above MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS as the absolute worst of the MCU's entire catalogue. Just appalling. Ghastly to look at, not a moment of sincerity going by without a quip or snarky one-liner, boring in how transparent it is as just another entry and a prologue to something bigger including a tv show and another movie. I didn't even like Majors or Pfeiffer. MODOK is perhaps the ugliest single work of vfx i have ever seen in a movie. I never hope for any movie to be bad, but I have to admit I am at least somewhat relieved that even most Marvel fans seem to be cooling down on the franchise in its current phase simply because I want to see a lot more variety in blockbuster filmmaking than we’ve gotten over the past decade. I’m definitely not hopeful that superhero movies are on their way out, but if the MCU installments keep underwhelming, maybe Disney will back down from their “house style” approach and give the directors they hire a bit more creative control (at least stylistically…I understand the shared universe concept inherently limits the amount of narrative control each contributor has).  And also on a more petty level, it is refreshing to not have all my coworkers go on about how I “need” to see the latest MCU product every time a new one comes out, each time insisting, “You don’t need to like the whole franchise to enjoy THIS one though.” I haven’t heard that in a while now. @Nathaniel, I'm curious, since you mentioned it, what do you think represent examples of lesser-known actors who threw it all in when they got a 'ticket to stardom' role? And any other examples of proper stars giving a charismatic 'hungry' performance like Salma seems to do here? I also think of Faye Dunaway in Bonnie and Clyde as a great example. You get the sense that she's pouring everything into that role, even while being very precise. Before that role, she'd just had two supporting roles. "
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE," Not trying to be mean. Just shocked, and delighted, that a character so perfectly comic-booky and so far from the metaphorical marquee has carried three multimillion-dollar blockbusters. In this installment of the franchise, Ant-Man, aka Scott Lang (Rudd), has settled into his life as a world-renowned, Thanos-quashing Avenger, which is a far cry from his previous life as an ex-con ne’er-do-well. He’s on a book tour. He’s formed a partnership in every sense of the word with Hope van Dyne, aka the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly). They’ve even got a very weird family going, including Hope’s ex-superhero parents Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne (Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer) and Scott’s socially conscious, genius daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton). This family’s idea of a bonding activity is strange, too: Cassie and Hank have developed a method of remotely exploring the Quantum Realm, the subatomic universe where Scott’s spent some time and Janet was stuck for 30 years. As it turns out, more happened down there than a horrified Janet has let on, which becomes apparent when the whole family is sucked down to the Quantum Realm and into the clutches of the mad despot Kang (Jonathan Majors).  Can Ant-Man and the Wasp (both current and classic) free the denizens of the Quantum Realm from Kang’s rule? Can they escape this subatomic realm without destroying the multiverse? How will they work ants into the plot this time?  We caught a sneak peek of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” and in keeping with the whole shrinking-and-growing motif, here’s what you need to know about the highs and the lows of the newest MCU movie. Redesign the poster, renegotiate the billing, call Kevin Feige and have him rework the whole slate: This movie is Pfeiffer’s from top to bottom. The improbability of an “Ant-Man” franchise is made even more surreal by the presence of screen legends Pfeiffer and Douglas. But where Janet van Dyne has been a small (heh) presence in previous films, she’s a giant in this film. “Quantumania” hinges on Janet’s three-decade exile outside of time and space, and it’s her arc and character relationships that drive the most satisfying parts of the plot. Fittingly, she feels like the co-lead here. No need to be entirely surprised — remember, Pfeiffer knows her way around a superhero movie (see “Batman Returns”). In “Quantumania,” Pfeiffer trades a bullwhip for space blasters and subatomic freedom fighting. She drips out exposition with steely, traumatized trepidation, and one of the film’s greatest joys is gradually discovering the legend that Janet’s built for herself in this strange world. One knife fight scene, in particular, will have you hoping for a Janet van Dyne trilogy next. The prominence of Pfeiffer’s character, unfortunately, bodes ill for the film’s ostensible second headliner, Lilly’s Wasp. She’s almost entirely lost in “Quantumania,” relegated to saving Ant-Man’s hide a few times while the script tells us how much they love each other, even though you’d be hard pressed to recall a single Hope van Dyne line. If we want to turn to the source text — hey, I grew up in a Bible household; I’m used to looking things up — this is not too shocking. Without getting too into the weeds, the MCU’s Hope van Dyne is a hodgepodge of various comic book characters. Mostly, she has the costume, haircut and superhero mantle of her mother in the original stories. The Janet van Dyne of the comics is one of Marvel’s most enduring heroes, even leading the Avengers for years. If the film version gives that heroic arc to Janet, there’s not much left for her daughter to do but flit around, zap people and be a narrative prop for Ant-Man. “Quantumania” feels like a “Star Wars”-esque space opera, even if the setting is far below us instead of way above. You’ll glean nods to sand planets and cantinas, armored fascists and creature-feature rebels. (Disney owns both Marvel and the “Star Wars” franchise; there’s a weirder alternate timeline where they just said “eff it” and did some shameless I.P. merging.) A little play with genre trappings is where the creativity ends in “Quantumania.” The film is puzzlingly average, hitting familiar beats faster than you can say “Pym particle.” Scott and Cassie don’t understand each other! Oh wait, they do now. This Kang fella sure seems like a particularly brutal threat we’ve never seen before! Oh wait, never mind, there he goes with the hand lasers. And while I’m not saying I could render a CGI world any better, the visual effects look a tad garish sometimes, which is probably not what you want when your movie is sharing theater space with an “Avatar” flick. Without spoiling, the rendering of one sorta-surprise villain, in particular, looks straight out of a Gushers commercial from the late ’90s. He’s supposed to look funny, but not that kind of funny. Speaking of funny, “Quantumania” isn’t so much. The “Ant-Man” movies have always been reliably more lighthearted and low-stakes than their MCU brethren. It’s been welcome levity, and if your leading man shrinks down to ride ants and is played by Paul Rudd, seems like a good strategy. It’s not that “Quantumania” is notably darker in tone than its predecessors, which could have been interesting. When it remembers the humor inherent in its premise, it just feels like they went the lazy route. It’s almost a parody of the much-derided MCU style of humor, at times, with characters cocking their heads to the side and a literal “Well, that happened” moment. Worth noting: “Quantumania” was scripted by Jeff Loveness, while the first two “Ant-Man” movies were written by teams that included Edgar Wright (on the first film) and Rudd himself. Try as you might, it’s impossible to separate a movie like “Quantumania” from its larger franchise. That’s a feature, not a bug. (Still has bugs, though. Lots of bugs.) As ever, fans flock to these movies for the next bit of interlocking, serialized plot, yours truly included. “Quantumania” has the goods. It lets Majors take new big bad Kang out for a joyride without feeling like he’s just slumming it in an “Ant-Man” picture. It sets up yet another “Young Avengers” character (see America Chavez in the last “Doctor Strange,” Kate Bishop in “Hawkeye,” etc.) in Cassie. And it certainly, certainly does not waste its two post-credit scenes. "
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE," Not everyone is a fan of the Ant-Man series which is a shame, because Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), ex-con turned Avenger, Survivor of The Blip and eternal optimist is such a nice guy. He’s more than okay with people knowing he’s an Avenger, even if they can’t remember which one. He’s reconnecting with his daughter Cassie (Katheryn Newton) who’s evolving into quite the chip off the old block, despite his best efforts. His girlfriend Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) is head of an industry powerhouse, the Pym Van Dyne Foundation, dedicated to helping people adjust after the Blip and provide sustainable sources of food and energy using the Pym Particle. He’s helping Hope’s mother Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) readjust to earth after 30 years in the Quantum Realm (it’s a whole thing) – and her father Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to having his wife back. Scott’s book, Look Out for the Little Guy (Hyperion Ave, 2023) is doing surprisingly well. Everything is going great for Scott and he’s thrilled to live in the moment. While showing off her quantum research to her family, Cassie receives an unexpected message from someone inside the Quantum Realm, and the family is then literally sucked into the Quantum Realm. Lost and separated from each other, Scott and Cassie encounter Quantum People, entities from all over the known and unknown universes on a rebel mission to bring down their oppressor. Meanwhile, Hank and Hope lean on Janet, who knows the Quantum Realm better than anyone, to help reunite everyone to get them home safely. Not everyone is happy to have Janet back, and those that are won’t be so willing to see her leave. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is heavily layered in story, characters, and, unavoidably, CGI. This isn’t just a double quest within a quest story, or any particular villain’s back story. We learn what Janet was up to for the 30 years she was gone, and it wasn’t herding alien cattle. She was the original Wasp, after all, and she did not let those espionage or fighting skills get rusty. What she did to survive and how she escapes made a story of legend and infamy, making her current journey home more difficult. Michelle Pfeiffer gives Janet a haunted and hunted determination that already makes up for the comically mawkish Thor: Love and Thunder (2022). While this is primarily a Janet story, Scott and Cassie aren’t completely forgotten as they align themselves with the hopeless and forgotten, you know, the Little Guy. Cassie comes into her own as a formidable helper, driven by the need to fight anyone’s oppressor, regardless of how big or powerful. Scott continues to grow into more than the guy that can get really big as a genuinely good-hearted man who just wants to get home, but isn’t above getting kidnapped to make it happen. The Quantum Realm itself is a gorgeous alien place and a lot of effort has gone to make sure it’s nothing like a familiar Earth, that helps in terms of creatures encountered and driving motivations. And there’s the Big Bad of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, and since he’s on the posters, it can be assumed that we know it’s Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), first encountered in Season 1 of Loki (Marvel Studios, 2022). This Kang is one of many, many variants, but this one, exiled to the Quantum Realm, insists he must get to save the universe from his variant selves. Since we already know that Kangs have a taste for destruction in the service of the Time Line, you can expect deadly armies, untrustworthy allies, and a deep crushing sadness that infuses everything he touches. I like Jonathan Majors as an inscrutable anti-villain, one who knows what’s coming and still tries to stop it, using less than noble methods. I don’t know if Marvel has it in them to create a standalone Kang movie, and I don’t know if I’d want to watch it, but I’d read a well-crafted novella read by Jonathan Majors. As we move into the MCU Phase V, I think it’s safe to begin expecting a new kind of Marvel movie, one that focuses on rebuilding families (both blood and acquaintance) and the fearful anticipation of what’s to come. The MCU spent Phase IV showing a sprawling universe of known and unknown characters and at some point, they’re all going to have to come together to beat the crap out of each other. We’ve got a whole multiverse to sit down to, so let Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania be that appetizer. There is one mid-credit and one post-credit scene, so if you need to relieve yourself of your large Cherry/Coke frozen drink, you’ll have time between the two. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) is rated PG-13 for mild swears, dismemberment, giant bugs, a giant head, exploding bodies, a disintegration ray, people getting beat up, and drinking the fluids of another creature without consent."
"Mar 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," Marvel’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania feels like deja vu. Starring Paul Rudd, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton and Jonathan Majors, the latest Marvel installment is… fine. Listen, I love a Marvel film and I’m just nerdy enough to understand the implications the film is supposed to have as it ushers in Phase 5. What I’m at a loss to understand is just why this task was laid at the feet of Ant-Man.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the third installment of Ant-Man movies. Ant-Man made his first Avenger appearance in Captain America: Civil War making Ant-Man a fun fanboy cum fixture to the team. Paul Rudd plays a perfect Scott Lang and brings a dorky comedic energy while still flexing his superhero powers.  It’s that comedic wit and relatability that made Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp watchable stops during Phase 3 and 4. The wonder of Scott Lang was a grown up version of Peter Parker – he was someone who was still awed by the idea of being a hero and helping people. The innocence of that appears to be lost in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.  We’re post “The Snap” and the events of Avengers: End Game and Scott and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) have returned from the Quantum realm with Hope’s father and Scott’s mentor, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hope’s mother, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). Janet was trapped in the Quantum Realm – or the universe just under our own – for more than 30 years. Since she’s been back she’s acclimated back to life quickly while the rest of her family moves on. Scott becomes an author of a self help memoir and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) research’s Pym technologies and is eager to learn more about the Quantum Realm. It’s her research that changes the trajectory of film. Hope has secretly been sending signals to the Quantum Realm in the hopes of getting more answers about the mysterious place. Though Janet was there, she’s reluctant to speak. She tells them that the Quantum Realm is a desolate and empty place full of danger. If that’s true, then who is returning their call? They all go to inspect the noise and are sucked back into the realm. Thankfully Hope and Scott have their suits at the ready and when they get separated, Scott learns that Cassie has made one too. It’s while they’re trying to find their way back to each other that they discover the world is full of beings and one in particular that isn’t happy to see them.  Along the way we run into several fun cameos and pick up some allies. Standouts include William Jackson Harper as Quaz and Katy O’Brian as Jentorra. We’re also introduced to Kang (Jonathan Majors who was in a completely different movie and the movie was made better for it). Kang seems to be a facsimile of “He Who Remains” from the Loki Disney+ series. This recurring villain will be the bane of our Phase 5 heroes and his introduction is… tepid?  Interestingly enough, the intro in Loki felt much more effective. In a film that is both too long, and too short, we spend plenty of time with Kang without really learning anything about him. This is important because it exposes one of my main fears about the coming Phase and the trap I believe Marvel will fall into. If you’re not as familiar with Marvel lore, and don’t watch the Disney+ series or the Marvel series on Netflix (Luke Cage, Punisher, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron First, etc), then you’re kind of out of luck. This was evidenced during the Hawkeye series where a Daredevil villain showed up and left me asking… whomst?  While I was excited to see Kang, it was because I’d enjoyed the Loki series and understood they were connected. If you’re just going in blind to Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumnia, you might be confused, or even worse, indifferent. This is bad enough, but when it removes any real tension from the film, what you’re left with is Marvel’s take on a Star Wars movie. There’s even a cantina scene. Between Star Wars, Avatar, and Thor: Love & Thunder, there are obnoxious influences in the design and effects. Also, because the Quantum Realm is essentially a state of mind, it’s completely CGI. There are some scenes that display this beautifully and others that could… use a little work.  I wouldn’t say the film is bad. Once we start going further into Phase 5, I’m sure there will be easter eggs that might make it genius, it just still remains a confusing choice to introduce the first post-Thanos villain (Wanda doesn’t count!) and the heroes that will try and defeat them. Also, the two post credit scenes do make it worth it in the end. I’ve said this about some of the other Marvel properties, but I kind of wish that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was a series. Where they could take time and really introduce us to the fabled Quantum Realm.  It’s because of the relationship between Antman and the Quantum Realm, and the Quantum Realm and multiverse time travel – which is the basis of the multiverse saga."
"Mar 15, 2023",NEUTRAL," That’s shocking, considering Ant-Man (played by Paul Rudd) is the franchise’s comic. In his earlier outings, he had a hefty dose of “Guardians of the Galaxy” humor and didn’t seem to be the kind of guy who’d get tied up in angst. Now, however, his daughter has been taken hostage and he has to figure out how to get her back. Besides the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), he has her parents (Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) to sort things out. Pfeiffer’s Janet has more than a little background on the Quantum Realm and insists they do something to shut it down. The place – not unlike a lava lamp – is a lot of blurry color, filled with goofy characters and, supposedly, Kang (Jonathan Majors), a bad guy who’s so bad no one cares to elaborate. He wants Ant-Man to get him a power core or daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) is toast. In the course of making that exchange happen, we get M.O.D.O.K. (who looks like he was created by a pre-schooler), some characters with broccoli heads and Bill Murray (spoiler alert) as a terrorist of sorts. It’s all so haphazard you wonder if maybe the characters should just perish in the Quantum Realm and let the rest of the Avengers press on. Director Peyton Reed uses a new method to film scenes (essentially, it’s a different green screen) but they look extremely flat. When Pfeiffer makes her way through the realm, it’s like watching someone at a theme park ride that’s constantly breaking down. Douglas doesn’t contribute much, either, and Lilly is absent so much of the film it’s a wonder she got her character’s name in the title. Newton and Rudd are most prominent; Majors is great as Kang but the character doesn’t get enough screen time to help us understand why he’s such a threat (and why he’ll play a part in coming Avengers films). He has the gravitas to play a villain. It’s just weird that he’s put into play with Ant-Man, one of Marvel’s lesser superheroes. Because audiences warm to Rudd’s humor, his third stand-alone Ant-Man outing should have gone for the laughs, not some convoluted mythology that explains nothing. When he does get back to his jokey ways, it’s too late, particularly since Kang has introduced fear into a world that was just getting over the blip."
"Mar 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," Another year, another entry into the MCU with ANT-MAN AND THE WASP : QUANTUMANIA! How important is this movie in the grand scheme, why was this one so divisive and is Marvel Fatigue starting to set in? Let's discuss on Mad About Movies."
"Mar 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,While Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania&#8217;s overwhelming onslaught of half baked CGI and hamfisted performances may be the bulk of the film&#8217;s over two hour runtime&#44; one performer who isn&#8217;t sleepwalking to his payday is Jonathan Majors&#46;
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE," A disastrous mess with the Ant population expanding. Even the family gardener has a suit which means Scott Lang’s role is reduced to carrying everybody’s luggage. ANT-MAN (2015) and ANT-MAN AND THE WASP (2018) were directed by Peyton Reed. Now comes Reed’s ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA. I am not a comic book devotee, even though I  sat through the previous two ANT-MAN movies. I see too many movies to remember who is who in the Ant-Wasp family dynamics. Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang, the Ant-Man. He became an Avenger. His Avenger skill is that he can minimize himself as an ant and fly. He also has ant MMA skills.  QUANTUMANIA begins in the Quantum Realm where Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), the original WASP, has spent 30 years. She was rescued in the last film. It turns out that she was doing more than taming the landscape. Janet saved the life of a pilot, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Mayers), whose ship had crashed in the Quantum Realm. Janet befriends Kang choosing to believe he crashed instead of being banished to the Quantum Realm due to his despot leanings. We return to the present day Universe where a family dinner includes Lang’s bug/girlfriend The Wasp,  Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Lang’s 18-year-old daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) and Hope’s parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and the newly rescued Janet. Pym’s faithfulness understandably  took a slip because 30 years is a long time to wait for Janet’s return. Why doesn’t Hope use her father’s last name? Is there an ex-husband lurching somewhere with a suit of his own? I’m completely confused and could not find any answers on Google. Did Michael Douglas insist Hank have had a dalliance while waiting around for Janet to return to The Earth Realm? Douglas couldn’t abide having Pym celibate for 30 years. I’m suspicious about the 30 year hiatus. Was Janet and Kang just friends?  If Hope’s parents are Hank and Janet, why are they raising Cassie as her faux-grandparents? Where is Cassie’s mother? Did Cassie’s mother lose custody? Cassie has been messing around in the Pym basement under the tutelage of her indulgent faux-grandparents. She has created a gizmo, and while showing it off, something goes wrong and everyone transits back to the Quantum Realm. They are separated into two groups. Janet takes over as she spent 30 years in this place. Unfortunately, every superhero, cartoon, animation and sci-fi trope are thrown into the Quantum Realm. There are cameos by GHOSTBUSTER’S Dough Boy, King Kong, Broccoli Man, Jello Kid and Baby Yoda. I even saw Stan Lee dressed as a freedom fighter. Pandora’s people are hiding in the wavy plants. I understand that the ANT franchise needs a nepo-superhero. Why Cassie? What gives Cassie the right to a suit and all the powers that come with it? With a nepo-superhero, the franchise can continue. Giving Janet a major part in QUANTUMANIA, set up Scott Lang a standby role. It used to be who you knew. Now it’s who your parents are. It certainly is a fact that nepotism in Hollywood is flourishing – Kevin Bacon stars in a commercial with his daughter and Judd Apatow’s daughter Maude is in EUPHORIA, so now It's Iris Apatow’s turn. Why hasn’t their been an article about the nepo-babies who failed, like the Willis girls? No matter how much effort was put into making Rumor Willis a star, it never happened. And neither of her sisters made any bank on their Hollywood privilege. Or Clint Eastwood’s daughters. Get ready for Apple Paltrow Martin to be unleashed on Hollywood. If your child does not want to memorize lines and audition, there is always modeling – even if you are five feet tall. If your mother is Madonna, you can cat walk during Paris Fashion Week and be in Vogue magazine. There is also the Iris Apatow’s stepping stone route – being named an ambassador for a sneaker company. Whatever that entails. When the foursome finally reunite, Janet takes the lead and, knowing the environs so well, takes them to meet the Realm’s QB, Bill Murray. He stops the movie cold. No matter what they paid him, they should have left his scene on the editor’s floor. I know he’s beloved, but his career has been tainted by all the cruelty and suffering he doled out to co-stars as well as the sexual harassment claims. Well-known for not having any representation or a home address (only Sofia Coppola seems to have him on speed dial), Reed should not have hunted him down so aggressively. With Cassie now an Ant-wearing superhero and a Quantum Realm tribal slave race uprising, Scott Lang renounces the lead to Janet. Hope surrenders her WASP position by wearing a terrible mid-western state functional short hairdo wig that changes colors.  And what is up with Corey Stoll’s Darren returning as M.O.D.O.K., a Humpty-Dumpty figure with a big head in a tiny insect body? I wouldn’t have minded more of him as he tried to get a date for the slave uprising Festival. QUANTUMANIA writer Jeff Loveness does give Scott Lang the current multiple selves CGI that we all saw in Adam Driver’s commercial on Super Bowl Sunday."
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE," Between Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors, you have a great cast that gets lost in an overstuffed story. It struggles tonally to balance the humor and darker action scenes. It feels more like a setup for the next movie or the next Loki episode versus actually exploring the family and story that we have here. There's no emotional connections, so many of the characters just didn't get enough screen time, and the goals of what they're setting up with Kang feel too abstract. It seems that there are too many Marvel projects dropping right now to the point that it’s become overwhelming to keep up with and the quality is starting to suffer. In the new sports comedy Champions, Woody Harrelson plays a jaded basketball coach who feels like he should be further along in his career than he really is. Because of that, he has a short temper that ends up getting him in trouble. He gets community service working with the Friends, which is a special needs basketball group who are competing to go to the Special Olympics.  I enjoyed that the film didn’t fall into stereotypes when it came to working with actors with disabilities. They’re the ones teaching Harrelson life lessons about getting close to people and forming real personal connections. There’s a bit of crude humor, but it’s a really heartfelt and feel-good movie that many people will enjoy. Netflix’s hottest singles from Too Hot To Handle, Love Is Blind, The Circle, The Ultimatum, The Mole, Selling Tampa, and more return for a new dating competition in Perfect Match. Hosted by Nick Lachey, the former cast members are brought together to find love in a tropical paradise.  Netflix has found a surefire hit that brings together their biggest players from other shows. It is absolutely addicting and the definition of mindless reality television that you can’t help but keep watching. If they move forward with a second season, I’d love to see them address gameplay issues to encourage contestants to truly get to know potential matches and increase inclusivity. Based on this first season, contestants seem more focused on clout than truly finding love, which may or may not work for some viewers. In Netflix’s We Have A Ghost, a family finds out their new home is haunted by a ghost named Ernest. Footage of him turns them all into overnight social media sensations, but they become the target of the CIA when they try to uncover Ernest’s mysterious past.  Unfortunately they don’t know what to do with this interesting concept and star-studded cast of David Harbour, Anthony Mackie, and Jennifer Coolidge.

"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,I cannot imagine ranking it anywhere other than dead last out of the 31 features presently constituting the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#46;
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Clumsy storytelling and underdeveloped characters unfortunately prevented it from being the spectacular strong start that Phase 5 needed it to be.
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE," If you haven't been paying attention, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has just closed out the so-called Phase 4 of its continuing series of movies, TV shows, games and commercial tie-ins. After the rousing success of the previous phases -- and the brilliant culmination of everything that had come before it by the end of Phase 3 -- the studio had an enviable headwind heading into their next wave of releases. But after seven pretty middling films (other than ""Wakanda Forever,"" which did the best it could sans its leading man), it's pretty clear the good ship MCU has entered serious horse latitudes. With the exception of ""Wakanda,"" parts of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home,"" and the first half or so of ""Shang Chi,"" the rest of the studio's output over the past couple of years -- films including ""Black Widow,"" ""Eternals,"" ""Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness,"" and ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" -- have all succumbed to various levels of cinematic degradation. Symptoms include threadbare characters, middling plots, incoherent interconnectivity and, mostly, massive CGI-overkill that suggests the screenplays were barely cobbled together before filming began (the surest sign of a weak script: an action climax that is all giant, ephemeral monsters, endless ray blasts and zero emotional attachment). The hope for rabid fans was that after a tortuous period of time where filmmakers and production teams were spread too thin among the endlessly churning properties, Phase 5 would finally start to gather the various plot-threads from previous films/shows and put together another solid run. If this film, the first of Phase 5, is any indication, however, things are going from bad to worse. ""Ant Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a lifeless, mirthless CGI saturnalia that dispenses almost entirely with the emotional core of its characters. In its place, Peyton Reed and his production team have resorted to the worst sort of empty spectacle filmmaking. When we begin, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has everything going his way. As a celebrity Avenger, having helped thwart Thanos' blip, he's beloved everywhere he goes. He has a bestselling memoir (""Look Out for the Little Guy""), he's friends with his former FBI adversary (Randall Park), and his integrated family life -- his now-grown daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), living with him and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet Pym (Michelle Pfieffer), and his girlfriend, Hope Pym (Evangeline Lilly) -- seems perfect. Naturally, things go south from there. After Cassie and Hank reveal a project they've been working on, a sort of transmitter that is able to scan the quantum realm, the entire crew gets sucked into the subatomic universe by Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a despot with whom Janet had been acquainted during her time trapped there, in order to restore the precious multiversal engine core drive from his previously damaged spacecraft, allowing him to continue wreaking time-confounding havoc throughout the collected universes. Split by their tumbling entry into two factions, Scott and Cassie meet with a group of anti-Kang rebels, led by the fierce Jentorra (Katy O'Brian, and the telepath Quaz (William Jackson Harper), before they get captured by the Conqueror himself, along with his henchman, M.O.D.O.K. (Corey Stoll), a sort of giant, floating head encased in armor. Meanwhile, Janet, Hank and Hope emerge in a giant city, run by Kang, and attempt to evade him, while making plans to destroy his core drive permanently. As these things tend to do, it all culminates in a giant battle, with Kang perched upon leaving this micro-realm and returning to his former glory, and the Ant-heroes, along with their new rebel friends, throwing an all-out assault against him. What helped previous MCU films was the idea that each character charted its own pace and tone within the larger universe of other characters: Captain America movies tended toward a kind of espionage thriller vibe; Iron Man flicks were high-tech, eye candy set-tos; Spider-Man films were high school dramas with super-powered bullies; Thor movies started as slow, Shakespearean tragedies, but morphed into clever send-ups of such pompous overreach. Even with characters without such a notable fan-following, say, the Guardians of the Galaxy, MCU lead producer Kevin Fiege would hire production teams to craft a tangible vibe. Ant-Man movies, especially compared to some of their more out-there brethren, dealing with intergalactic space wars, and giant gods gone mad, were happily more grounded on Earth, and dealt with easily recognizable types of conflicts (in the second film of the series, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" Scott was under house arrest for assisting Captain America in Germany while on parole, and had to avoid FBI surveillance in order to keep seeing Cassie regularly). For these kinds of low-key supes flicks, Paul Rudd, a charismatic, affable everyman, was perfect in the role, and the films' shaggy self-referentiality added a welcome layer of humor to the silliness. Here, however, Reed and screenwriter Jeff Loveness (whose previous credits include jokes for the Oscars, and a handful of ""Rick & Morty"" episodes) push the characters into CGI ­hellscapes of such soul-dampening excess that their grounding is almost thoroughly lost. Instead of relatable, engaging characters, such as Scott's best friend, Luis (Michael Pena), from the previous films, we get a small blob named Veb (voiced by David Dastmalchian, who played Kurt in the earlier films), and a dude with an energy launcher where his head should be. Scott himself does little more than run around asking questions, and looking lovingly at his daughter. Hope, stuck as she is with her parents, feels about as essential to the film's grinding machinery as a warm can of Fanta. For all the plays at making this abject cartoonishness engaging (""You're inside Schrodinger's box,"" M.O.D.O.K. tells Scott at one point, ""and you're the cat!""), it feels as unfocused and meandering as any regrettable Phase 4 offering. Yes, by the end, Kang is better established as the forthcoming new heavy that will no doubt lead the Avengers to do battle, but despite Majors' herculean efforts to make the character interesting, he comes across as any other bland tyrant Thanos-wannabe (""I will burn the broken world,"" he intones during one of his many villain digressions), only now with more time-travel options available to him. It's possible the MCU will right itself, despite the furious pace of content creation by the powers that be at Disney (never a company to shy away from bilking every last dime out of its intellectual property) -- or, maybe, the newly hatched DC Universe, under the helm of James Gunn, will take the mantle as the comic book universe of note -- but, more than likely, it will keep floundering, and continue to lose any and all the goodwill it banked in the heady 2010's. ""You think this is new to me?"" Scott asks Kang incredulously near the end. He means it as a blow against Kang's enormous pride, but it could just as well serve as a sort of epitaph for the MCU as we knew it.

"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL," cott Lang gets sucked into the Quantum Realm but ends up stuck in a cheesy Star Wars knock-off instead in Quantumania, the third film in the Ant-Man arc of the increasingly lacklustre Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie finds the mega-franchise continuing to struggle as it fails, yet again, to find its post-Endgame footing, stumbling this time in an attempt to establish the series’ next Big Bad. The latest adventure takes Lang (Paul Rudd), his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), his girlfriend Hope (Evangeline Lily), and Hope’s parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) into the subatomic universe where Janet was previously trapped for three decades, but fails to do anything interesting with the concept. After Cassie creates a device that can make contact with the Quantum Realm (in the latest episode of “teenagers building impossibly intricate technology in a basement”), the aforementioned quintet gets sucked into a portal that pulls them in. When they land in a sprawling city populated with all kinds of beings, it becomes obvious that Janet has been keeping quite a few secrets from her family. Turns out her time in the Realm was more eventful than anyone would have expected and found her running into Kang (Jonathan Majors), an exiled traveller who poses a threat to the multiverse. Kang wants to escape. The Ant-gang wants to stop him, once they figure out what’s actually going on. (There’s an exasperating amount of “character refusing to divulge info that would instantly make things easier for everyone” in the first half of the film.) It’s all a bit underwhelming. You’ve got a villain who seems to forget, from moment to moment, what powers he has and who isn’t established as the kind of menacing threat that the future of the MCU needs. Then there are characters with not much to do for almost the entirety of the movie, tonal shifts that don’t work, writing that just isn’t very good, the film’s general reluctance to do something bold or substantial... The whole thing seems to be built almost entirely on cliches and tropes, with no gravity, no sense of impact or consequence. This isn’t the most promising start to MCU’s Phase Five, and one can only hope the franchise corrects course in the coming instalments."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE," Welcome back to the wonderful world of Scott Lang, where things just always work out in the end. When we left off with Scott in Endgame in 2019. Wait, we haven’t seen this dude for a whole presidency?!? Well, nothing has really changed. He’s still coasting off being the MVP of ‘the blip’ and finally getting the recognition he’s always wanted. He wrote a book. Now, Quantumania is clearly supposed to change his status as a hero, but how do we do that after Thanos? Where can he possibly go from here? What’s the next level up? Oh yeah, he’s Ant-Man so the next level is down. We’re going back to the Quantum Realm. Quantumania tries really hard to make us care about Scott Lang and the stakes of his hero’s journey, and it falls kind of flat. There’s a huge focus on Scott’s home life and his relationship with his daughter in particular. Cassie is running around these streets doing vigilante things having never been to one superhero class. The whole movie really revolves around two plots. Cassie and her development into who we know to be the hero, Stinger. Also, the mystery of what led Janet Van Dyne to want to escape the Quantum Realm and never return. Both points are never really resolved, have Galactus-sized plotholes in them, and make this movie look a lot like a setup for later Phase 5 projects. Quantumania attempts to make Ant-Man into a high-stakes hero and the movie uses Scott’s love for his daughter to do it. This Scott Lang is more edgy and capable of going to a dark place to get the job done, but can the MCU’s resident funny man take us there and make us care? Not really. We get way more from Michelle Phiffer’s Janet than ever before and it feels refreshing but seems out of place. The more we learn about Janet’s thirty years in the Quantum Realm, the more it feels like we needed more than one movie to flesh that arc out. We are given a whole new dimension to branch off into for more Ant-Man adventures. If you didn’t know before this movie, Jonathan Majors is HIM right now. The brother is in three high-profile films this year alone. That said, his reprisal of Kang is the exact level of intensity and charisma Majors is known for. However, after he gave us the slick, suave, knowledgeable He Who Remains at the end of Loki season one I was not ready for him to flip the switch and wild out in Quantumania. Majors already let folks know what he was called to do as the multiversal mega villain, to play. Play. All. The. Kangs. Meaning each one is different, and he’s going to bring everything he’s got in the tank to make it happen. This take on Kang hits. He’s focused and ruthless and plays his cards close to his chest until the very last second. More nuanced is the core of desperation that fuels this man, Majors is in touch with the very core of this character. He eats every scene he’s in. And really shines playing off of the naivete and innocence of Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man. Something about the manic way Kang bares his teeth at others brings out their own desperation and it shows. Majors really applied pressure on everyone he shared the screen with. In all honesty, he’s the sole reason to check this movie out. The way he holds the character begs the question: can he keep the MCU as shook as Thanos did? Can he keep the Avengers in a chokehold for like five to ten years? Can Kang’s name ring bells across the multiverse? We gon’ see. Real rap, Quantumania is not terrible, but it is a miss for me. The pacing is strange for an MCU movie, the way we move into the Quantum Realm is so quick it feels cheap. It was like, “You already know where we’re going from the trailer! Let’s go!” Quantumania was really giving Osmosis Jones energy and it felt wrong for the format. The hollow pieces of plot (that could have been rich with lore from the source material) made it feel more episodic than it should have. This could have easily been a Disney+ ‘Special Presentation’ in the way that Werewolf By Night was and setup the rest of Phase 5. In spite of its shortcomings, the acting was great. Michelle Pfeiffer’s still got it and does a great job gifting us more substance than we’ve ever gotten from any version of Janet Van Dyne. Majors does his thing and transcends the medium; it feels like he brings one hundred and ten percent to every moment. Everyone else kind of fades into the background. Kathern Newton holds her own but is a weird choice as Cassie Lang. Simply because MCU audiences have been asked to engage Scott’s identity through his plucky and clever daughter and now she’s…someone else…with none of the chemistry of the last two Cassies. Standout performances came from the denizens of the Quantum Realm, Katy O’Brian stole a few scenes as the stone-spirited Jentorra whose abs alone could have saved the multiverse. David Dastmalchian doesn’t reprise his role as Eastern Bloc hacker Kurt but shows his versatile whimsy as the gelatinous Veb.  The one that hurts my heart is the use of fellow unexpectedly chiseled and very talented Black actor William Jackson Harper (who many have petitioned for to be the next Reed Richards) as a throwaway plot device character. He channels some of the Chidi swag from The Good Place and performs really well with a wasted character. Standing out in a different light is the very unnecessary cameo from Bill Murray as a resistance contact from Janet’s heyday. It was just weird and distracted entirely from what was happening. Mind you, Quantumania is pretty to look at – the visual effects are running on a high clip. The Ant-Man suit is looking a little evolved and it’s bordering on too much detail, but it has the functional look down pat. The Wasp and Stinger suits look great and the details like the push-button deployment look dope too. Kang looks as great as The Conqueror, I know that metallic purple and bright green are not easy to pull off, so, props to the design team. Visually there was very little to pick at and the sound choices are still as dynamic and unique as the ones for Star Wars. You know exactly when Pym particles are being used and when Kang is out here letting his Time Blicky off and erasing bystanders from the timeline. This movie does not feel like an Ant-Man movie. Peyton Reed misses out on the key details that made Ant-Man stand out from the rest of the MCU. The comedy used to be circumstantial and based on these well-acted relationships. To watch a whole Ant-Man movie without any of Michael Peña’s Luis is criminal. Not just a fan favorite, but there are folks who would watch an entire movie of just Luis talking his shit and punching people in the face. So yeah, that’s a monstrous fail. Add to that not having Judy Greer and Bobby Cannavale to ground audiences in Cassie’s development – and it becomes so much harder to care about anything that happens to her at all. I firmly believe there are places for politics in any piece of media, but they went too hard in the paint on this one. Peyton Reed had Cassie looking like Kendell Jenner in that Pepsi ad solving the world’s ills by doing little performative actions. The caucasity was at peak levels in ways that distracted from the ‘look out for the little guy’ thematic thread that made the franchise unique. Reed’s execution makes it look like protestors are ‘the little guy’. It reads as out of touch. Add all these things up and it feels like Quantumania gets pumped out because the MCU machine demands it. As if the studio is too big to fail, making it subject to putting out the kind of lackluster movies the nerdosphere clowned the DCEU for. How in THE hell is Darren Cross now MODOK? Why? Tell me the reason! He was great as the villain of the week in Ant-Man, but to do that Marvel Studios already had to undermine Hank Pym’s run as Yellowjacket. Which came after Marvel Studios took the creation of Ultron from Pym too?! We will not have it, oh! To make MODOK a Kang lackey removes his AIM origin and limits his life and second death to the Ant-Man franchise. MODOK has so much to offer as an off-kilter character that seeing them mishandled like that annoyed me to no end. Marvel Studios, y’all need to stop killing your villains. The stakes need to be at their highest to necessitate that. If it ain’t Endgame-level drama happening, just don’t do it. Deadass. Kang’s empire in Quantumania was the spitting image of his Chronopolis in the dimension of Limbo. Both are important to the character of Kang and the fabric of the multiverse. Making his base of operations in the Quantum Realm feels like a cheap ploy to keep the dimension relevant. Especially since Ant-Man and the Wasp had it looking like a trippy no-man’s-land where Janet was left to her own devices and couldn’t wait to send Scott there to collect them special particles. So why make it a place so dangerous now where Janet was a *checks notes * “freedom fighter” against Kang’s authoritarian rule? So much of this realm (which doesn’t exist in the comics) is so convenient for the sake of this one movie, and it doesn’t hit. I dub the Quantum Realm as Liquid Asgard from here on out. Whose choice was it to reveal one of Kang’s essential “alias” identities? Whose? In the mid-credits scene, we are treated to a meeting of a gathering of Kangs, and it’s cool on one hand to see the full scope of Kang’s impact on the multiverse. We revisit a newer trope in the digital movie age, one actor playing dozens of themselves with different reactions and expressions. Majors goes all out for it, and it lands. However, we also meet the high council of Kangs. A trio representing his most influential and powerful versions from the far past, present, and far future; we see it led by none other than Immortus, ruler of Limbo (what they are calling the Quantum Realm in the MCU). It’s our first time seeing Immortus in live action although he is referred to by He Who Remains in the Loki season one finale. It’s cool to see, but it felt like a weird place to reveal such a large and potentially brilliant secret.  When I first saw Immortus, I thought it was Conan (the barbarian, not the comedian) and Dr. Strange’s rogues all-star Kulan Gath! Now, the character of Kang has been around since 1963 and Kulan Gath since 1974, and they weren’t revealed to have any interaction until Savage Avengers in 2021. If that was Kang all dolled up in a Kulan Gath get-up, in the post-movie credits no less, could you imagine the implications? Do you know how dope it would be to get an Ant-Man and Dr. Strange team up ala No Way Home? Well, it wasn’t him, but who knows? One day, far in the future, we might get that as an escape loophole for Kang. But, probably not. The Victor Timely cameo was cool and a great deep cut for comic historians. Its’ connection to Disney+’s Loki season two was the most refreshing part of the movie and that is saying the quiet part out loud. Why play with such vaulted and important Marvel lore without any payoff? Comics fans will suffer quite a bit through Quantumania while MCU fans get their worlds expanded. If you’re looking for a fun, family-friendly, big-budget marquee superhero movie, this is your flick. Quantumania is purely set up for Phase 5 of the MCU, dressing the stage for Kang to be the big bad. Nothing about the movie moves Scott’s story forward, but everyone else’s does. As a standalone movie, it falls squarely right in the center of worth it and not worth it to see in theaters. The reality is, if you want to keep up with the universe, you’re gonna see it anyway. Until we see how this phase pans out, Quantumania is ranking pretty low as far as Marvel movies go. Let’s see what happens next."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL," The Son★☆☆☆☆The trick to Florian Zeller’s 2020 Oscar winner The Father is that it was told from the point of view of an elderly man (Anthony Hopkins) in the advanced stages of dementia, from which vantage point he seemed eminently sane. The result was like a cross between King Lear and a Rubik’s Cube — the ploy allowed us to ride the rollercoaster of Hopkins’s emotions and feel a virtuoso performance from the inside, rather than merely admiring it from the outside."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL," *** No one ever says that Sandra (Léa Seydoux) is spread too thin in One Fine Morning, writer-director Mia Hansen-Løve’s follow-up to Bergman Island, but it’s obvious when you observe the Parisian single mother’s daily routine. Through weariness and without complaint, Sandra dotes on her young daughter and cares for her dementia-ridden father, struggling to imagine how a new romance could fit into her life. But it’s not just the contents of Sandra’s plate that suggest a put-upon person; it’s how Hansen-Løve allows all the other characters to monologue. Sandra’s love interest (Melvil Poupaud) is a verbose chemist, her mother (Nicole Garcia) a remarried political advocate, her daughter (Camille Leban Martins) a bright young student. Even Sandra’s career as a translator deemphasizes her perspective. That’s a fascinating challenge for Seydoux, a movie star (best known for Bond films and Blue Is the Warmest Color) inhabiting an everyday person decentralized in her own life. It’s a frustratingly subversive, perhaps overly thorough approach to making the audience constantly hope that someone else will put Sandra first. Maybe that day will come some fine morning. Maybe the reprieve will last five minutes. Maybe this is just the thankless labor for too many women. R. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Cinema 21. *** Boxing legend Marvin Hagler once quipped that it’s hard to get up at 5 am “when you’ve been sleeping in silk pajamas.” That’s the comfort predicament for Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan). He’s now a gladiator in quiet detente, surrounded by fineries: a beautiful family (Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashad, Mila Davis-Kent), a robust knitwear collection, and a promising post-boxing career as a gym owner. But his bliss is interrupted by Dame Anderson (Jonathan Majors, cementing himself as 2023′s Biggest Bad after playing Marvel’s Kang), a childhood friend and veritable shadow of Adonis, locked up as a teenager and now hulking toward a title shot. With a posture and wardrobe modeled on Mike Tyson’s Spartan intimidation, Majors enriches the character with bone-deep anxiety and loneliness. Like all the Creed films, III reimagines its Rocky forebears in better taste: empathy for “villains,” better roles for women, honest conversations between Black heroes and antiheroes. Does it toss the electricity and breakneck pacing of Rocky III out with Mr. T’s bathwater? Regrettably. Do the scenes of men learning how to cry outshine the combat that Jordan himself now directs? Also yes. But pity the franchise that, unlike this one, refuses to work on itself. PG-13. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER.

How could Emily dare write a novel so rife with “selfish” characters as Wuthering Heights, her older sister Charlotte implores. Actor-turned-director Frances O’Connor’s debut film then flashes back to Emily’s teen years to consider the pain, passion and self-focus necessary for a young woman to pen an all-time-great novel in a culture deadening to her inspiration. Emma Mackey (star of Netflix’s Sex Education) plays Emily as a proverbial middle child, rebellious with a sly remove. She employs her senses as a sponge, soaking in the ghostly vigor of the West Yorkshire moors despite the Anglican influence of her father (Adrian Dunbar) and hunky new local preacher William Weightman (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). O’Connor’s script largely invents a web of Brontë family dynamics, positing her path to becoming the lit-loving clan’s simultaneous North Star and black sheep. That’s a welcome alternative to depicting staunch Victorian manners and Emily glued to a writing desk. Still, one wonders if a slightly bloodier performance (think Keira Knightly, circa 2007), as opposed to Mackey’s inherently modern-feeling cool, could have elevated the sensuousness. But as an act of risk-taking imagination, Emily gives a legendary novelist and the power of selfishness their rightful flowers. R. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Fox Tower, Living Room. ** After cringing through a full trilogy of nobody’s favorite superhero, it may be impossible to differentiate the gibbering insufferableness of Paul Rudd from the cornball inanity of his character, Scott “Ant-Man” Lang. Admittedly, the Ant-Man oeuvre was never expected to spark casual fan interest in such an eminently second-tier figure, but at least the first movie maintained just enough anarchic frisson from original director Edgar Wright’s abandoned treatment to breeze through the drearier aspects of Marvel Cinematic Universe world building. The third installment, conversely, serves as a de facto origin story for Marvel’s next archvillain. Turns out far-future warlord Kang (Jonathan Majors) was once loosed upon Ant-Man trilogy matriarch Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) during her lost years in the universe known as the Quantum Realm, a revelation that brings our heroes back Quantumville way. In its best scenes, the film lets Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas (returning as Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man) clash with the always-captivating Majors, trade quips with an aging lothario (Bill Murray), or just pose iconic amid gorgeous imagery ripped from vintage sci-fi digest covers. Scott, meanwhile, loses his daughter (Kathryn Newton) yet again—a fated incompetence that may be the character’s true legacy. With very small powers come no real responsibilities. PG-13. JAY HORTON.

"Mar 1, 2023",NEUTRAL," Since his arrival in the MCU with 2015’s Ant-Man, the solo adventures of Scott Lang have tended to serve as something of a palette cleanser between big Avengers outings. A break from the action after Age of Ultron, a much-needed breath between Infinity War and Endgame. Sure, Ant-Man is an integral part of the MCU at large, but more importantly, he’s the humanity; the affable everyman; just a guy trying to do the right thing by his daughter. With Peyton Reed’s third Ant-Man adventure, Scott (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and the ant-gang find themselves in the thick of it, facing off against the MCU’s next Big Bad. Re-enter Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), following up on threats issued in Loki Season One. Sucked into the Quantum Realm within the first fifteen minutes of the film, the family are scattered asunder and left to fend for themselves in this strange new world. While Scott and an all-grown-up Cassie (Kathryn Newton) try to navigate the tribes of the Quantum Realm, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank (Michael Douglas) catch up with old friends, enemies… and Bill Murray. Also, Evangeline Lilly is there, although she may as well not be. The least accessible of Reed’s three Ant-Man films, Quantumania does attempt to make some concessions to newbies, serving as a fine introduction to Kang the Conqueror. Here, Majors almost single-handedly steals the film from its titular stars, stopped only by Pfeiffer – who proves to be Kang’s most worthy foil thus far. And it’s only the strength of its performers which ground this green screen adventure. Not even Rudd’s effortless charisma can save the characters from feeling lost against a background of grey-brown sludge and unremarkable landscaping. There are some interesting visual flourishes – hey, that guy’s head is made of broccoli! – but this is the ugliest MCU release yet. The cheap airport action of Civil War may have been mocked for its lack of scale and ambition, but at least we could make out what was going on. Hideous visuals notwithstanding, there is some fun to be had in the arrival of MODOK (ugly, but in the wrong way), the brutal final fight, and some of the more out-there sci-fi concepts. Amidst the Kang mythmaking, Reed remembers to make time for Scott and Cassie, giving the film its sweetest moments and the closest it comes to the old Ant-Man heart. Quantumania emerges as one of the weakest MCU adventures so far; an ugly, overpacked mess. Worse than that, in its rush to set up the next big thing, it manages to lose sight of what matters. Look out for the little guy, indeed."

This latest Marvel superhero comic book film sets up storylines for the next dozen or so of the successful juggernaut Disney film and television cash cow. With storylines brought to conclusions for familiar comic book heroes Captain America (Chris Evans version), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr version), Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, this film brings in a new villain in Jonathan Majors' Kang the Conqueror, one that will battle heroes introduced in recent Marvel TV series. Marvel fans will know from the recent Ms Marvel series that Paul Rudd's Ant-Man character found a way to keep himself occupied after saving the universe in Avengers: Endgame, hosting a podcast called Big Me Little Me. This is a throwaway joke in that series, but as Peyton Reed's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania opens, Lang is a world-famous figure, causing head-turns by everyone he walks past on the street in his San Francisco neighbourhood, even his local barista thinks Lang is actually Spider-Man.  At a bit of a loose end - there's not much more you can dream of adding to your resume after saving the universe - Lang is loving the attention but he is finding parenting his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) difficult when she emulates his behaviour, including landing herself in jail for taking a stand against injustices.  There's a bit of a conspiracy going on in their family home, with Cassie's grandparents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and step-mum Hope (Evangeline Lilly) supporting Cassie's rebellion, including her investigations into the mysterious Quantum Realm that trapped her father for years. But Cassie's curiosity gets the whole family pulled into that realm, and here they discover a handful of new friends and an enemy in Kang. For most of Hope's young life, her mother Janet was also trapped in this Quantum Realm - a micro universe that exists at the sub-atomic level of our own universe - and this unwanted family adventure unmasks Janet's closely-held secrets about her time here. There is so much invention, so much visual delight to be enjoyed as the filmmakers create a universe different from our own, with neighbourhoods of this Quantum Realm looking like fungus universes, amoeba universes, or worlds imagined by Russian futurist illustrators like Nikolay Kolchitsky in the pages of Tekhnika Molodezhi.  The visual intensity of Quantunamia helped me absorb and focus the sugar high from the family-sized block of Cadbury hazelnut chocolate I ate while wacthing the film. That imagination looks expensive - there are more than just a few hundred names in the end credits, most of them computer graphics types, so many salaries supported here - and while the film has a bunch of things to pick apart, it's aesthetic and visual enjoyability isn't one of them.  I want to say I was disappointed that it wasn't funnier - director Peyton Reed made comedy classic Bring It On, and Rudd's Scott Lang is usually the light relief in a Marvel ensemble.  But the screenplay from Jeff Loveness has a lot of darkness to necessarily set up Kang as a committer of genocides and establish him as a formidable foe for future films.  For this dark storyline, Michelle Pfeiffer gets the meatier role among its heroes, but the film is held together by the convincing menace and Shakespearean finesse of Jonathan Majors.  There are some terrific cameos including the brief return of Randal Park's Jimmy Woo and I'm sure other media will have spoiled Bill Murray's appearance before I have with this sentence. "

"Feb 28, 2023",NEGATIVE," One of the biggest films of the year is “Top Gun: Maverick,” nominated for six Academy Awards including best picture. It is also the film credited for bringing audiences back to theaters after the low of the pandemic. The film grossed $1.48 billion and is now the eleventh highest grossing movie worldwide. This is even more surprising when you take into account that “Top Gun: Maverick” is a sequel. Sequels and reboots often have a stigma around them as many never quite measure up to their predecessor. But “Top Gun: Maverick” has proven that sequels can be just as good as (and in its case far better than) the original.

"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE," The Marvel Cinematic Universe enters a new decade with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. For those not keeping track at home, this film is the first in Marvel’s all-important Phase 5, the third in the Ant-Man franchise, and the 30th in the MCU. You cannot fully fault the filmmakers for failing to find compelling narratives for 30+ movies that explore variations on the same themes, more or less, as audiences that demand nothing but superhero fare and the greedy studios that indulge them deserve to shoulder some of the blame as well for this ongoing and seemingly endless cycle. And while the critical reception toward Quantumania will remain as irrelevant as it has for all 29 prior MCU entries, the latest Ant-Man movie is arguably one of the worst misfires in the entire multi-billion dollar series, as its level of creativity is, like Paul Rudd‘s protagonist, pretty small. Quantumania finds former Baskin Robbins employee and lovable thief Scott Lang (Rudd) merrily strolling along the streets of San Francisco, his life charmed by his past adventures as an Avenger, as his miscreant deeds have been washed away after helping to save the world. Scott’s biggest headache is his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who at 18 retains the youthful idealism that Lang has lost, even if his humanitarian worker wife, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), aka the Wasp, has not. The Langs are a happy family, rounded out by Hope’s parents — scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the original Ant-Man, and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), the original Wasp, who was previously lost in the Quantum Realm for 30 years after being accidentally sent there by her husband’s size-altering inventions. After a brief sojourn, the quintet finds itself unwittingly trapped in said realm for no particular reason other than to sell movie tickets. The award-winning cast also includes Bill Murray as a comedic villain living large in the Quantum Realm, and Jonathan Majors (Devotion) as the principal antagonist, the evil Kang the Conqueror, who Marvel has been eager to bill as the Thanos of this phase of the infinite Marvel universes of madness. One may fairly wonder how such a star-studded group of actors can produce anything other than an excellent picture. Well, that’s easy — none of them are acting. Instead, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a series of shots of these undoubtedly talented individuals staring into the void, or at green screens. Nearly all of the film was generated via computers — maybe not by A.I. like Chat GPT, but by effects that require keystrokes more than anything else. Upon their entry into the Quantum Realm, the Langs are quickly separated and embark on a quest to find each other. They learn the nature of Kang the Conqueror’s relationship with Janet, who left him stranded after seeing a vision of his world-destroying intentions. Stranded for decades in the Quantum Realm, Kang has built his prison into an empire, unleashing a campaign of terror and oppression against this world of magical and bizarre creatures, and the Langs find themselves caught between the warring factions while struggling to find a way home themselves. From the outset, Quantamania‘s plot is frustratingly uninteresting, unless you are a devoted, diehard Marvel fan. One suspects there are hidden references to Marvel catnip shrunk into the nooks and crannies of the admittedly visually dazzling world that the film’s Visual Effects team created. But it is too exhausting to follow all the fictionalized exposition to expend more energy trying to follow how everything and everyone connects to each other. Director Peyton Reed (who also helmed the first two Ant-Man films) had, like other MCU directors, done a decent job of making these films intelligible to most audiences, as this trilogy stands largely on its own, for the most part. However, as the Ant-Man franchise has continued, that mission has become increasingly difficult, and Screenwriter Jeff Loveness (Rick and Morty) certainly had his work cut out for him here. Worse still, as this universe (or, rather, the multiverses) expands endlessly and anything from time travel to full-stop resurrection is possible, it becomes increasingly harder to care about what’s happening, both in this film and in the MCU at large. As the unimaginable becomes possible in Quantumania, it is hard to understand why the characters would express any emotion about the things happening around them. When Rudd’s amiable Lang seems to really care about what happens to his daughter or acts surprised at a new creature he encounters, it becomes impossible not to wonder, “Isn’t this the same guy who moments ago was talking about how endless and improbable the universe and thus, his life had become?” What, exactly, is the source of his surprise? And, if he can’t be surprised, why would the audience? So even though Composer Christophe Beck provides a wholly original drum-focused score, one unlike any of the prior 29 MCU soundtracks, and even though Cinematographer William Pope‘s efforts shine through the visual effects, and even though Editors Adam Gerstel and Laura Jennings aptly manage the film’s many moving pieces, none of this matters, because it is virtually impossible to distinguish Quantumania from the many Marvel movies that precede it. In one critical scene, Ant-Man replicates himself repeatedly, as he gets stuck in a “probability storm.” Each copy of Scott is wearing the character’s signature suit, except for an amusing version of Scott who’s still dressed as a Baskin Robbins worker. One desperately hopes that this version of Scott would’ve appeared throughout the movie, but that’s not the case, and we’re stuck with carbon copies of the same old concept instead. By the end of Quantumania‘s two-hour runtime, it won’t matter much whether the filmmakers purposefully decided to directly lift ideas, designs, effects, action sequences, and lines of dialogue from movies as far ranging as Star Wars, War of the Worlds, and Titanic, or whether they simply neglected to notice that they were copying not only prior Marvel movies but other, more successful ones. Both incredibly derivative and almost entirely devoid of an emotional core, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is one of the worst films in the history of the MCU, with no real purpose other than as a showcase for Kang. For a movie about Marvel’s smallest hero, that’s a big problem, indeed."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE," Up until now, the Ant-Man films have been a charmingly inconsequential corner of the MCU, offering family-friendly adventures and low stakes stories that work as a kind of pressure valve for the bigger, more centralized stories responsible for carrying the interconnected narrative forward.  Well, that’s all gone now, as Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a full-blown MCU narrative push toward the “Multiverse Saga”, the next block of stories featuring second and third-generation superheroes as the original Marvel stars phase out their contracts. If that sounds like businessy business stuff and not thrilling cinematic storytelling, well, it fits Quantumania, which feels more like an exercise in corporate synchrony than a story anyone was excited to tell. Paul Rudd returns as reformed criminal Scott Lang, now a famous superhero thanks to his role in the time heist and the “Battle of Earth” depicted in Avengers: Endgame. He has settled down with Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, given very little to do and doing even less with it), and is attempting to make up for lost time with his now-teenaged daughter, Cassie (this time played by Kathryn Newton).  Between his time in jail and his five-year stint in the Quantum Realm, Scott has missed about half of Cassie’s life, and this should be fertile ground for a family-friendly story about parents and kids reconnecting, and even the idea of a super-powered “road trip” film isn’t a bad idea, but Quantumania does not let Scott and his quirky friends, accomplices, and family live in their fun little corner, it pushes them fully into the MCU spotlight and none of these characters can carry it off. For the first time, Rudd seems off his game as Scott, maybe due to a combination of boredom and frustration, as he tries to bring the dorky dad energy of Scott Lang to a big, bloated story that really needs bigger superhero shoulders—like Captain Marvel, or maybe the Guardians of the Galaxy—to carry it off. Rudd just never feels in synch in Quantumania, not that he can’t be a leading man, but Scott, as a character, was never designed for that. He’s meant to be the normal guy in a roomful of gods, the dude who sort of fell into superheroing by accident and never got removed from the premises. In the film’s best moments, Rudd can tap into his everyman appeal to play a parent floundering under the weight of regret, but as a superhero, he never finds the right level for Scott, underplaying moments that need square-jawed sincerity and a believable power capability.  Michelle Pfeiffer fares better as Janet Van Dyne, and she capably carries a chunk of the film as she leads her family through the Quantum Realm, her home-away-from-home. She actually could be the believable hero(ine) taking down the big bad, but in the third act, the film shifts back to Scott, much to its detriment. (There is an intriguing trilogy trajectory if these films went Ant-Man, Ant-Man and the Wasp, The Wasp, with the third film solidly centered on Janet, an OG Avenger from the comics, finally getting her moment in the sun.) No one is doing a bad job, you can just feel how awkward the story-character match is, and therefore, Quantumania never really works. There are elements to enjoy, such as the creature design in the Quantum Realm, which is legitimately neat, and some of the visuals are cool. And Jonathan Majors makes a good impression as Kang the Conqueror, or at least one variant of Kang, who has successfully conquered the Quantum Realm. Majors makes interesting choices, Kang is almost seductive when bargaining with Scott, the way he knows exactly what lure to cast and how to reel Scott in, it’s both creepy and effective.  Quantumania works best as bait for more Kang stories, which, of course, we are getting, but this has long been one of Marvel’s besetting storytelling sins, that over relying on “the next thing” means they don’t always nail the thing they’re doing right now. They definitely don’t nail the third entry in the Ant-Man trilogy, this isn’t a satisfying conclusion for Scott, who is essentially unchanged by this adventure, nor a good enough introduction to Cassie Lang as a heroine in her own right.  The Marvel machine is competent enough that Quantumania isn’t outright bad, but like Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, it is frustratingly mediocre, plagued with too much exposition, a story the protagonist cannot carry, and a villain that should have met a stronger, more grand superhero in his proper introduction.  That Ant-Man—ANT-MAN—defeats Kang, any Kang, sort of robs Kang of his inherent threat. Like, how are we supposed to take him seriously, if ANT-MAN can beat him? And yeah, Ant-Man had help, but let’s not pretend like Ant-Man, either version of the Wasp, or the “Ant family” has been built up to the point that we buy they are difficult heroes to confront. Ant-Man is for wacky capers and comic relief in Avengers movies, not exposition-heavy narrative centerpieces responsible for setting up the next three years of cinematic storytelling. It really feels like the wheels are coming off at Marvel HQ.

"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL," Paul Rudd is the second most-likable guy in Hollywood, right behind Tom Hanks. He’s likable again in ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’ so it’s too bad I can’t say the same for Peyton Reed’s third film in the series. Jonathan Majors is compelling as Kang the Conqueror but by the film’s finale his character is diminished to a minor annoyance over a major threat. 31 films deep in the MCU means there are bound to be a few duds. The barrage of overblown effects and a story devoid of emotion makes this entry a bottom dweller. The good news, Phase 5 can only get better. Life is good for Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Rudd). After saving the universe with his time travel idea in “Avengers: Endgame” he’s become a best-selling author thanks to his memoir “Look Out for the Little Guy.” As he walks the streets of San Francisco, people wave and ask for pictures with their pets, and occasionally yell out, “Thank you, Spider-Man!” Scott’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), now 18, has been working with Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the original Ant-Man, on a new contraption that sends a signal down to the Quantum Realm (a secret universe within the multiverse) which sets off Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), the original Wasp, Hank’s wife, and mother to Scott’s girlfriend Hope (Evangeline Lilly). Janet was trapped in the QR for 30 years so when she yells “Turn it off, now!” there’s got to be a good reason. Too late! Within seconds the entire family is sucked into the Quantum Realm setting off a mind-numbing barrage of CGI effects. The secret universe looks like a live-action version of Disney’s 2022 animated film “Strange World” complete with weird plants, giant creatures, and a cute jelly-like critter named Veb (voiced by David Dastmalchian), in “Strange World” the slimy thing was called Splat. We soon learn the cause of Janet’s anxiety. When she was trapped in the Quantum Realm for the first time, she met a time-traveler named Kang (Jonathan Majors) who became stranded in the Realm after his ship’s Power Core malfunctioned. That’s not exactly true and now he rules the secret underworld as Kang the Conqueror, who is supposed to be the MCU’s Phase 5 version of Thanos. Sure, he’s got 40th-century tech and the ability to disintegrate enemies with lasers of energy, but the one thing he doesn’t have is Ortho Home Defense pesticide. Too bad. Majors is the film’s selling point. As a villain, he certainly has the chops and soon you’ll see him as the baddie in “Creed III” taking on Michael B. Jordan. Rumor has it, he took real punches while filming the movie. Of course, he did, he’s Jonathan (insert expletive) Majors! In “Quantumania” the actor’s potential to be a great villain is diminished by Jeff Loveness’ script. The “Rick and Morty” scribe’s listless MCU entry forgoes the “less-is-more” approach the Ant-Man films are known for, neglecting the A-list cast to spotlight the monotonous special effects. The film’s H.G. Wells-like finale is entertaining but also absurd and then there’s Kang’s right-hand man M.O.D.O.K. (an acronym for Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing), a robotic Humpty Dumpty with Corey Stoll reprising his role as Darren Cross who puts the “dic” in ridiculous. The evil floating head with Stoll’s anamorphic face is one of the many instances in “Quantumania” that feel more like a parody of a superhero film rather than the real deal as if Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim were attempting to sabotage the film (which I would be down for). “Quantumania” hints at a father-daughter bonding between Scott and Cassie but it’s a fleeting moment in the Marvel spectacle, and what a missed opportunity especially since Kathryn Newton is so good. The same goes for Jonathan Majors whose appearance is squandered by Reed’s obsession to create a visually impressive world. When I first met my wife, we went on a date to see a Rambo film. As explosions and gunfire filled the screen, I glanced over and found her sleeping. I couldn’t understand how she managed to doze off during the effects-laden finale. I finally get it. You may not catch a nap during “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” but you’ll probably glance at your phone or watch several times.

"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE," As the Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to grow, so does the smallest of its superheroes: Ant-Man, the former thief born Scott Lang, who can shrink down to an insect's size when wearing the right technologically enhanced suit. Charmingly goofy and also plain-old charming because he's played by Paul Rudd (The Shrink Next Door), this petty criminal-turned-caped crusader scampers through his third self-titled film in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — and the franchise-within-a-franchise ramps up its ambition as more flicks arrive. Ant-Man can expand as well as contract, of course, but that isn't new. What's different, and about as welcome as a sting on bare legs at a picnic, is that the Ant-Man movies are no longer happy being largely standalone jaunts. This threequel has a key series-building task first, foremost and at a giant cost: kicking off the MCU's phase five. The perhaps unofficial job, too: bringing more than a zap of Star Wars into this other Disney-owned behemoth. It's lucky that the Mouse House does have both Marvel and Lucasfilm in its stable, otherwise the latter might be all abuzz about the former's latest release. Anyone who fears that too many blockbusters are becoming too similar won't feel fortunate while watching the new Honey, I Shrunk the Superhero, however, which doesn't ever saddle a character with saying ""help me Ant-Man, you're my only hope"", but still includes a scene that basically does the exact same thing. That moment is surrounded by shots of zap-heavy fighting in the corridors of an existence-threatening villain's stronghold that could easily be a Death Star, as even the most casual of visitors to a galaxy far, far away will spot. That said, Ant-Man's current escapades aren't happening in the space above, but in the minuscule realm that exists between atoms. At least it isn't called Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantum Battles. Imagining a world — this very world — where Disney eventually decides to mashup two of its biggest screen properties, and the box office's heftiest hits, is easier than an ant spiriting away strewn food crumbs. It's also a cinch to see Quantumania's similarities to all things Star Wars as the first step in that direction, in fact. Filmmaker Peyton Reed, who directed 2015's Ant-Man and 2018's Ant-Man and the Wasp as well, did add two episodes of The Mandalorian to his resume in-between that last flick and Quantumania. But such a blockbuster team-up isn't where this MCU chapter itself heads in its dragging 125-minute running time. Instead, it has the rest of Marvel's phase five to set up, plus a nemesis that'll linger into phase six — so much so that it feels much less interested in Ant-Man than a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania really should be. That's it's hardly fussed at all about The Wasp, aka Scott's significant other and world-saving partner Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, Crisis), should come as no surprise, then. In the 31st MCU film's opening beats, Ant-Man is indeed the star of the show. He's a celebrity basking in the fame of being among the Avengers and dealing with Thanos, and he's written a memoir about it — a book, Look Out for the Little Guy, that'll genuinely exist IRL come September. But the bliss of Scott's success gets cut down when he learns that his now 18-year-old daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton, Freaky) has been secretly tinkering with Hope and her ant-obsessed physicist father Hank Pym (Michael Douglas, The Kominsky Method). The trio's project: sending signals down to the quantum realm. Hank's wife and Hope's mother Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer, French Exit) is also unimpressed, given that rescuing her from that microscopic place, where she spent 30 years, was no minor part of the plot of the last Ant-Man entry. Viewers should savour the precious time outside the quantum realm in Quantumania; there isn't much of it. No sooner are the Lang/van Dyne/Pym swarm talking about Cassie, Hope and Hank's experiments than they're all transported to said subatomic space, with working out how to get home far from their only worry. Janet had led the others to believe that all she found when she was gone was nothing upon nothing, but entire civilisations and species, akin to Star Wars' different planets, people and critters with a dash of Dune's and Mad Max: Fury Road's landscapes and themes, lurk below. So does the banished, trapped and genocidal Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors, The Harder They Fall), the time-hopping, world-destroying new adversary who likes annihilating things just because he can — and he desperately and nefariously wants out as well. Various past MCU stars have decried the green-screen acting that's burrowed into CGI-heavy pictures, including Oscar-winners — not for Marvel movies — Christian Bale and Anthony Hopkins. Their complaints haunt Quantumania, a film where almost everything around its cast is special effects, and little that cinematographer Bill Pope (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) could do could salvage the feature's murkiness. Marvel's reliance upon pixels can look stunning, as seen in the first Black Panther, but the quantum realm's got nothing on Wakanda's blandest detail. Any sense of visual marvel has been not only shrunk but dulled. Any sense of anything but dutiful interest shares the same fate. So does the personality that was so crucial to the first Ant-Man, with any signs that Reed once helmed Down with Love and Bring It On absent, and screenwriter Jeff Loveness (Rick and Morty) unsuccessfully attempting to balance comedy with a drudging innerspace-opera epic. Marvel has an offbeat problem: maintaining its sillier, more playful side, which is its better side, has proven a struggle in the Thor franchise and the Guardians of the Galaxy flicks (the third of which immediately follows Quantumania, and looks to be nodding to The Fast and The Furious), too. Although Bill Murray cameos, The Good Place's William Jackson Harper reads minds and Rudd tries his hardest whenever the film dares focus on him, the third Ant-Man is as by-the-numbers and tonally flat as the MCU has ever been. Alongside ditching the upbeat vibes, plus all that open and derivative riffing on another screen saga, the scale-tinkering fight scenes that have been prior highlights make scant impression against surreal backdrops where getting larger and smaller barely seems to matter. Leaning heavily upon the likeable main quintet and a colony of smart ants is Reed and company's solution, but they're all squandered. The formidable Majors lives up to his name, though — one that perfectly fits the pint-sized titular character's big bad, and the figure who'll loom over seven more pictures in two years before 2025's Avengers: The Kang Dynasty arrives. The MCU is going massive on Kang, patently; if only it'd kept the Ant-Man pictures small."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE," This is Paul Salfen with your KLAK Movie Minute. In theaters this weekend is Ant–Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the new installment of the popular Paul Rudd-led superhero flick and it’s quite a ride. Of course the ever-lovable Rudd is himself and is charming and fun to watch as expected and our Wasp, Evangeline Lily is solid once again, but it’s the other characters that really get to shine unexpectedly. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfiefer are a joy to watch, especially to see how well they play to what must have been mostly green screen. Kathryn Newton steps way up and into superhero territory as Rudd’s daughter, but it’s Jonathan Majors as Kang that really makes an impact. If you hadn’t noticed how good he is, you will now. It’s also more sci-fi than superhero flick this time, taking cues from Star Wars and getting really fantastical. While it may not be the best in the series, it’s a totally fun installment and one that’s worth seeing on the big screen. That’s it for this week. Join me next week and every week for another Movie Minute right here on 97.5 KLAK and AMFM Magazine."

"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE," Of all the worlds and superheroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - which are endless, thanks to its conveniently plot-driving multiverse - Ant-Man is the only crusader who should reasonably be sent to the Quantum Realm. It is, scientifically speaking (from what I've searched on the internet), a real thing, a world within our own where time, space and physics follow a different rulebook. In ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,"" and most likely not like in the real world, the Quantum Realm is a living, breathing universe, teeming with alien-like species and sophisticated technology, a truly subatomic landscape with its own good guys and very bad ones, too. Fans of MCU will spite me for this, but to the layman viewer, someone who doesn't know the intricacies of the superheroes' universes and long-written backstories, ""Quantumania"" will look and feel like a crossover between ""Star Wars,"" with its legions of robotic, masked soldiers fighting in a desert-esque landscape among creatures that vary from jellyfish with feet to humanoid warriors, and ""Strange World,"" whose own universe looked quite a bit like this phantasmagoric Quantum Realm. Some of the flying beasts resemble amoeba and the entire ecosystem has a flowing synergy that ties every living being to one another. To those who do follow Marvel Studio's overarching plan for its media output, ""Quantumania"" kicks off Phase 5, a collection of films and television shows that veer away from introducing new characters and instead focus on laying the foundation for the ""Avengers"" films slated for Phase 6. ""Quantumania"" is a pivotal entry in this regard as its villain, Kang the Conqueror, portrayed by the devilishly fearsome Jonathan Majors, will be an integral part of future storylines, not unlike Thanos' previous reign as ultimate, multi-film villain extraordinaire. This small amount of intel may help viewers place and understand ""Quantumania"" in the grander scheme of MCU storylines to come and not as just another one-off adventure. Paul Rudd, charming as ever, returns as Scott Lang a.k.a. Ant-Man, who along with his partner Hope Van Dyne a.k.a. Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), have the remarkable ability to fight crime as true-to-size insects with suits that allow them to toggle back and forth between tiny, average and ginormous. Lang's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), a young genius scientist and burgeoning human rights activist, has created a satellite system that allows communication with the Quantum Realm. Naturally, one thing leads to another and bam! She's accidentally flung into the micro-universe of the Quantum Realm along with Scott, Hope and Hope's parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) who were the former Ant-Man and Wasp, respectively. Dr. Hank also discovered the benefits of Pym particles which allow mass to grow and shrink and are integral to the superheroes' powers, and Janet was trapped in the Quantum Realm for 30 years, sacrificing her life for the greater good. To say she has history there is the understatement of the century as Janet was an outlaw and rebel. Most notably, she thwarted the escape plans of Kang, a multiverse-traveling universe-destroyer who was banished to the Quantum Realm.  With Janet back, Kang is eager to capture the crew for their Pym particles which can shrink the power source for his ship and serve as his one-way ticket back to terrorizing the real world. Bill Murray makes a random, though fitting cameo as one of Janet's former allies, and there are plenty of earnest side characters, namely Quantum Realm natives and eccentric critters, to add to the lively, psychedelic world. It's a kaleidoscope of colors with technology so advanced, any and everything is at their fingertips. Except, of course, a way out, which is a frustratingly obvious, unbelievably convenient exception.  ""Frustratingly obvious, unbelievably convenient"" is perhaps the best way to describe ""Quantumania.""  We've seen every obstacle, revelation and resolution time and again, giving the leads very little interesting conflict to work with, particularly in a genre that is constantly pushing envelopes and delighting audiences with big, new and audacious entries. The Quantum Realm is, as mentioned, strikingly similar to that other space movie, if not a chintzy reproduction whose heavy CGI work is like lipstick on a space boar. There is no world-building amongst the locals who serve a purpose to the superhero crew, but otherwise make no mark on audiences. As ""Quantumania"" concludes, it becomes glaringly clear that this is yet another stepping stone film, one that introduces Kang, a villain ripe with potential, into the MCU. "
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,I can&apos;t remember ever wanting to walk out during a press screening of any post-2008 Marvel movie&#44; but I had the urge this time around and wouldn&apos;t have missed much had I followed that impulse&#46;
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL," Marvel got a lot of heat lately for their wrapping up of Phase Four. There seems to be even less forgiveness for the next phase in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, mainly for the inconsistency in some people’s eyes. Some might say Marvel needed to launch with a stronger character brand than what Ant-Man has to offer. Yet, Peyton Reed’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania does something that most critics forget is the point of comic book adaptations — these films are supposed to be fun. Marvel’s Phase Five kicks off with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) taking a victory tour around the great city of San Francisco. He nods and waves to his adoring fans while paying particular attention to the kids. Scott gets some free caffeine from his local coffee shop (but because the owner thinks he’s that other Avenger insect). Scott even writes a book telling his fans to always look out for the little guy. Suffice it to say Scott is on top of the world personally and professionally. He even was given employee of the month. In a film with heavy product placement, where he was fired from rhymes with Raskin Bobbins. Even Hope (Evangeline Lilly) is still in love with him. Of course, even heroes holding the world by a string have their problems. For instance, Scott has trouble getting through to his teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who has been arrested four times for protesting various social justice issues. Cassie has been taken under the wing of Hank (Michael Douglas), who has taught her about the Quantum Realm. They even guided her in an invention that sent a signal there and got one back, to the chagrin of Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer). Why? That is because Janet never explained that the most dangerous villain since Thanos is stuck there. And now may have found a way out. Peyton Reed, working from a script from Jeff Loveness, never forgets the magical enjoyment lens that should be used in the MCU. Here, Loveness uses his comedy chops, fine-tuned during his days on Rick & Morty and Jimmy Kimmel Live, for a very funny movie that excels when the characters enter the Quantum Realm. For instance, Rudd’s Lang and Newton’s Cassie interact with a community of rebels from various worlds. There is a real Star Wars planet vibe with a handful of eclectic Tatooine-like neon-colored, candy-coated characters. The best include David Dastmalchian’s Veb, a slime creature that is obsessed with human, uh, holes. Also, The Good Place’s William Jackson Harper’s Quaz is a telepath with a very dry delivery. Even Pfeiffer surprises in a kick-ass action heroine role. While I still say Christian Bale’s Gorr rivals Thanos as the best Marvel villain of all time, Jonathan Majors’s Kang the Conqueror is primed to put his stamp on that prize. Majors brings a stealthy and stoic menacing quality that balances the overall goofiness while being completely enjoyable. As you watch the latest chapter of Ant-Man and the Wasp, you begin to understand phase five wasn’t launched to place Rudd as the new face of MCU. It was for Majors. His Kang is a standout and sets the tone for the next phase. Ant-Man remains a light but highly entertaining entry in Marvel’s legendary filmography. Reed loads up the film with some stellar cameos, including a welcome return from a character from the original Ant-Man film. Yes, while the film is a good 15 minutes too long, and there is something off with Douglas’s comic delivery, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is pure, indulgent entertaining escapism that never forgets the fun, and is not a flop.

"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL," The great Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda follows up his French bourgeois family caper The Truth with Broker, a sweet-natured, somewhat whimsical South Korean-set drama about human trafficking. If that sounds incongruous – how exactly does one make a sweet film about horrifying exploitation? – that’s part of Kore-eda’s way: he frequently makes fabel-like films about people on the margins whose struggle for survival would make grim viewing if approached in strictly social realist terms. Like his 2018 Cannes-winning Shoplifters – about a family dealing with the fallout from kidnapping a child from an abusive situation – Broker is fuelled by well-meaning characters naively making bad decisions. Or perhaps that should be naive characters with poor judgment eventually revealing their well-meaning natures. It begins with a desperate young woman leaving her infant son outside a church in Busan, next to the so-called “baby box” – a controversial dropbox for unwanted children. As she runs off, two female police officers, who’ve been staking out the church, place the baby in the box, where he’s promptly picked up by two volunteers. The volunteers discard the mother’s anonymous note promising she’ll return and proceed to delete all video evidence of the baby’s arrival so they can sell him on the black-market to a couple desperate for a child of their own. The baby’s temporary custodians, Sang-hyun (Parasite star Song Kang Ho) and Dong-soo (Gang Dong Won), aren’t as ruthless or as heartless as that makes them sound. Sang-hyun runs a struggling laundry and is in deep with some loan sharks, but there’s an ache deep within him that Kore-eda incrementally teases out as Sang-hyun becomes more and more invested in the fate of the child (Song’s hang-dog stoicism really anchors the film). Dong-soo, meanwhile, is a former orphan himself whose own abandonment fuels his self-righteous quest to find baby Woo-sung a good home. Kore-eda approaches this unlikely set-up with a deceptive gentleness, even introducing a rascally, football-mad eight-year-old boy from Dong-soo’s former orphanage into the mix by having him stow away in their van as they embark on a road trip to meet potential buyers. Also accompanying them is the baby’s mother, So-young (Lee Ji Eun), who’s changed her mind about her son, but only for as long as it takes them to convince her to let them broker a deal for a cut of the fee. On the run together, however, this rag-tag group of misfits become a de facto family, lost souls unified by their misguided efforts to save Woo-sung from the sort of limited future they’re all currently living. That this is all going on under the gaze of the aforementioned female police officers (played by Bae Doona and Lee Joo Young) adds an additional layer of implausibility. But again, Kore-eda doesn’t feel the need to adhere to the harsh reality of this world, something he makes clear with an allusion to the musical interlude in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia, a film full of emotional truths but not exactly bound by the conventions of a realistic narrative. That might throw some viewers, and there’s definite sugariness to the film that’s a little hard to take. But Kore-eda isn’t trying to make some laboured point about systemic exploitation; he’s more interested in exploring his characters as they see themselves, which makes for a much more humane film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania launches the latest phase of the increasingly creaky Marvel Cinematic Universe with a derivative looking sci-fi fantasy set in the so-called quantum realm. That’s the sub-atomic world briefly explored in some of the previous instalments, but now home to a brand new planet-destroying villain called Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a tear-scarred villain who’s being set up as a tragic, Thanos-style bad guy unduly burdened by his skewed powers of perception. As the film opens, Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man is coasting by on his post-Avengers fame, trying to keep his activist daughter out of trouble as she berates him for not doing enough to help others. Father-daughter theme re-established, some broadly sketched scientific jiggery-pokery soon sees them sucked into the quantum realm alongside Evangeline Lilly’s Wasp and her newly re-united parents (once again played by Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfieffer). The ensuing plot is mostly gibberish, full of universe-threatening stakes that are too easily overcome. The quantum realm, meanwhile, is a visually bland amalgam of the Star Wars prequels and various Star Trek films, with the most distinctive thing about it a villainous henchman that looks like Humpty Dumpty. All the king’s horses and all the king’s men can’t put this broken movie back together again though. Set in modern-day Lahore, the Cannes-winning Joyland revolves around Haider (Ali Junejo), the youngest son of a traditional Pakistani family who covertly takes a job as a backing dancer in an erotic stage show and falls for its trans female star (Alina Khan). What follows isn’t a standard coming-out drama, though, but a knotty family saga, one complicated by Haider’s strong-willed wife, Mumtaz (Rasti Farooq), a beautician whose position as the main breadwinner for the couple is now threatened by the expectation that she’ll stay home to help her macho brother-in-law raise his children. On paper this sounds melodramatic, but on screen writer/director Saim Sadiq lets the drama unfold in tender close-ups that allow his characters to respond in realistic and tragic ways to the messy complications life throws at them. What follows is a subtle critique of the damaging effect strict adherence to outmoded patriarchal attitudes have on everyone."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,After three movies&#44; and a couple of Avengers appearances&#44; we finally get a Scott and Cassie movie&#46; 
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL," Promotes forgiveness, redemption, teamwork, and ""looking out for the little guy."" Encourages selflessness and helping others (including strangers), even if that means putting yourself at risk. Flawed characters are given the opportunity to redeem themselves for past mistakes. As with most superhero movies, courage, trust, and working toward a common goal are valued. Scott/Ant-Man, Hank, Janet, and Hope are all brave, smart, capable, selfless. Characters with flawed/uneven pasts redeem their previous mistakes. Scott's daughter, Cassie, is clever, curious, brave. She wants to help communicate with, rescue, and fight alongside all sorts of underdogs throughout the quantum realm. The main human and humanoid characters are mostly White. Powerful antagonist Kang (Jonathan Majors) is Black. Background characters are from unspecified alien cultures. Women are strong, brave, good fighters, intelligent, and just as likely to save the day as the brave and capable men. Typical superhero/Marvel movie violence, with several fight sequences and battles, both between groups and one-on-one. It's revealed (spoiler) that the villain of the story, Kang, is a world destroyer who has committed genocide. Unlike previous villains (including Thanos), he has no real attachments and seems content to kill whole armies, timelines, and universes of beings. Many background characters are killed while fighting Kang and his minions; he seems able to disintegrate them. M.O.D.O.K. is a literal killing machine. A climactic fight leaves Scott bloodied, bruised, and near death. Scott and Hope kiss and embrace, as do Hank and Janet. A character makes suggestive jokes about how wild his time with Janet was during the 30 years she was stuck in the quantum realm. A woman warrior is scantily clad. A character expresses interest in Hope. Baskin-Robbins ice cream plays a prominent role as Scott's former place of employment. The uniform, the store, and the ice cream (particularly an ice cream cake) all feature in the movie. All Marvel movies have tons of tie-in merchandise, apparel, games, and more. A long sequence takes place in a quantum realm tavern, where alien creatures and humans drink mind-altering drinks, including a cocktail that translates what everyone is saying around them. Adults drink at meal, and Hank asks a bartender what he has that will help get him drunk. Parents need to know that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the Marvel Cinematic Universe's third stand-alone Ant-Man movie. It follows Ant-Man/Scott (Paul Rudd) and the Wasp/Hope (Evangeline Lilly) as they face a new adventure in the dangerous quantum realm with Hank (Michael Douglas), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and now-teenaged Cassie (Kathryn Newton). There they encounter a supervillain who's even more mysterious and powerful than Thanos: time-traveling Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). Expect typical MCU/superhero movie violence: There's a combination of bloody one-on-one fights and large-scale, war-like battles. Many background characters die, are injured, or narrowly escape death. Two couples occasionally embrace and kiss briefly, and there's a bit of suggestive humor courtesy of secondary characters who discuss bodily ""holes"" and how ""wild"" someone was earlier in their life. Strong language isn't frequent but includes ""s--t,"" ""ass,"" ""d--k,"" and ""damn."" Characters drink and make references to getting drunk. Like the other Ant-Man movies, this one focuses on themes of redemption and the importance of communication, courage, empathy, and teamwork. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA begins with the theme from Welcome Back, Kotter playing as Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) explains how great life is now that Thanos has been thwarted and he's recognized around San Francisco as an Avenger (although he's occasionally misidentified as Spider-Man). He's even written a biography called Look Out for the Little Guy and enjoys family dinners with his now 18-year-old daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who's a budding activist; partner Hope (Evangeline Lilly); and her parents. But when Cassie's science experiment with ""Grandpa Hank"" (Michael Douglas) goes unexpectedly, the entire crew is sucked back into the quantum realm -- the very place Scott and Hope rescued her mother, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), from after she'd been stuck there 30 years. They find out rather quickly that Janet had kept some important details about her three decades in the quantum realm a secret. There's an entire universe of Star Wars-meets-Guardians of the Galaxy-style creatures and worlds down there, and they're all quaking in fear of the movie's tyrannical, genocidal Big Bad, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). He has a plan to escape the quantum realm and get revenge -- and he needs Pym particles to do it. This serviceable third installment strips the Ant-Man franchise of its best qualities in order to promote yet another seemingly indestructible MCU villain. Rudd is so charming that the movie's opening segment in San Francisco will garner laughs and reminders of how Ant-Man, like Hawkeye, is one of the humblest Avengers: a flawed guy who's never been afraid of doing shady stuff to get things done with his crew of misfit (and hilarious) friends. But all of Scott's comic relief X-Con Security pals are gone without explanation (Michael Peña's scene-stealing Luis is especially missed), and all that's left is Scott, Hope, Cassie, and the Pyms. Perhaps because Cassie is basically a brand-new character here (since she was a tween in the last movie), there's less feeling between her and Scott than there was before. She's also simultaneously self-righteous and naive, making her both sweet and unlikable. The quantum realm is a creature fest, with so many beings that it's hard to get a hold on who's from where. Of course, none of it really matters, because the star of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania isn't Ant-Man, the Wasp, or their loved ones. It's the villain, played by the excellent Majors with a solemn gravitas that's usually reserved for DC characters. The time-jumping Kang's backstory isn't deeply explored (there must be more to come in the next film, one imagines), but he's definitely a Big Bad. Kang is a supervillain with no complicated familial or romantic attachments -- just an unquenchable thirst for revenge, even if wiping out entire planets and timelines is what he needs to do to sate that desire. Since Janet is partially to blame for Kang's genocidal antics (in the quantum realm, at least), she's on a redemption tour, while Scott tries to keep Cassie free from harm. Is it worth watching this to keep up with the MCU? Sure. It's hard not to root for the ""little guy."" But this movie is ""just fine"" instead of particularly funny, thrilling, or memorable. And in the MCU world, that means it's second (or third) tier. Families can talk about the violence in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. How does it compare to that of other MCU movies? Is the impact of close-up, weapons-based combat different from that of wide-scale destruction and death? Discuss the differences between Kang the Conqueror and other MCU villains. Why do you think he's so much more serious than many of the other antagonists? Michael Peña's lovable side character is missing from this installment of the series. Did you miss him? Was the lack of his humor filled by the presence of other minor characters?

"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Crawls instead of buzzes&#46;
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL," For viewers with long enough memories, it’s sad to see familiar faces like Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer and even Bill Murray report for duty in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the latest Marvel Studios extra-dimensional jaunt. Seemingly, this is what it takes to stay relevant as any kind of movie star in 2023. The more appealing thing about the whole enterprise is the mental image of these former A-listers hanging out between takes, swapping stories of the old days and competing over who least understands the script. Paul Rudd, never quite an A-lister, has meanwhile settled comfortably into his ongoing role as Ant-Man, alias former burglar Scott Lang – an assignment perfectly suited to his skill set as a funny, charming leading man who has never lost touch with his inner dork. Scott isn’t one of the alphas in the Marvel superhero pack. His big thing, so to speak, is that he can shrink down to ant size or much further, via a suit designed by his scientist mentor, Hank Pym (this is where Douglas comes in; Pfeiffer plays Pym’s quantum-enhanced wife, Janet). It’s not the most impressive superpower, but Scott has used it to save the world at least once, as he’s fond of pointing out. Having started the series as a divorced loner, he’s also found himself an entire shrinking-yet-expanding family, having married Hank and Janet’s high-powered daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lilly, underused as ever), otherwise known as the Wasp. Scott’s newfound respectability brings a bit of a 1960s Disney vibe to Quantumania (facelessly directed by Peyton Reed, who long ago parodied 1960s rom-coms in the inspired Down With Love). Often it feels like the world’s most expensive sitcom, with Scott as the goofy yet protective dad to his teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who wants to follow the family tradition of getting small. Under current Marvel protocols, this could be seen as preferable to her having sex. Still, Scott isn’t wrong to worry: one of Cassie’s reckless experiments soon catapults the whole bunch into the sub-atomic “quantum realm” — a chance for the Marvel army of digital animators to go to town with designs that scream weirdness. That means plants with jellyfish tentacles, irregular formations resembling crystallised toadstools or above-ground reefs, aliens with heads like spinning galaxies or stalks of broccoli. Your usual quantum-realm stuff, icky-sticky but in a hygienic way: none of the visitors get soiled, in or out of the shiny suits. Some of it has the janky randomness we’ve lately come to associate with AI art (which is not to imply such technology was used – but we certainly get a foretaste of how it might be put to work in the future). There’s a comparable randomness to the mix of tones, which is less adroitly managed than the Marvel reputation for skilful storytelling would imply. Quantumania is offered as a breezy, no-sweat caper, but also meant to lay the groundwork for upcoming blockbusters featuring Marvel’s heavy hitters. Specifically, it introduces us to emotionally manipulative supervillain Kang the Conqueror, earnestly played by Jonathan Majors, who signals his deadly intentions by speaking in a gentle undertone and pausing in the middle of sentences. If and when Kang escapes his quantum exile, trillions of lives could be under threat. But it’s hard to take that threat even faintly seriously, in a movie so crammed with conscious silliness, from a twinkling Murray dressed like an 18th century courtier to Corey Stoll as a ranting disembodied head known as MODOK (that is, Mobile Organism Designed Only for Killing: it comes straight from the comics, but the filmmakers are keen to show they know how dumb it sounds). Rudd is supposed to be the one holding it all together, but for all his expertise, his smiley flippancy would be more effective if the movie around him had enough solidity to give him something to play against. Nonetheless, you could see him as the embodiment of what the Marvel Cinematic Universe is all about: a smooth, pleasant surface, tilted at just the right ironic angle to ensure meaning slides right off. Stardom being fleeting, I can’t blame him for seizing his moment."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE," When the first Ant-Man dropped in 2015, audiences had just come from seeing the Avengers barely beat Ultron in a movie that left much to be desired. A nice change of pace, the movie proved to be a low level film and highlight the comedic stylings of Paul Rudd. Since then, much has happened in the MCU what with Scott Lang officially becoming an Avenger and the Blip, and now not only are expectations raised but the series is pushing towards uncharted territory. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania asks its audience to spend time exploring the quantum realm, but I’m not sure it was worth the journey. When we meet Scott Lang again, it seems as though all is going well as can be hoped for. His family is safe, Hope has taken over her father’s company, and he has found the time to write a book. If his now teenage daughter lands in jail for protesting the homeless being removed, well that’s just a small blip compared to the larger issue of her and her grandfather building a signal to the quantum realm. Or at least that’s what Janet thinks prior to the family being sucked into a portal from an invention they had created. Separated from each other, they struggle to get back together and find a way home, a task made more difficult by Kang and his plans for them. Speaking of Kang, Jonathan Majors portrayal of the villain is one of the highlights of the film. Far different than the version we met in Loki, this Kang is much more menacing and intriguing and he plays all facets of him. A perfect blend of superiority and rage, his scenes with everyone prove among the highlights of the movie. The movie is also blissfully two hours and five minutes. However that also makes this the longest of the Ant-Man films and the movie’s editing doesn’t make this feel like a jaunty adventure but rather a puzzle that doesn’t quite fit together. Ant-Man films are at their best when they find the right blend of hijinks and heart and while this movie does have a vein of fun in it, it largely can’t quite nail what type of movie it should be. Integral pieces of information and backstory are doled out at points long after they should and many interesting topics (nature of what it means to be a hero, rebellion, etc.) are moved on from just as quickly as they are brought up. It’s frustrating as a viewer that the movie brings up interesting topics but doesn’t seem interested in exploring them. Perhaps most bafflingly, there are so many interesting shots in this film that are cut before you can appreciate them because they want to ramp up the pace or make things seem more interesting than they are. Peyton Reed proved adept at comedic timing in his career and is more than capable of making these Ant-Man films kinetic, but he and the VFX team dropped the ball here. The movie takes what makes these characters dynamic visually and renders them in a much more generic fashion. By virtue of placing a character that is nearly street level with a universe threatening opponent, you have to make the movie rise to meet it. However Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is largely stuck in needing to be bigger and not quite executing the plan to make it feel grander."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE," On one hand, it’s pretty much what you would expect from an “Ant-Man” standalone film – some light-hearted fun and creative visuals that take advantage of the pint-sized hero. Most of that we have seen before, but what really takes this third solo installment of Ant-Man to another level is the introduction of a villain who is an absolute game changer in the Marvel Comics Universe – Kang. We see Kang briefly in the opening scene stuck in the before – jumping back to Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) now basking in the glow of his celebrity following the events of “End Game.” (He’s even written his memoir, which we hear during the early scenes). Scott and his now teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) are comfortably part of a makeshift family with Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and her scientist mother and father Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Cassie has also taken a shine to the science side, even developing a way to communicate with the Quantum Realm that Janet was trapped in for 30 years. But the invention draws the attention of Kang, with all five sucked into the Quantum Realm looking for a way to get home – with only Janet knowing what dangers lurk there. Once in the realm, director Peyton Reed has a good time creating this world – basically getting a blank CGI palette that he is allowed to shape however he sees fit. The world created is fun and imaginative, a visual delight with plenty of twists and turns as the story moves along. In addition to the nifty special effects, there is a wonderful appearance by Bill Murray. What Reed and screenwriter Jeff Loveness don’t take advantage of is the multiverse element that comes into play here. The “Dr. Strange” sequel and “Spider-Man: Far from Home” did a much better job of breaking linear rules than “Quantumania,” which feels like it is just scratching the surface. But that’s likely because it is all serving as a way to set the table for what lies ahead – with Kang as the new Thanos. But they all take a backseat to Majors, who brings an element of danger that we haven’t seen in the MCU since Thanos. Majors arrives about halfway in and completely takes over the film – a commanding presence that demands the audience’s attention."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE," The critics must be crazy. Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania isn’t nearly as bad as we were led to believe, even if it is far from the top echelons of the MCU. Not only does the film set up Marvel’s Phase 5 stakes and our new supervillain—the multiverse-hopping, super-powerful Kang, played wonderfully by Jonathan Majors—it’s also often very funny and charming, thanks in no small part to Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang. Only Eternals has scored this low with critics, though that also scored lower with audiences. (I enjoyed the film just fine but thought it was easily a half-hour too long!) For me, Ant-Man 3 is fresh, but not too fresh. This isn’t one I’ll be telling everyone to go see, but it’s also not one I’ll be telling people to skip, either. It’s a mixed bag, good and bad. Let’s start with . . . . As I noted above, Jonathan Majors does a wonderful job as the new supervillain Kang (no spoilers about his role in the film and coming films beyond that, don’t worry). Majors is a phenomenal actor and he brings real depth to the supervillain, and even some surprising vulnerability. He’s scary but also a bit relatable, and if the producers of this film had been a little smarter, they would have doubled down on his story, fleshing out his interactions with both Scott and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). Beyond the awesomeness of Kang, I really loved all the bits with Ant-Man himself. I think the second and third films in this trilogy have suffered a bit from not focusing on Ant-Man enough, and making his story too serious. All the humorous bits with Scott and his family and even some of his rivals in the Quantum Realm were really great, and I laughed out loud more than once. A film more focused on Ant-Man and Kang would have really nailed it, especially if they’d played on the contrast between the two. Tonally that might be tricky but I think it could have worked. I also really liked Mondok and his final scene was pretty hilarious. Some of the action scenes were pretty fun as well, though nothing really stood out. Some trippy Quantum Realm CGI bits (one involving a rapidly duplicating Scott Lang) were more creative and engaging than the fight scenes. So, other than Hope Van Dyne’s haircut, what else didn’t work in this film? Well, the title for one thing! Ant-Man and the Wasp makes absolutely no sense here. That was a fine title for the second film, which focused a ton on the Wasp—but she’s a side-character at best here, and putting her character in the title is just bizarre. Call it Ant-Man 3 or Ant-Man and Kang or Ant-Man 3: The Rise Of Kang or something. Then there’s ‘Quantumania’ which is hard to say, to read, to spell, and just makes the movie title way too long. At least Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness was a little catchy (if still a bit long-winded). Plot-wise, the Quantum Realm was a bit goofy to me. Why are there people who look just like humans on earth in a sub-atomic universe smaller than an atom? At least just have alien-looking beings down there. That the whole thing devolves into a boring, generic battle between the good guys and Kang and his legions just seems lazy at this point. Oh, okay cool, the Quantum Realm just has guns and spaceships like anywhere else. How creative! Really, there was no need to make Kang a conqueror of the Quantum Realm at all. He could have just been stuck there, and they get sucked in and have to deal with him. No ridiculously weak robot guards. No rebel leaders. None of that nonsense. Sure, we would have lost Bill Murray’s Lord Krylar and that would be a shame, but overall this setting just never clicked for me. (Kylar could have been an alien voiced by Murray). Also, honestly, it felt a lot more like Star Wars than Marvel! And that final battle felt way too much like Rise Of Skywalker, when they just phone the rebellion and thousands of ships show up all at the same time to join the fight. Still, the CGI was pretty cool and the Quantum Realm’s otherworldly beings were neat. If we’d just had fireball aliens and massive purple glow-whales and aliens riding on stingray-like ships that would have been fine. In the end, the Quantum Realm is both overdrawn and under-cooked. We saw a lot of it and got a cursory glimpse of numerous characters that lived there, and an entire rebellion overthrowing a terrible dictator, but it was all surface level and ultimately felt a little hollow and generic. Ultimately, I was able to enjoy Ant-Man 3 regardless of these complaints. Maybe I just went in with low enough expectations and the movie was charming enough to make its flaws bearable. Meanwhile, the combo of Kang and Lang (heh) was enough to win me over. There are many better films out there, but for some fun escapism and a good introduction to the Phase 5 villain and story-arc, it’s definitely worth a watch. The MCU can, and should, do better, but for a Sunday-fun day popcorn movie it could be much worse. This is another film where focusing a bit more on the script, cutting down the run-time by 20 minutes, and not relying so heavily on big battle scenes would have made for a better movie and a better final score. But this is still better than I was expecting so don’t let a lousy Rotten Tomatoes aggregate keep you away. TL;DR: Ant-Man 3 is a fun if predictable superhero movie that gets a few big things wrong, but bounces back on the strength of its leads, with both Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors knocking it out of the park. As always, I’d love it if you’d follow me here on this blog and subscribe to my YouTube channel and my Substack so you can stay up-to-date on all my TV, movie and video game reviews and coverage. Thanks!"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania felt like a return to what Marvel does best. That is, I realize, the most backhanded compliment I’ve ever given a film on this blog as what Marvel does best is teasing the next movie. Do I want to see Avengers or Loki or anything with Jonathan Majors in it? You bet. Did even Jonathan Majors’ considerable talents make Quantumania more than passable? Not really.  But passable is passing, so I might as well admit that I enjoyed myself enough to recommend getting off the couch and into the couch seats at the theater. After a mostly lackluster and directionless Phase Four, the MCU appears to be sufficiently distanced from Infinity War to start building on the metanarrative again rather than just issuing self-contained movies with teasers for something that may or may not happen in the next decade. A lot of the heavy work for the last few years has been done on streaming, but these feel more like venues for introducing more (and minor) characters rather than developing any of the familiar ones. I didn’t anticipate just how much having Paul Rudd around for the whole movie would help. Scott Lang appears to have stepped into the Hawkeye role of “I’m just a normal guy among people with actual superpowers” and he conveys that sense of vulnerability better than Jeremy Renner ever did. (That’s not a knock on Renner’s acting just an acknowledgment that his screen persona is a bit too brave to play the little guy convincingly. In its best moments, Quantumania works because Scott really does appear to be in over his head — Kang is out of his league.  This means that like a lot of MCU movies this one is strongest in Act II but weakest in Act III. The battles are generic and the solutions are never quite as clever as the setup for the problems. Evangeline Lily gets sidelined through most of the movie — I had to check my notes to make sure this wasn’t called Ant-Man and Stature since it is a father/daughter team-up more than anything else. Michelle Pfeiffer gets separated from the senior crowd of doddering male admirers long enough to provide some expository back story which is, essentially fifty minutes of “there’s something I didn’t tell you.” The art design was kinda there, the creatures a little too much like rejects from a Star Wars cantina spin-off episode, and the treatment of and resolution of M.O.D.O.K. a bit of a dud. But boy oh boy when Majors flares his nostrils or uses his deep, hushed voice, there is more of a backstory in his pained intonation than we typically get in a perfunctory villain origin story.  Also, maybe I’m reaching, but there strikes me as something profoundly meta and on-point in Scott’s inability to understand what he could possibly do next now that he has helped to literally save the universe. A lot of MCU heroes talk about just wanting to have a quiet life with their loved ones, but Rudd is able to make me believe it in ways I just never did with Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye, or Thor. Scott comes across as the hero who perenially has greatness thrust upon him, and I like that element more than I realized. "
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL," What was it Harrison Ford said to George Lucas on the set of the first Star Wars film? Oh, yes, we remember now. “George, you can type this s**t, but you can’t say it!” Barely a minute passes without poor Michael Douglas and poor Michelle Pfeiffer spouting some incoherent, made-up movie science nonsense about teeny, tiny universes that exist inside other teeny, tiny universes. Everything is over-explained. Every second word is ‘quantum’. Most of our players are required to stand around and pretend to look scared, mystified and/or moved by things that will be added later by a crew of CGI experts. You wonder if this is what Douglas had in mind when he answered the call from Marvel Studios. Rarely has a film about a family in peril been so utterly devoid of suspense. The problem, it seems, is that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania exists as part of a larger enterprise. It is here to bridge the gap between one Avengers offering and the next, and to properly introduce the franchise’s next big bad guy (Kang the Conqueror, portrayed by Jonathan Majors). Fair enough, but would it kill them to beef up the story a little? ​We begin on a promo tour. Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has written a book about how he and his Avenger pals saved the world. Being a superhero, says Scott, was never part of the plan, but hey, it saved him from a life behind bars. Unfortunately, his teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has begun to follow in her father’s footsteps and, after bailing her out of jail, Scott wonders if he’s setting the right example. That’s the least of his worries. As it turns out, Scott’s superhero girlfriend Hope van Dyne/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and her brainy old man Hank Pym (Douglas) have been hard at work on some top-secret super science experiment in their basement – and they’ve only gone and roped Cassie into their scheme. Hank’s wife, Janet (Pfeiffer), is a tad miffed. She was trapped in this other realm for 30 years and – oh, let’s just cut to the chase, shall we? The device breaks and everyone gets sucked into the realm where they discover entire civilisations and end up involved in a convoluted stand-off with a muscular megalomaniac who calls himself Kang. Guess how that pans out. If what you’re thinking is that Ant-Man 3 (to give it its shorter title) sounds a lot like Lost in Space, then you’d be right. There is, indeed, potential here for a trippy, high-wire adventure about a dysfunctional clan of geniuses and oddballs doing their best to survive in a distant galaxy. It should be bonkers. It should take risks. Instead, it’s flat, ordinary and largely uneventful, a film that ends in exactly the same spot where it began. That’s not how storytelling works. The awful truth is that, as soon as you take Ant-Man out of a real-world setting, he stops being cool. He stops being human, too, and this soulless, shapeless film knows it, and it seems unsure about what to do with or where to place its protagonist. ​Rudd is his usual charming self, but at this stage of the game, he has done everything he possibly can with a character who is, admittedly, a walking, talking punchline. By moving him to a fantastical new world for 120 minutes, writer Jeff Loveness and director Peyton Reed have all but spoilt Scott’s mission statement. He is supposed to be a former-thief-turned-accidental-superhero. He is already out of place. Why bother sending him to space where he is no longer the star and no longer interesting? It hardly helps that the special effects aren’t all that special, and that the gag rate is surprisingly thin. There is too much talk of things that happened before the audience showed up. There is more, still, of things that will occur in future instalments. Meanwhile, Rudd and Lilly struggle to conjure up an ounce of chemistry between them, and a shoddily edited cameo from Bill Murray goes down like a lead balloon. Oh, and Majors is too good for this cartoon villain stuff. Better than Eternals, worse than the last Doctor Strange. Why does the sun always shine on our lousiest days? Why do people sign off social media posts with “peace and love”? Why – and this is an important one – do we sometimes forget to check our pockets on laundry day? There might be stowaway seashells in there. Based on a series of acclaimed shorts, this Oscar-nominated animated feature asks a lot of big questions and tells of a documentary filmmaker (director Dean Fleischer Camp, playing a version of himself) who discovers a tiny talking shell named Marcel (voiced by co-writer Jenny Slate) living in his Airbnb. Marcel’s entire community has gone missing, and all that’s left is him and his dear Nana Connie (Isabella Rossellini). Hard times, but Dean might be able to help. With a climate emergency in full swing and the conversation about how to power the world without fossil fuels gaining increasing urgency, we no longer have the luxury of being able to dismiss ‘nuclear’ outright. That’s the stance of the small but passionate pro-nuclear activist community who have mounted a dogged campaign to rehabilitate the term for a new generation. Besides the inconsistency of solar and wind, they claim, stigma about mushroom clouds, oozing barrels of waste, and hazardous fallouts are outdated and largely bogus. Frankie Fenton’s keenly observed and warm-humoured documentary portrait has proven a hit at festivals, and you soon see why. Chapter by chapter, it follows individuals from the movement, each with their own communication style and particular drum to bang. Loathed by both the green energy community and the fossil fuel industry, Fenton’s subjects come across as determined outsiders resorting to unconventional means to get their science heard above the anti-nuclear scaremongering. A knock on the door from Peter’s ex-wife (Laura Dern) will upend the happy place he’s currently in, however. Nicholas (Zen McGrath), his 17-year-old son by that previous marriage, has been absent from school for a month and exhibiting troubled moods. No longer willing to live with his mother, Nicholas moves in with Peter and Beth, setting in train a bumpy journey where father and son must get to know one another. All the while, Nicholas’s mental illness not only puts great strain on Peter’s family life and a new job opportunity in politics, it awakens skeletons in the cupboard related to his own father (Anthony Hopkins)."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE," In comic books, a multiverse event—usually characterized by infinite timelines and worlds colliding at once—foreshadows a return to the basics. It may seem counterintuitive: why complicate the story if you want to, at the very end, simplify it? Well, some accidents require complex solutions. Maybe a writer made a choice that fans grew to hate. Remember when Marvel split up Peter Parker and Mary Jane? How about the time Captain America was a Nazi? Whoops! Cue the hero going on a quest through the multiverse, meeting all of their various variants, leading to the moment when they press the magic button that makes their life normal again. (Looking at you, No Way Home.) Tabula rasa. Clean slate. So you can understand why a realm of zero consequences is so appealing to Marvel Studios. The multiverse allows Marvel to twist and turn in whatever way the box office dictates. If something works, great. If not? Magic reset button. You had the feeling that Marvel's screwing around with the idea of a zillion-odd universes would, you know, start to hurt the story. Enter Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, in theaters this Friday. The third installment in director Peyton Reed's Ant-Man franchise is so confused about where it fits into the Marvel Cinematic Universe that it begins to lose all meaning. The first two Ant-Man films succeeded because they kept—pun slightly intended—a relatively small scope. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) was just a tiny hero who shrinks down and talks to ants! Now, the little guy has to introduce the MCU's ""Multiverse Saga."" Sure, ants can carry 20 times their own body weight—but the fate of the multiverse is too heavy a lift for Rudd and his crew. Combining elements of Avengers #8: ""Kang the Conqueror"" and Fantastic Four #76: ""Stranded in Sub-Atomica!,"" our ant family is quickly thrust into the Quantum Realm for a massive adventure. Cassie (Kathryn Newton) does what's very likely the dumbest thing we've seen since Thor didn’t strike Thanos in the brain: shecreate a device that accidentally sends her, Scott Lang (Rudd), Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), back to the place of their nightmares. Immediately, we’re introduced to far too many creatures and characters. There's a weird blob who is obsessed with the amount of holes that humans have! And a robot-like being with a laser cannon for a head! Fun. The Quantum Realm is described as a tiny world beneath our world, and that’s the best explanation we’re going to get. But I have questions. How did all so many aliens and creatures get here? What kinds of beings are the humanoid cameo characters played by Bill Murray and William Jackson Harper? In fact, Quantumania never stops throwing new things at you. Say what you will about Avatar: The Way of Water, but at least we swam with the alien whales for longer than a minute. At one point in Quantumania, our heroes board a stingray-like amoeba to a Star Wars-looking city—and the amoeba parks itself, as if it knew that it was functionally just a bus for transport. Still, Quantumania does have a few bright spots. The brawl between Kang and Ant-Man near the end of the film is by far the best scene—as in Majors's performance as Marvel's big bad. When the CGI onslaught finally takes a breather during their one-and-one fight, you truly feel every right hook and broken rib. But one good scene can't fix a film overloaded with so much plot—and so many characters—that you'll actually wish everyone slowed down to tell their corny jokes.  There's only one way to explain the exiled Kang the Conqueror: if Thanos wanted to kill half of all life to prevent the universe from running out of resources, Kang wants to kill half of all universes to prevent the resource of time from running out. Why? Because the universes throughout the multiverse are inexplicably colliding with one another—which is an idea we've hardly touched on in the MCU so far, despite likely being the new doomsday scenario the Avengers will have to stop next. Still confused? Well, it's only going to get more complicated as each film bleeds into the next. As we learn in the end-credits scene, Quantumania's Kang was just one variant of the villain throughout the multiverse. Audiences were treated to a whole Council of Kangs (Kangses?) large enough to fill a stadium—including incredibly silly variants that I couldn't believe were actually put on screen, like Pharaoh Rama-Tut and the big-helmeted Immortus. If you're worried about trying to keep up with all this for the next three years, just know that they're basically all the exact same guy. Or you could put your pencils down for this next chapter of Marvel films and just enjoy the ride.  Superhero movies used to go something like: a man who became part-spider saves his girlfriend from a part-octopus man. Or, man dresses up as a bat to intimidate a city full of criminals who are even crazier than him. But this? Whatever the MCU is setting up for its next Avengers film, 2025's Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, will take another thousand-some words to explain. Avid Marvel comics readers may have an idea about what’s to come if they’ve read Secret Wars—but how it’ll play out on screen over the the next three years is solely up to K.E.V.I.N. Maybe there's an audience willing to dissect every sentence that Kang speaks, but these films shouldn't turn me into a guy who talks about the MCU the same way that some people obsess over JFK assassination conspiracies. Call me a doctor, because I've got Quantumania."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL," Arguably, the itty-bitty Ant-Man and The Wasp aren’t the most impressive superheroes. So, any new adventure for the self-promoting, mildly amusing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), aka Ant-Man, and his sidekick/lover Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), aka The Wasp, has got to be a blast. Otherwise, both will continue to be pesty bugs barely worth a swat.  After being tasked to make a big deal out of small things, co-writers Jack Kirby and Jeff Loveness don’t rise to the occasion. Their feeble, generic script’s main idea is to export the two insects and their extended families into a wondrous Quantum Realm. (A premise similar to November’s animated film Strange World). The dialogue is anemic too, as “Get to the Ship” and “Don’t’ be a dick” are the screenplay’s most poignant lines. That’s the narrative director Peyton Reed, who helmed the two previous Ant-Man movies, must work with. To build momentum for this franchise and other MU movies, as they intend to expand into a “Phase 5” level, he needed to reach deep into his bag of tricks to make this film a standout. He didn’t.  Scott’s teen daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), a science and technology buff, has been messing around with an invention. Egged on by Hope’s father Hank (Michael Douglas), a physicist, but cautioned by his mate Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), she continues. Presto! The device sucks Ant-Man, The Wasp and their clan into the Quantum Realm.  They’re stuck in a time and place far off. An exotic sphere filled with weird creatures in need of saving. Toying with them, like evil villains do, Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors, The Last Black Man in San Francisco) is ready to manipulate and use the bug family to unleash a power that can destroy worlds, realms and universes. He’s a bad dude. They’re in trouble. Face it, action/fantasy/adventure/comedy fans aren’t that picky. They want what they want when they want it. And it feels like the entire production team is content to just meet genre fans’ bare minimums. Everyone and anyone connected to the un-special special effects should take a remedial SFX course. There isn’t a laser, explosion or freefall that looks remotely innovative. Fight scenes are dull and poorly choregraphed. Nearly all action sequences are immemorable. And when the characters run from or into danger, the CGI screens are so obvious it’s embarrassing. The one visual that lingers is Ant-Man climbing a mountain of his clones. It’s eerie.  The costumes (Sammy Sheldon) look like Toys R Us plastic pieces attached to old drapes. Sets, production design and overall art direction lack a distinct style. That blandness doesn’t give cinematographer Bill Pope much to work with. Even Christophe Becks blaring musical score, with horn sections blasting louder than the speakers at a Metallica concert, don’t add an ounce of energy. In a candid interview, veteran director Martin Scorsese expressed his view of MU films: “… they seem to me to be closer to theme parks than they are to movies … I don’t think they’re cinema.”  The very thoughtful Black Panther and extremely debauched Deadpool beg to differ. But junky, formulaic MU movies like Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania make Scorsese’s case. "
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE," The third Ant-Man movie has a lot riding on its sometimes tiny shoulders, as it’s tasked with both kicking off Phase Five of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) and giving a proper, big screen introduction to new series-long supervillain Kang the Conqueror, for anyone who might have missed the Loki TV series. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania sees Scott Lang / Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and girlfriend Hope van Dyne / The Wasp (Evangeline Lily) getting accidentally pulled into the microscopic Quantum Realm, along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Scott’s now teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton). There, they encounter multiple new races and find themselves pursued by time travelling warlord Kang (Jonathan Majors), who wants to use them to escape the Quantum Realm. If some of the new lifeforms, costumes cityscapes and methods of transport have a degree of familiarity about them, that’s because the Quantum Realm bears a distinct resemblance to the Star Wars universe, something that’s either a canny bit of deliberate cross-promotion, or shocking laziness on the part of the production designers. At any rate, the effects work is exceptional, and there are plenty of entertaining little details in the world-building. The rapport between the characters is extremely enjoyable and the Ant-Man franchise is afforded an extra degree of both emotion and energy with its focus on Cassie (Newton is terrific), though it’s a shame title character Hope is, once again, given so little to do. For the most part, Quantumania sticks to the tried-and-tested Marvel formula, delivering exciting comic-book action (with a special focus on Ant-Man’s fighting style), character-based humour, strong emotion and a few surprises, casting-wise. However, the stand-out element is Majors, whose unsettlingly cool, calm and collected performance as Kang will have you eagerly anticipating his next MCU appearance."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE," If you want to know what’s unimpeachably great about Peyton Reed’s otherwise frustrating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, all you must do is look at the huge face on the teaser poster. Jonathan Majors is, without a doubt, the best thing to happen to the MCU since Avengers: Endgame, and, importantly, he’s not crammed into the same four-color box as every other character on screen. His introduction in Loki served as a decent establishment for their interpretation of Kang the Conqueror. Still, he’s astonishing here for a key reason: In what feels like forever, he’s the only character to say what they mean in a Marvel movie without some manner of jokey eliding of their seriousness. After all, in Kevin Feige’s cinematic universe, the truly damning thing one can do is get in the way of a good time – it doesn’t matter if you destroy a planet or a city or wipe half of the universe off of the map, but if you threaten the Marvel enterprise with some amount of conviction in your heart, you become public enemy number one. This is what separates their best villains (Thanos, Red Skull, that one SHIELD higher-up that Robert Redford played) from those who will be quickly dispatched with and quickly forgotten or from the antiheroics of protagonists-in-waiting like Loki and/or Scarlet Witch. They’re serious, and intimidatingly so.  Majors is astonishingly good at conveying an entire character’s worldview within a single facial expression, and with the amount of information withheld from the audience about Kang’s origins and perspective here, having an antagonist – exiled by an unknown force to, essentially, the Phantom Zone, which he soon, of course, conquers and plots his grand-scale revenge upon the universe at large (while he is also the only person who can save it from the terror slowly making its way down the pipeline towards unaware universes) – you need a person like him to sell the threat he poses appropriately. He’s a perpetually frustrated near demi-god, capable of time and multiversal travel, forced to patronizingly acknowledge the whims of people whose doubles he’s killed thousands of times over, and it’s a genuinely compelling role that he absolutely nails. He’s a full-on Jack Kirby creation brought to life with the dynamism that that descriptor entails. It’s a shame, then, that he’s forced to contend with the goofy goobers of the Ant-Man franchise, who are charming in their own little established world but painfully out of their league here, given the stakes and circumstances. Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), freed by her long-suffering family from the confines of the Quantum Realm after a 30-year stint down there in the last film, has plenty of history with Kang, and she’s, frankly, ashamed of it. So, in trying to preserve some domestic bliss with her husband Hank (Michael Douglas) and daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly), she doesn’t tell them about what’s lurking down there, waiting for the right opportunity to strike. But it turns out that her step-granddaughter Cassie (Kathyrn Newton, who is both the third person to take this role and apparently an amazing golfer) has a budding interest in tech and has, with the help of Hank and Hope, created a sort of satellite that can track things within the subatomic world. This astonishes her father, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), in its good intentions: They’ve been having their own issues in the time since he saved the world with the Avengers, and she’s done so to prevent him – or Janet, for that matter – from ever being trapped down there for an extended period. But Janet freaks out, knowing that Kang exists, and, sure enough, the satellite becomes a miniature black hole, sucking the whole family (and a colony of ants) into the vortex, where the Conquerer is waiting to exact his vengeance after, of course, he forces them to help him free himself from his dimensional prison. It’s a lot. What happened to robbing houses and fighting off Walton Goggins? It’s not a terrible plot, frankly, at least when you put it down on paper, and the possibilities are, in fact, endless: One could do whatever they want with an environment as full of rich potential as this one is. But what’s so disappointing about Quantumania is how committed it is to preserving the sameness of the MCU in style and tone at the expense of any identity it might have, an overcorrection from the days when the brass decided to toss cash at Chloe Zhao to try and give them some artistic bonafide without recognizing that said cash was being watched by shareholders like vultures over a roadside rabbit’s corpse. It feels like Feige and company, cognizant that this is “the birth of a new Dynasty” or whatever, attempted to fundamentally strip Reed of whatever little style he brought to these films. The supporting cast, apparently, never returned from the Snappening (this is a joke, as I’m fully aware that they all probably did in-universe), which means Michael Pena’s not around to do his goofy little summaries and that Judy Greer and Bobby Cannavale aren’t there to provide some additional perspective on Scott’s superheroics and how they affect his relationships with others, chiefly his daughter.  It’s bizarre to think that this is a movie concerned with creating the Ant-Man family at large, but the few folks who might be genuinely opposed to a teenager running about in a size-altering costume and causing trouble in an effort to try and prevent other calamities are totally absent. Reed deserves some props for how deep his roster is – even missing most of these famous faces, I was often struck by how well-used he uses the continuing members of the Ant-Man cast, which is a testament to how charming Rudd, Douglas, and Pfieffer can be, with Douglas being one of the few guys left in this universe who can properly pull off a classical one-liner without it feeling like “banter.” The comic-relief-oriented members of the ensemble do well enough, with Bill Murray showing up for a few minutes to troll Douglas and William Jackson Harper amiably suffering through the proceedings as a psychic who just can’t help being able to read the thoughts of those who are directly across him. Even David Dastmalchian finds himself in the action, albeit in a different role, and earns one of the film’s best laughs. But goofy asides with actors from I Think You Should Leave and cameos from the likes of Gregg Turkington or Tom Scharpling aren’t proof that Reed still had some sort of genuine control over the project and replace what’s missing here stylistically. See, I don’t think the Ant-Man franchise was ever really meant to be the kind of anchor that Feige wants Quantumania to be, and before Spider-Man’s introduction in the MCU, Scott Lang was our only street-level superhero in the universe, at least at the multiplex. He wasn’t rich or a scientific genius or a thunder god or a super-spy or the embodiment of the Greatest Generation’s mythos and ideals: he was a dumbass crook with a heart of gold who fucked around and found out when it came to robbing the wrong house one night. Reed found his character’s identity and world in that difference, and I’d argue that, at least in the first installment, he did a solid job (with some manner of assist from Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish’s pre-viz work) keeping things level and relatively focused on the genuinely wondrous aspects of the character’s powerset. People like to see very small things become very big (and if I were to get pop psychology on exactly why, it’s because the changing perspectives remind us of our own experiences growing in size), and that is a pretty easy sell.  Having his protagonist deal with the pressures of success and fame is one thing – Rudd really is well-suited to the kind of buffoonery that a successful moron like Scott would gravitate towards once they became an internationally famous hero – but using this character as the entry point to this next part of the overall saga makes it mirror Scott’s own sort of dog-catching-the-car purposelessness, and it puts everyone involved in it behind the scenes at the mercy of The Grand Design. I’d argue that this is why the Quantum Realm, rendered with some vivid color in the second installment, feels like a generic world from one of Feige’s space operas. Essentially, this weird and mystical realm, with almost limitless possibilities in how it could be depicted, is just another version of Jeff Goldblum’s world in Thor: Ragnorak, complete with inter-dimensional refugee camps and a reigning tyrant or one of James Gunn’s Guardians sets with a few extra nods to size-changing tossed in now and then. There are a few nice touches – the bizarre living spaceships that the anti-Kang factions use are pretty cool, honestly, and Reed can embrace the ick factor of bio-engineering as a way to make some of the details at least a little more lively – but it’s almost as if Feige just handed him the Waititi playbook and said “Do this, but make it feel a little different. Also, have you seen Dune yet?” Of course, plenty of what’s wrong with Quantumania can also be attributed to the pandemic’s effect on Marvel’s shooting schedule and how they run their sets. This retreat into the fully digital world, with CGI costumes and all, may have been a concession to the practical methods of making a big-budget franchise spectacle under a fair amount of restrictions, but like No Way Home, this ethos sucks what little amount of background vivacity remains in these movies so that it may be appropriately controlled and manipulated to shape the arc of the MCU at large. It is, I guess, what happens when you don’t have a Fantastic Four around to introduce one of their villains, or when you don’t have a Doctor Doom or Reed Richards to kick off your Jonathan Hickman-inspired Secret Wars arc: You load up on the Kangs, try to find his motivations elsewhere, and pray that it comes together quick enough for you to get to whatever further installment down the line will reestablish the suspenseful stakes that you had with Thanos and company just a few years ago without doing the 10-plus years of legwork to get people to give a shit about how it all turns out.  As an Ant-Man movie, Quantumania is probably the worst possible outcome, taking the character to places that wholly conflict with how the character was established and making his powers bland, all to the detriment of its value as entertainment. Still, as another Merry Marvel Continuity Exercise, it could be a lot worse. At least they have a compellingly-acted villain again, even if they aren’t quite sure what to do with him on the way to their destination."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL," Since Ant-Man’s introduction in 2015, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has mutated and transformed significantly from being an interesting franchise movement/experiment, to a behemoth of seemingly never-ending content. The mini-franchise, which started as a series of palate cleansers that delivered a unique and charming mix of heist pictures, comedy, and action, have now become beholden to the Marvel project at large: building mythos and arcs to get to the next phase and keep things rolling. This has proven to be the biggest weakness at the heart of many installments, sacrificing interesting ideas, character development, and daring visuals for the bigger story at hand, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is no exception. Although it might be the weirdest, most interesting, and perhaps most fun film of the three, it still has a lot of the same problems plaguing most Marvel blockbuster: an inability to be solid standalone fare that truly shines. In Quantumania, we find ourselves catching up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, reliably charming and funny), post-Endgame, happy with his life as an Avenger – even if he’s more focused on selling his new book and taking care of his family than actively protecting San Francisco. His daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) is now a teenager following in her dad’s rebellious footsteps, much to Scott’s dismay. It turns out that she’s also become more interested in the Quantum Realm, where Scott shrunk into and came back from when he went subatomic in the first film, and where Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) disappeared for over 30 years after going subatomic herself. Scott and Janet are the only two who seem concerned at this development, which makes sense given their experiences. When Cassie reveals that she’s created a device that sends a signal to the Quantum Realm to map out the uncharted territory, Janet freaks out, and then the device malfunctions, sending everyone into the alternate dimension. They’ll have to sort through Janet’s past, make new friends and allies, and come face-to-face with Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors, exceptional) – Marvel’s latest big bad for Phase Five and beyond. There’s a lot of weird, great stuff that happens in the Quantum Realm as our heroes get separated upon entry. Scott and Cassie are given a lot of time to bond and work through some of their relationship issues as they try to find their way back to the others. Meanwhile, Janet, Hank (Michael Douglas, having a good time by all accounts), and Hope (Evangeline Lilly) are also forced to talk through the last three decades as they work together to get help and find Scott and Cassie to get home. Along the way, they’ll encounter goo that lets you understand all the Quantum-folks’ languages, and environments that look suspiciously like something from a galaxy far, far away.  It’s a rich field for character development and exploration of a surreal, new environment, but it only goes so far. Some of it does pay off by the end, but mostly Quantumania uses the journeys and adventures in the Quantum Realm as exposition for Kang, as well as setting up the next property in line. There are some smart narrative decisions made by focusing on Scott and Cassie’s relationship over Scott and Hope’s (three movies and several forced flirty scenes later and the chemistry between Rudd and Lilly is still nowhere to be found), and by letting us in on Janet’s story as a means of understanding her better as a character. Yet, even in the weirdest, best stretches of this, like when Scott has to endure a “probability storm” to get to a multiversal engine core and then generates endless possible selves, there is still the hovering reminder that this is all an episode in service of a larger story, and the creativity and uniqueness in the movie is constantly undermined as a result. Every time a dramatic turn happens, a weird set piece finishes, or a character has interesting motivations or develops, it’s squandered. By the end, we’re forced to remember this is the first stepping stone in Phase Five, then Six, then the conclusion of the Multiverse Saga, and so on and so on. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a weird, welcome entry in the franchise, and might be the best of the three so far. However, it’s disappointing that something this fun and outlandish took two other movies to generate. It’s also hard to enjoy something when you know it’s only fodder for whatever’s next in the pipeline. Quantumania is fun and fresh, until it reminds you that it simply can’t outgrow the constraints Marvel has put on it."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE," Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) aún no termina de acostumbrarse a la fama obtenida tras haber ayudado a los Avengers a reunir las gemas del infinito y salvar a la humanidad de la amenaza del malvado Thanos. Aprovechando su reciente popularidad, el superhéroe, mejor conocido como Ant-Man, ha decidido compartir sus vivencias a través de un inspirador libro, un testamento de que cualquier persona, sin importar su tamaño, sus orígenes, o los errores que hayan marcado su pasado, tiene la capacidad de lograr enormes cambios en el mundo. Mientras tanto, fuera de los reflectores, el protagonista continúa esmerándose por recuperar el tiempo perdido con su hija Cassie (Kathryn Newton), una joven con una gran curiosidad por explorar los confines del Reino Cuántico, lugar donde su padre estuvo atrapado por un periodo de cinco años.  Es precisamente la fascinación de la chica por dicho universo subatómico la que provoca que toda la familia  sea transportada de forma accidental hasta las entrañas de esta dimensión sin salida. Un multiverso bañado en colores neón, habitado por extrañas criaturas que han formado un frente común para rebelarse contra la opresión de un poderoso y violento conquistador. Tras haber permanecido cautiva en este mundo por casi tres décadas, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) entiende perfectamente los peligros que están por desatarse, aunque el dolor de sus memorias le impide confesar al grupo el duro camino que les aguarda. Divididos en dos cuadrillas, Scott y Cassie encontrarán el apoyo de un clan de guerreros, encabezados por Jentorra (Katy M. O’Brian), mientras que la científica, en conjunto con su marido, el doctor Hank (Michael Douglas), y su hija Hope (Evangeline Lilly) buscarán la manera de poder regresar al planeta Tierra. Para ello, el grupo deberá enfrentarse primeramente al temible Kang (Jonathan Majors), un individuo con poderes sobrehumanos que se ha encargado de sembrar caos y terror en el Reino Cuántico, y que amenaza con escapar para vengarse de aquellos que lo condenaron al exilio en este remoto lugar. Un complejo villano que se convertirá en el principal rival de los Avengers durante las siguientes fases del Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel, las cuales, junto a la recién finalizada fase cuatro, conforman la llamada Saga del Multiverso.  Inaugurando la quinta etapa del MCU, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania ofrece un bombástico espectáculo visual que, pese a ser más consecuente que la mayoría de los filmes de la fase previa, no tiene ese toque épico al que las historias de Marvel nos tienen acostumbrados. Más que vehículos de acción, las dos cintas anteriores del hombre hormiga habían dependido principalmente de la comedia, convirtiéndose en divertidas entregas que aligeraban el tono serio entre las distintas producciones de superhéroes. Sin embargo, en esta ocasión, y como parteaguas de un nuevo ciclo, su estilo juguetón contrasta demasiado con la formalidad requerida para introducir a Kang, y las secuencias de acción tan poco imaginativas hacen que ésta quede lejos de convertirse en una gran epopeya.  Tanto Rudd como Lilly, los personajes titulares de la película, desaparecen casi por completo entre el exceso de efectos especiales que saturan la pantalla con tremenda artificialidad, cediendo el protagonismo a Jonathan Majors y Michelle Pfeiffer. Ambos aprovechan la oportunidad al máximo, pero es Majors, quien ya había participado en la serie de televisión Loki, quien logra cimentar las bases de un personaje sumamente enigmático, el cual tiene el potencial de convertirse en uno de los villanos más interesantes de los estudios Marvel.  A diferencia de las películas recientes de este Universo Cinematográfico, las cuales sirvieron para introducir nuevos superhéroes (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Eternals) o para narrar historias más autocontenidas (Black Widow, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), las apuestas en Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania están lejos de ser tamaño hormiga. Al contrario, las decisiones tomadas por Scott y compañía tienen mayores repercusiones, especialmente al establecer el rumbo que seguirán las entregas próximas a estrenarse. Y aunque la mezcla de comedia y acción no es tan efectiva como lo fue en las aventuras pasadas del diminuto guardián con poderes atómicos, y los efectos visuales quedan a deber en repetidas ocasiones, Quantumania brinda un escaparate de entretenimiento para quienes estén en busca de una saga familiar que explora el irrefrenable paso del tiempo, así como las culpas que cargamos ante la imposibilidad de retroceder las manecillas del reloj para apreciar y re-vivir los momentos más valiosos de la vida.

"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE," Following the success of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, the Marvel Cinematic Universe kicks off Phase Five of its superhero slate with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. After Phase Four theatrical efforts including Black Widow, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and the critically-panned Eternals (the sum of which can best be described as “fine”), can a jump to the Quantum Realm return the MCU to its hey-day glory? A lot has changed since Ant-Man and the Wasp’s last solo film in 2018. Most of the Avengers are now gone and the world is still readjusting to the Blip– which returned half of the Earth’s population after Thanos snapped it away. And if that wasn’t enough, the multiverse is collapsing in on itself, as we saw in Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Apparently, none of this really matters anymore and the filmmakers decided not to let continuity get in the way of middling storytelling. Peyton Reed returns to the director’s chair for this third outing featuring the outlaw Avenger Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and his main squeeze Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as they attempt to navigate the Quantum Realm, the microscopic dimension where time and space are warped and distorted. In this chapter of the Ant-Man saga, Lang is back with his family living a carefree life until his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) does a science experiment that sends everyone, even Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), to the Quantum Realm. It appears Janet has a little unfinished business with the exiled Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) and Scott once again must find a way to escape, this time facing Kang, who’s been spending his incarceration turning his prison into his playground. After Loki’s brilliant small screen set up of the multiverse concept, theatrical efforts appear to be meandering in terms of building MCU ideas for the future. And though Marvel President Kevin Feige called Quantumania “a direct line” into Phase Five and the upcoming Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (2025), all of the MCU story-building elements appear to be shoved into the final few minutes of this feature, leaving the audience with a below average Marvel movie made from a standard superhero blueprint. It relies heavily on Rudd’s appeal, which he delivers in spades, but other cast members such as Bill Murray, Randall Park, and William Jackson Harper are completely under-utilized or in the case of Park, given nothing to do. Some of the jokes deliver, but other lines seem forced or ill-placed. The CGI can be resplendent with innovative world building and creature creations, but there are also moments when it looks like a third-party Instagram filter, creating an uncanny valley that’s more disturbing than dazzling. For example, the MCU introduction of Marvel villain M.O.D.O.K. resembles less of an instrument of doom and more like a stretched-out graphic T-shirt print that shrunk in the wash. The film is actually a bit of a mediocre mess, serving to relay Kang’s development since his appearance in Loki and little else. Though it’s a visual extravaganza at times and offers some chuckles, the story and the character development are subpar when compared with previous Marvel offerings. The film covers no new ground, offers no new concepts, and introduces almost nothing fresh in the way of storytelling or character development. Rudd and Reed made a solid duo in the past, but this time around the formula stands out more than the charm. Rather than get audiences excited for more, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania will likely only add to the superhero fatigue plaguing many moviegoers at the moment.

"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL," I find the following concept helpful: What if the model of our solar system—the sun being orbited by nine planets—is the exact same model as that of an atom? The nucleus being the sun, and the planet-like electrons orbiting the tiny nucleus sun?
 And now imagine, if you zoomed in on one of those teeny-tiny particles with a ridiculously powerful microscope, and as it emerges out of the distant blur … it’s blue? And as you manipulate the coarse and fine adjusters and come in closer … there’s green. Green vegetation! And that blue is rimmed with white. What’s that? Those are beaches. With sand. He’s kicked back, written a book; he’s at Barnes & Noble doing readings, getting celebrity freebies at the local coffee shop, and so on. He likes it. Except for the running gag of getting mistaken for Spider-Man. You may remember, Janet was stranded in there a long time and knows the lay of the land. She also knows Kang (Jonathan Majors), a dimensional conqueror whom she left stranded before she escaped. Kang’s got his power back and is set to take over the entire multiverse, as villains do. There’s plenty of “Avatar” stealing, and copious filching from “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.” Unfortunately, these steals don’t result in magical world-building like those originals, but merely result in a derivative hodgepodge. Rudd’s goofball clowning is always enjoyable. Bill Murray’s cameo allows him to briefly pull the “Ant-Man” franchise into the orbit of his “Saturday Night Live” lounge-singer act, giving it a spritz of that louche, Murray kitschy-ness. Ultimately, though, the quantum realm’s silly treatment bored me silly. Hopefully, the next one gets back to some believable drama, character interaction, and a less-is-more approach to the Marvel Universe’s crazy-for-Cocoa-Puffs overly liberal reliance on CGI."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE," It’s becoming increasingly difficult to rank the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) — not only are they becoming ridiculously multitudinous, but they’re also becoming more and more splintered from one another. Now, that latter part isn’t always a bad thing — if anything, Marvel’s need to shoehorn the “big picture” into every film was what dragged some of the previous phases down. But this relentless churning out of new products is wearing thin, and as a result viewers (and reviewers) are becoming less and less forgiving of the missteps — sure, the films are still essentially printing money, but the aftertaste for some of the less inspiring efforts (I’m looking at you, Love & Thunder) is increasingly bitter. That’s part of what makes Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania (hereafter to be referred to as simply Quantumania because seriously with these titles, Marvel) such a pickle. It’s not a bad film. There are some truly fun pieces to it, some genuinely inventive and impressive visuals, and a mostly likable cast. But it doesn’t do enough to separate itself from the blurred, messy palette that the MCU has become to truly stand out. It’s … fine. Let’s back up. The film stars the always amiable Paul Rudd, gamely continuing as the clever reformed criminal Scott Lang, now known as Ant-Man and his ever-expanding Ant-family (sure, let’s call them that) including Hope Van Dyne aka The Wasp, and Hope’s newly reunited parents Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Also along for the ride this time out is Cassie Lang, Scott’s daughter (Kathryn Newton). As is usually the case in these parts, their scientific inquisitiveness leads to mayhem as an experiment that Cassie is working on results in all five of them being sucked into the Quantum Realm, a weird, wild world-beneath/within-the-world where it seems like anything is possible and the natural laws don’t apply. Trouble arises when they realize that an alien conqueror known as Kang (Jonathan Majors) now rules the Quantum Realm with an iron fist, and seeks to use Scott and family to escape it and rampage across both the universe and multiverse. Obviously, they must step up to stop him, and along the way learn each other’s secrets, stand up for what’s right, and generally do their heroic thing. The film has a number of things working in its favor — the cast is mostly excellent. Majors is terrific as the mysterious, dangerous, yet almost seductively soft-spoken Kang. Rudd continues to cheerfully wander through the MCU in a seemingly carefree fashion, giving “I’m just happy to be here” vibes even when you know he isn’t really trying. Douglas and Pfeiffer could play these roles in their sleep, and while Douglas often appears to be, Pfeiffer is giving it her all and her character shines for it. Kathryn Newton is a pleasant surprise as the smart, hopeful Cassie, a character who is well fleshed-out as a somewhat naïve kid who just wants to stand up for the little guy. Evangeline Lilly is … well, she’s there. Truth be told, the writers don’t give her much to do, and she doesn’t do much with the little that she has.  The real star of the show is meant to be the Quantum Realm itself, and for the most part? It is. It’s a bright, imaginative world full of bizarre life forms and fun characters, particularly the rebel leader Jentorra (Katy O’Brian) and her translator/sidekick Veb, a goofy gelatinous blob voiced by David Dastmalchian (who interestingly also plays Kurt in the previous Ant-Man films). It’s a mostly fun, if not particularly memorable romp across this strange landscape, and director Peyton Reed (who helmed the first two films) handles it all capably enough. The jokes are good, the cast is good, and the scenery is pretty (and the 3-D works decently enough). The question ultimately is, should we be expecting more? This is the 31st entry into the MCU and it is increasingly feeling like the well is running dry. It’s not helped by yet another CGI slugfest of a finale — listen, I get that it’s a superhero film and CGI is sort of required on a larger scale. But this continuing trend of the plucky heroes facing off against hordes of faceless, computer-generated creatures who are all identical save for a lieutenant or two is getting not just tiresome, but tedious. That tediousness is not helped by a two-hour runtime - there is a bevy of expository scenes that could have been trimmed easily enough. 

In the end, I suppose the problem is that the MCU thinks we do want more, but they’re all too often conflating more with better. I want better. I want the sense of wonder that we got in the first few films back. Maybe that’s no longer reasonable, but then again, I look at Wakanda Forever and Shang Chi and the Ten Rings and I think that … maybe it’s possible. But Marvel needs product, and they refuse to let up on the gas for fear of losing ground, resulting in films like Quantumania — films that are fine, but that also feel like little more than filler. Films that despite being filler, are leaving us feeling increasingly empty. "
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL," We’ve now reached film 31 and Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s increasingly baroque franchise. Four years after Avengers: Endgame’s false finale, Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is still basking in his role in reversing Thanos’s genocidal Blip, and reacting to the MCU’s version of the pandemic by semi-retiring from Avenging for some Me time. Until, that is, his wife the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), their now adult daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) and original Ant-Man Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) ill-advisedly contact the Quantum Realm, and the whole Ant-family are sucked into its subatomic cosmos, where the next Avengers arch-villain, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors, pictured right with Rudd), awaits. Kang is first glimpsed in flashback as an apparent fellow outcast befriending original Wasp Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) during her 30-year Quantum exile, only to be revealed as a vicious, time-bending Genghis Khan. Majors’ mournful and dreamy presence is matched by Pfeiffer’s feline, almost feral inscrutability as her long, dirty war as an anti-Kang rebel (“Or terrorist…” she accepts) is confessed. Pfeiffer’s glamorous potency has only grown, and van Dyne and Kang feel like the film’s true antagonists, van Dyne hardly able to keep her hands off him to finish their duel. Rudd’s affable everyman, Lily’s uncompromisingly tough Wasp, Douglas’s borderline hippie Boomer (“Now, socialism’s a loaded term…” he enthuses of his ants’ communal skills) and Newton’s fresh, fearless Gen Z idealist complete a likeable gang as they navigate Kang’s kingdom. Gauzily beautiful CGI world-building has become commonplace, but the Quantum Realm, with its Dune and Star Wars-like vistas and insectile vehicle wing scything through rock, is more appealing than Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness’s prosaic acid visions, or Avatar’s pedestrian eco-wonders. Marvel’s recent penchant for surrealism meanwhile finds Lang claustrophobically buried beneath a pile of split personalities, a nightmare resolved by him topping a tottering Ant-Men hill. The true eeriness of cinema’s first subatomic flirtation, as the hero of The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957) finally fell beyond our ken, isn’t touched. In Alan Moore’s savagely funny comics industry roman a clef What We Can Know About Thunderman, a disillusioned ex-comics writer compares comics fans to junkies, reaching back to “the angelic purity of that first hit” with diminishing returns. “What make the comics fan’s dilemma’s worse,” he continues, “is that the “first hit” they hope to recreate with each month’s issue is the irretrievable, lost rush of their own childhoods.” In MCU terms, you only need to consider Shane Black’s slyly subversive Iron Man 3 (2013), the airy comedy and operatic gravitas of Joss Whedon’s Avengers Assemble (2012) and the Russos’ final Avengers Gotterdammerung to acknowledge the fading buzz. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is, though, a solid kids’ s.f. adventure film, recalling Fantastic Voyage (1966) or The Time Machine (1960) as its suburban super-family explores weird new worlds. Tentatively pushing into broader fantasy cinema, it retains frissons for those of us who did grow up having our imaginations blown open by Jack Kirby. One incredible bit of shrinking does offend. The film is “based on Marvel comics”, with individual creators such as Kirby, Lee and Larry Lieber, prominently credited in the past, now reduced to corporate small print."

As West Side Story composer Leonard Bernstein, Bradley Cooper captures his incandescent musical gift, joie de vivre, reckless prankishness, inwardness and performative ebullience, his bisexual seductiveness and utter selfishness. As his Broadway star wife, Felicia Montealegre, Carey Mulligan is even better. We feel her radiant intelligence and big heart, the spark between them and her exasperation when he courts handsome youths at their legendary posh parties. —Tim Appelo (T.A.) The Pulitzer Prize–winning 1982 novel by Alice Walker, 79, is strong medicine. The Color Purple Broadway musical version has been adapted for the screen, following the 1985 drama from Steven Spielberg, 77. The movie musical about Celie — an abused orphan in the Deep South suffering repeated abominations until she finally gets out from under and finds redemption — boasts an unbeatable cast: Fantasia Barrino as the put-upon heroine; a vibrant Taraji P. Henson, 53, as Shug Avery, the singer who escaped their hometown; and Rustin’s Colman Domingo, 54, as the meanest, orneriest, downright evil Mister. The costumes, vocal talent and energetic production numbers are first-rate. Yet the story’s pile-on of horrors — incest, rape, baby theft, physical abuse, soul-crushing incarceration — make for a discordant mix of the feel-good and the feel-worse. —Thelma M. Adams (T.M.A.) Ferrari is sleek, fast and dangerous. Adam Driver steers the thrilling biopic with a gripping, mature performance as graying Italian motor company owner Enzo Ferrari. The racer-turned-entrepreneur finds himself at a crossroads in 1957. His company is in crisis. Given that it takes a village to manufacture exquisite cars for consumers, as well as Formula 1 racers, the local economy weighs on his broad shoulders. His marriage to Laura (a searing Penélope Cruz) has withered under the pressure of his ambition and their only son’s death. His long-term mistress, Lina Lardi (a plummy Shailene Woodley), comforts Enzo, but Lina insists her lover acknowledge paternity of their boy. That revelation would detonate the fiery Laura. Under these high stakes, nimble director Michael Mann, 80, balances the human crisis with riveting racing scenes climaxing in the Mille Miglia sequence, a thousand-mile competition across Italy. Action and soul: Ferrari is a fierce, moving Oscar competitor by a modern master. —T.M.A. Does God exist? What would 20th-century intellectuals Sigmund Freud (Anthony Hopkins, 85) and Oxford don C.S. Lewis (Matthew Goode) have discussed if they’d met in Freud’s London townhouse in the waning days of the pain-wracked father of psychoanalysis? As England enters World War II, the men circle each other, poking at past traumas and issues of faith over a single soggy afternoon. This kind of historical two-hander, perfected in Frost/Nixon and The Queen, is a narrative trick, like a locked-room mystery. Despite the fascinating subject, the challenge is to fully develop the characters, aim them at each other and await fireworks. Unfortunately, these screenwriters feel like they’re struggling to strike a wet match. Moments of spark exist: when WWI vet Lewis freaks out during an air raid or when Freud defensively refutes his own twisted relationship with his daughter, child psychiatry pioneer Anna Freud (Babylon Berlin’s memorable Liv Lisa Fries). Yet Freud’s Last Session never quite catches fire. —T.M.A. The Boys in the Boat is 62-year-old director George Clooney’s Chariots of Fire. That champion won four Oscars in 1982. This gorgeously filmed and scored (also dated and predictable) drama stirs up the real-life underdog tale of the University of Washington JV crew team. It’s the Depression; adversity reigns. “Hobo” Joe Rantz (tall, towheaded Callum Turner) has never attended a regatta, but the student’s been living rough and tuition’s overdue. He tries out, hoping for a cot and three squares. Crusty Coach Al Ulbrickson (a dour Joel Edgerton) recruits the newbie, while the university threatens to gut his budget. Coach needs a win — and gets one (triumphant cheering!), as his JV Huskies flex their biceps, row, row, rowing their shell all the way to the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Nodding to the past, there’s a brief encounter with Olympian Jesse Owens, and the bonus of aggravating Adolf Hitler, a peevish mustached man observing from the stands. —T.M.A. Bummed by Part 1’s finale, the death of Diana? In its final six episodes, The Crown moves on to happier times: the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II (Imelda Staunton, 67), the marriage of Prince Charles (Dominic West, 54) and Camilla (Olivia Williams, 55) and the college romance of Prince William (Ed McVey) and Kate Middleton (Meg Bellamy). Sorry, no Prince Harry and Meghan Markle romance on this show (creator Peter Morgan, 60, has suggested that those events are too recent to be included). The latest Japanese-produced Godzilla movie from Japan's Toho Studio takes the character back to his roots even as it reinvents him. Set in the late 1940s, it focuses on a group of ordinary citizens, including an ex-navy pilot who rejected a kamikaze mission, and a young woman who takes in an orphaned girl. They embark on a people's crusade against Godzilla, a dinosaur-like creature made gigantic by atomic testing, because the government refuses to take responsibility for dealing with him. Borrowing from an array of classic movies, including the original Jaws, this is a rare giant monster movie where the human relationships are as compelling as the scenes where the big guy stomps and incinerates cities. —Matt Zoller Seitz (M.Z.S.) Jeffrey Wright, 58, owns 2023. The brilliant actor delivered a mighty profile as Rustin’s Rep. Adam Clayton Powell and now carries Cord Jefferson’s brainy, acerbic comedy as the enraged Thelonius “Monk” Ellison, an academic whose latest erudite novel is a least-seller. When he encounters a Black woman novelist whose breakout debut employs young urban speech, the writer confronts market realities. As Monk attempts to prove that he, too, can write pandering fiction, he gets drawn back into his affluent family’s orbit. Mother Leslie Uggams, 80, and siblings Tracee Ellis Ross, 51, and Sterling K. Brown form a formidable family unit (with their New England beach house, the Ellisons are more seaside lane than city street). Both a family dramedy and a sharp take on publishing’s failures, American Fiction also reflects the concerns of a microcosm of Black artists working in Hollywood, navigating systemic racism while expected to deliver stories with “street cred,” whatever that means — and to whom — on any particular day. —T.M.A. Timothée Chalamet exudes wide-eyed charm as chocolatier Willy Wonka struggling to set up his first shop as a 20-something orphan. (Curiously, he flashes no hint of the menace or cynicism that Gene Wilder famously brought to the role in the original 1971 film.) This sunshiny Wonka is surrounded by an overstuffed cast that includes a plumped-up Keegan-Michael Key, 52, Olivia Colman (in full camp mode) and Hugh Grant, 63 (who goes all in as a diminutive Oompa Loompa). Paul King, the filmmaker behind the two justly praised live-action Paddington movies, brings a visual flair to the enterprise, which boasts several well-choreographed production numbers and new songs that mesh nicely with classics such as “Pure Imagination.” The candy-colored visuals go a long way to compensate for a script that can be a muddle, stretched taffy-thin by too many villains, subplots and characters who are not given much to do. —Thom Geier (T.G.) Among the most chilling photographs displayed at Berlin’s Topography of Terror museum is this image: smiling female Auschwitz guards enjoying their day off, steins raised, at a beer garden. Jonathan Glazer, 58, sets his Oscar-bound Holocaust drama The Zone of Interest nearby, at the compound of Camp Commandant Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel, Babylon Berlin) and his wife, Hedwig (Sandra Huller, also in the much-buzzed Anatomy of a Fall). Their happy home, with its lush garden (fertilized with suspicious ash) and playful children, shelters a family striving for a bourgeois life within sniffing distance of the spewing chimneys at the infamous concentration camp. Like the photo at the Topography of Terror, the movie shows the banality of wickedness. For the Höss family, life goes on amid the scurrying, starving prisoner-servants underfoot as the patriarch rises due to his genocidal efficiency. Their prosperous garden of evil, fueled by denial, is an atrocity of complicity, and a timely remembrance. —T.M.A. Emma Stone goes far out on a limb — and then leaps without a net — in her second outrageous collaboration with Yorgos Lanthimos, 50 (The Favourite). Stone delivers a sexy, physically demanding and outlandish performance that exists in an artistic universe far, far away from the mainstream gloss of Spiderman’s saucy girlfriend Gwen. She plays Bella Baxter, a young suicide given an electric shock at a second life by the compassionate but cray-cray scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter (a sublimely ridiculous Willem Dafoe, 68). His bumpy, scarred visage reflects his predilection for self-experimentation, while Bella is his beauty. Mark Ruffalo, 56, flexes his comic chops as a Bella-obsessed gent who has no idea what she’s capable of — or of his own limitations. Part Frankenstein, part Galatea, Bella has a learning curve that’s swift, unexpected and driven by unrestrained appetites. Although Poor Things occasionally careens into extreme whimsy, it’s a gorgeously shot, designed and costumed portrait of an incomparable woman on the verge of a fantastical breakthrough. —T.M.A. Long ago, when my two grown kids were little, I adored animation. Then it became something like eating too many hot dogs — I never again craved wieners or hyper cartoons. The major exception is the creations of Japanese genius Hayao Miyazaki, 82. His latest movie is true to form: unhurried, tender and wise. Nearly every frame of this artistic masterpiece inspires awe. His visions of undulating waters, flickering flames and sunlight cracking cloud cover have sublime detail, composition and color. The story itself offers wonder, humor and life lessons that don’t reduce to “Eat your broccoli.” The hero of this feature, which Miyazaki claims to be his last, is a motherless boy. Mahito encounters a heron, a magical creature symbolizing good luck, a fowl capable of moving among three elements: earth, water and air. Together, bird and orphan cross the thin membrane between life and death, encountering strange and marvelous creatures, and inhabiting a visually thrilling story that represents the very best in bold contemporary animation and popular art. —T.M.A. Sam Esmail, best known for creating Mr. Robot, directed and co-adapted this movie based on the unsettling best-selling book. A family of four (led by Julia Roberts, 56, and Ethan Hawke, 53) rents a ritzy vacation home on Long Island — only to be interrupted by a man and his daughter (Mahershala Ali and Myha’la Herrold), who turn up claiming the house is really theirs and a cyberattack has forced them to seek shelter in a familiar place. Prepare to be unnerved in all the right ways. Like the real Mary Kay Letourneau — jailed for bedding a 12-year-old she later married and had children with — this film’s Gracie (Julianne Moore, 62) was jailed for having sex with young Joe (Charles Melton, 32). Now they’re married and about to send their teens off to college. She strenuously denies she ever did anything wrong, though Joe is having midlife doubts. Director Todd Haynes, 62, makes it even more unsettling by introducing TV star Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), who’s going to play Gracie in a movie, so they let her live with and study them way too intimately. The Joe-Gracie dynamic is like Gus Van Sant’s To Die For; the Elizabeth-Gracie clash recalls Ingmar Bergman’s Persona. The result is a creepy master class in acting.  This account of the warrior ruler who defined 19th century Europe is the sort of stuff epic director Ridley Scott, 85, eats for breakfast. Here he reunites with his Gladiator villain Joaquin Phoenix, whose take on Napoleon is frequently fresh and often funny (deliberately so). Scott brings an almost classical sense of spectacle to the often pulpy script by David Scarpa and gives each detailed battle scene its own distinct color palette. As Napoleon’s love Josephine, Vanessa Kirby is an apt volleyer for Phoenix’s eccentricity. The movie’s 158-minute length is substantial, but given how eventful its subject’s life was, Napoleon practically gallops along. —Glenn Kenny (G.K.) Set 64 years before the 2012 hit about Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), the young badass who volunteered to fight to the death on TV in a dystopian future, the Hunger Games prequel stars not Lawrence but Rachel Zegler (from the West Side Story remake) as fighter Lucy Gray. It’s mainly the origin story of future villain Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth). Like Anakin Skywalker before he morphed into Darth Vader, Snow starts off sympathetic, an ambitious but nice guy from a genteel but financially strapped family. He falls for Lucy (who has a Southern accent for some reason and dresses and sings like a minor country star), whom he’s assigned to mentor to win the deadly game. At 157 minutes, it’s overlong, but Blyth and Zegler have chemistry and real acting chops, and his not-so-heroic journey is a nicely nuanced portrait of how someone started out before breaking bad. —Dana Kennedy (D.K.) Socially awkward scholarship nerd Barry Keoghan (The Banshees of Inisherin) develops a possibly fatal attraction to tall, charismatic rich kid Jacob Elordi (Elvis Presley in Priscilla) in this satirical drama written and directed by Emerald Fennell, following up her acclaimed Promising Young Woman. It’s as if the filmmaker pureed Joseph Losey’s 1963 class-clash drama The Servant, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1968 satire Teorema and bits of Monty Python and Peter Greenaway, and baked them in an overheated oven. Consistently perverse and often visually startling, it’s nevertheless weirdly unsatisfying. But it’s worth it to see Richard E. Grant, 66, and Rosamund Pike, highly entertaining as Elordi’s dotty parents. —G.K. The enormous potential of historical movies is to resurrect heroes scratched from the official record — like Bayard Rustin. The charismatic, gay believer in Gandhi's peaceful civil disobedience orchestrated Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1963 March on Washington in a matter of weeks. Oscar-bound Colman Domingo, 53, brilliantly embodies the Civil Rights grassroots activist while showing a powerful man with a joy for living and compassion for his fellow men. The tragedy — and the root of the film’s complexity — is that Rustin’s sexuality put him at odds with some in the movement’s inner circle, revealing that their dedication to equality had limits. With exquisite music from Branford Marsalis, 63, and a stellar supporting cast including Aml Ameen as Martin Luther King Jr. and Jeffrey Wright, 57, as Rep. Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Rustin is a bold and generous movie that sets its conventional biopic wrapper on fire. —T.M.A. Director Alexander Payne, 62, made actor Paul Giamatti, 56, famous in his 2004 wine-country comedy Sideways. They reunite in an Oscar-touted, record-setting Toronto Film Festival hit about a curmudgeon (Giamatti’s specialty) who teaches at a New England prep school and is stuck on campus to babysit a few students over Christmas break in the early 1970s. He bonds with one chronic misfit kid (Dominic Sessa) and the school’s cook (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), who’s mourning her son, a former student at the school who was accepted at Swarthmore but, cash-poor, was sent to die in Vietnam. It’s a hilarious, poignant movie in a beautiful, character-rich retro-1970s style. It’s a Christmas movie as uplifting as the saddest of Christmas songs, and as full of hope against all odds. —T.A. Annette Bening is generating Oscar buzz for this biopic of Diana Nyad, a competitive swimmer who long dreamed of swimming from Cuba to Florida. Decades after a failed attempt at age 28, she returned to the waters to try again. And again. And again. With the support of a loyal friend (Jodie Foster, 60) and coach (Rhys Ifans, 56), she eschews a shark cage and battles both jellyfish and the elements in the feel-good story of one stubborn and determined woman. Lily Gladstone is the beating heart of Martin Scorsese’s historical true-crime drama about the reign of terror in 1920s Osage County, Oklahoma. The wealthy diabetic Mollie Burkhart comes to represent the Osage Nation, who are living in frontier luxury after oil was discovered beneath their communal land. Scorsese, 80, lushly re-creates the oil-rush backwater, with its muddy streets, fancy motorcars and tribal pageantry. However, the director miscasts 48-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio as 28-year-old Ernest Burkhart, Mollie’s white seducer. They wed but the seemingly dutiful husband has divided loyalties, remaining obligated to his uncle, rancher William Hale (quietly terrifying Robert De Niro, 80). Hale architects a murderous conspiracy to profit from the Osage birthright. As the body count rises, including Mollie’s two sisters, coincidence turns to conviction — and the greedy culprits must be brought to justice. The juicy period piece based on the nonfiction bestseller by David Grann gets the Hollywood star treatment, but a multipart series with age-appropriate male stars might have better-served the grim chapter’s complexities. —T.M.A. Writers Sandra (standout Sandra Hüller) and Vincent (Swann Arlaud) share a remote alpine chalet with their 11-year-old son, Daniel, but their marriage is strained. What makes this elegant, gripping crime thriller (and Cannes Film Festival winner) unusual is that the pot never boils. When an attractive journalist comes to interview the more successful Sandra, an unseen Vincent blasts music to disrupt their conversation. How passive-aggressive — or is his behavior something angrier? Later, he tumbles from the third-floor window, bloodying the snow below. The narrative pivots, becoming a courtroom drama with Sandra in the dock, accused of suspicious death. Her vision-impaired son is the sole material witness. Daniel has knowledge of what occurred in the house — but how reliable is he? Is he loyal to his surviving mother, or to his late father? Did Sandra or didn’t she? If only those chalet walls could talk. —T.M.A. Ounce by ounce of plutonium, this biopic of the father of the atomic bomb is pretty genius — but it’s no Albert Einstein (played by Tom Conti, 81, in an essential cameo). The story ricochets through time and space fast as a photon, plotting the arc of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Oscar-bound Cillian Murphy). As head of the Manhattan Project, the left-leaning, womanizing physicist passionately pursues pioneering atomic science. But he can’t live with his baby, the bomb that decimated Hiroshima, ending World War II. The sprawling drama is a dazzling cinematic achievement boosted by muscular performances from Robert Downey Jr., 58, Matt Damon, 52, and Jason Clarke, 54, and a huge cast of characters with complicated collisions. Showstopper Florence Pugh seduces as the communist mistress Oppie dumps for career and the missus (Emily Blunt). Perhaps in trimming the story to three hours, some of the male-female narrative connective tissue was cut, which may be why, for all its fascinating moving parts, the busy biopic isn’t more emotionally explosive. —T.M.A. Hot pink in the summertime: That’s the new Barbie. And, whoopsie, she’s having an existential crisis. When the Mattel doll (a perfectly cast Margot Robbie) leaves her platonic pal Ken (hunky Ryan Gosling) for the real world, she gets a big surprise. Unlike her native Barbieland, a girl-power utopia where plastic playthings are presidents and Supreme Court justices, she confronts the patriarchy. Over at Mattel, the CEO (Will Ferrell, 56) presides over an all-male board that won’t play nice and wants to put her in a box. Throughout, the tone is playfully ironic with a side of preach. The biggest joy is in the endless runway of familiar doll costumes and the cotton candy sets. Robbie makes a genial ringmaster, with a terrific cast that includes Rhea Perlman, 75, America Ferrera and a slew of starry Barbies and Kens. Is Barbie a feminist? The movie replies with a chorus of “yes!” —T.M.A. Tim Appelo covers entertainment and is the film and TV critic for AARP. Previously, he was the entertainment editor at Amazon, video critic at Entertainment Weekly, and a critic and writer for The Hollywood Reporter, People, MTV, The Village Voice and LA Weekly."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE," It's strange to sit here wondering if I've hit Marvel fatigue. The comic-book movie company has been in a weird spot since the epic conclusion of ""Avengers: Endgame,"" trying to find its footing again. And if Kevin Feige thought ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" would right the ship with the launch of Phase Five ... I have bad news for the architect of Marvel Studios' success. At the time of writing this, the third Ant-Man entry has a score somewhere in the low 50s on Rotten Tomatoes. It's only the second Marvel Cinematic Universe film to wind up there after ""Eternals,"" which I enjoyed more than the latest adventure of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd). The movie starts off with a clip of what Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) was up to between the first two movies trapped in a place called the Quantum Realm. And then we launch into a happy narration from Scott living his best life in San Francisco. In his mind, Ant-Man fought hard and saved the world, so now he can enjoy life: celebrate his marriage, write a memoir, be a dad, you know, normal stuff. Unfortunately for Scott, more Marvel movies mean more villains to face. When Scott's entire family gets sucked into the Quantum Realm, he'll come face-to-face with a powerful foe named Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). Before they can return home, Scott, Janet, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) will have to find a way to deal with Kang. You could ask me all throughout Phases Two and Three who my favorite Avenger was, and I'd always say ""Ant-Man."" I loved Rudd's charming take on a dad who made some mistakes in life and is trying to do right by his daughter. ""Ant-Man"" and ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" felt like fun, self-contained adventures. I respected them for their size and scope in relation to the Avengers films that sandwiched each. It was nice to have smaller movies that didn't revolve around saving the world, ya know? Scott's problems seemed more relatable. How do you make a divorced family relationship work while trying to raise a kid and deal with a criminal history? What do you do when you lose a job? I loved all of it. Director Peyton Reed was responsible for providing a pair of films that put more emphasis on humor than action, and I was perfectly happy with that. So now I have Reed to thank for the mixed bag this latest entry turned out to be. I remember reading in Entertainment Weekly that the director was tired of Ant-Man's movies being ""palate cleansers."" He wanted the newest film to be ""epic."" But here's the thing. I was over the moon to have these ""palate cleansers."" I adored everything from Scott's relationship with his little girl to Luis' (Michael Pena) flashbacks. Let the demigod with the hammer, or the supersoldier deal with ""epic."" I liked my Ant-Man to have more fun-size adventures. His movies were places to catch our breath. ""Quantumania"" tries to make Ant-Man into an epic hero who has to stop a rogue, time-traveling exterminator of realities. And it contains all the cliches Marvel's been unable to shake over the last couple of phases. I'm talking about cliches like faceless CGI armies and battles between people with amazing superpowers devolving into fistfights. The Quantum Realm has truly become nothing more than whatever Marvel needs it to be for the plot. It has gone from a place you go when you shrink too small to a place where you time travel. Now it's a MacBook screensaver that fills 95% of the film, and its design seems entirely random instead of intentional. You can have movies set entirely in CGI that still look as though the characters are actually in their environments. James Cameron proved that twice with ""Avatar,"" and within the MCU, James Gunn proved it with ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" But in this latest Ant-Man film, I was left feeling as though the Quantum Realm and those within it were nothing more than oozes and psychedelic colors. Seeing it in IMAX was an assault on the senses. On top of that, the new characters introduced aren't developed in the least. I had no emotional investment in any of the people struggling under Kang's rule because we weren't shown what daily life was like for them. It became a classic case of telling instead of showing. Bill Murray and William Jackson Harper (""The Good Place"") both show up and get a couple of laughs but ultimately have no impact on the story. It's a shame ""Quantumania"" turned out to be such a hollow movie because Majors is a terrific actor. I just wish Marvel would give him an intelligent script to match his raw talent. Both here and in ""Loki,"" he was done a disservice by the writing. The lackluster writing and typical Marvel cliches don't allow for Rudd's effortless charm to carry the character. But hey, there's a pretty cool after-credits scene once all the text stops scrolling. So... silver lining I guess? After this, I'm left asking myself if I'm finally starting to get tired of superheroes. Then again, after the trailer for ""The Flash,"" maybe I'm just tired of Marvel's superheroes, at least until they finally give me Johnny Blaze in the MCU. DC, meanwhile, looks like it might finally be in an interesting spot.

"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Thoroughly enjoyed Ant Man And The Wasp&#58; Quantumania&#46; Jonathan Majors is a superstar with Michelle Pfeiffer matching him beat for beat&#46; The world building of the Quantum Realm is stunning&#46; It has the right mix of humor&#44; emotional stakes&#44; action&#44; and awe&#46; 
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE," Después de hacer una contribución crucial para salvar el mundo, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) ha encontrado paz en su vida, al menos tan tranquila como puede ser la vida de un ex superhéroe en una gira de lectura con su autobiografía. Poco sabe él que su próxima aventura no está muy lejos. Su hija Cassie (Kathryn Newton) ha estado trabajando en un dispositivo que permite la comunicación con el nivel cuántico. Cuando Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), quien estuvo atrapada allí durante 30 años, se entera de esto, insta a que el dispositivo se apague de inmediato. Pero demasiado tarde: los tres, junto con el marido de Janet, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) y su hija Hope (Evangeline Lilly) son atraídos hacia el mundo diminuto. El misterioso Kang (Jonathan Majors) la espera allí, con añoranza , y todavía tiene una vieja cuenta que saldar con Janet. En medio del extenso universo cinematográfico de Marvel, las historias sobre Scott Lang, que puede transformarse en pequeño o gigante con la ayuda de un traje especial, siempre fueron un poco más sencillas. A diferencia de sus colegas, que siempre tenían que salvar al mundo entero, él estaba más preocupado por sí mismo y su familia. Entonces podrías percibir eso como agradable y comprensivo, o de alguna manera irrelevante. Además, los resultados de la muestra de Ant-Man (2015) y Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) fueron mucho más pequeños que los espectáculos de los demás. El personaje del título juega un papel de forma indirecta. Así, se convirtió en un personaje clave en la lucha contra Thanos en Avengers: Endgame. Y también la tercera película en solitario,.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, es importante ya que presenta al antagonista Kang, de quien se rumorea que será el próximo gran antagonista del UCM. Pero pasa bastante tiempo antes de que la película llegue al personaje y dé una idea de lo que la hace tan peligrosa. Hay muchas pistas, especialmente de Janet. Pero eso sigue el principio: simplemente no digas demasiado. Como si, al estilo Harry Potter, la mera mención de su nombre provocara el fin del mundo. El tiempo de espera es en Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania bien puenteado al permitirnos llegar a conocer el nivel cuántico ampliamente. Aunque es muy pequeño, tiene mucho que ofrecer. El equipo pudo realmente desahogarse a la hora de diseñar las criaturas. Todo lo que pasa está permitido. Y mucho de lo que en realidad no es posible. Esto es extremadamente pesado en CGI cuando prácticamente toda la película se filmó frente a pantallas verdes. Pero todavía hay mucho que ver. Los extraños seres que pueblan el mundo en miniatura son maravillosamente caprichosos y extravagantes. Desde la poco valorada Valerian - La Ciudad de los Mil Planetas  no ha sido tan divertido estar en un mundo tan colorido y extraño. Pero eso es sólo una parte de la historia. Si bien la primera mitad recuerda mucho a la competencia interna de ciencia ficción Guardians of the Galaxy, se supone que se volverá realmente oscura y trágica más adelante. Algo de eso funciona, también por el elenco: Michelle Pfeiffer puede no estar tan agotada como en Batman Returns, pero tiene momentos fuertes como una ex heroína con un pasado misterioso. Y Jonathan Majors también complace con sus interpretaciones de Kang, que se caracterizan por una intensidad amenazante, incluso si el guión sigue siendo un poco vago. Aquí es donde Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania se beneficia una vez más, la serie, que atrae regularmente a los pesos pesados ​​​​del teatro y, por lo tanto, le da peso y sustancia incluso a los personajes apenas dibujados, desde el poder de tracción. Pero este talento no puede ocultar el hecho de que la película se vuelve cada vez menos interesante a medida que avanza. No es ningún secreto que Marvel se resiste a participar en experimentos narrativos, rara vez se desvía de la fórmula. Ni te atrevas a probar aquí, en la segunda mitad Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumaniatan son tan poco imaginativos e intercambiables que puedes salir del cine y aún haber visto la historia. Aquí falta la creatividad que mostró el equipo con el mundo y las criaturas, lo que genera una ruptura bastante severa entre las dos mitades y por supuesto, esto también funciona en la enésima variante. Si algo demuestra la película es lo adaptables que son algunos conceptos: ¿quién hubiera pensado que la caballería también podría ser hormigas? Sin embargo, persiste la sensación que ya acompañó a la fase 4 del MCU: a pesar de los muchos personajes, la película en realidad no tiene nada más que contar.

"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE," Establishing a defining global franchise must be every big studio’s dream. The standard has been set by the Marvel Cinematic Universe for over a decade now and that comes with its own particular curse. Since releasing a string of record-breaking titles, the MCU has been attempting to recycle its formula the way a chef delivers on a famous recipe. With movies that can be perilous. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is the latest sign of Marvel struggling to juggle all of its standard elements. It is the newest entry in one of the franchise’s smaller delights, where the comedy worked even better than the world-saving plot. Returning director Peyton Reed is tasked with tapping into the title’s natural charm while simultaneously setting us up further for the next, gargantuan “Avengers”-style showdown. In the end one threatens to cancel out the other. We’re still in the lingering aftermath of the events from “Avengers: Endgame” and Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has become a bit of a local celebrity. Sure he gets confused sometimes by the local coffee shop owner for Spider-Man, but he still basks in being seen as part of the Avengers, who saved us all from Thanos. He’s even written a book and does public readings. At home Scott lives with girlfriend Hope aka the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), who now runs the company founded by genius dad Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Hank’s wife, Hope’s mother, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) is back home as well but still processing her 30 years living trapped in the quantum realm. Meanwhile Scott’s daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), is an adolescent constantly getting into trouble with the police for her activities as a radical activist decrying gentrification. When Cassie develops a device that can send a signal into the Quantum Realm, Janet freaks out and they’re all sucked into the microscopic plain. Not only will the group discover shocker secrets about Janet’s time here, they will face a new menace in galactic warlord Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who seeks to, well, conquer many worlds.  The delight of the first two “Ant-Man” movies was in how they carried the same misfit, breezy spirit of fellow MCU entries such as “Guardians of the Galaxy.” Comedy was skillfully combined with stylish, trippy visuals that felt like “2001: A Space Odyssey” meets “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.” There wasn’t too much narrative baggage and Scott made for a likable screw-up. “Quantumania” aims for a larger scale that also feels curiously hollow. Visually it’s still quite trippy with the Quantum Realm designed like a whole other galaxy inhabited by creatures ranging from vegetable heads to a walking blob of gelatin, who is endlessly fascinated by how humans have multiple holes. On an IMAX screen viewers will feel as if they’ve been transported into a petri dish. Ships and buildings are alive, so to fly you need to stick your hands into gooey extensions. Alas, many backgrounds look like your standard Marvel CGI canvases designed by graphic illustration graduates.  While wandering the quantum realm, our heroes also get dressed in new threads that look suspiciously like an attempt at referencing “Star Wars.” In fact, much of the plot is a virtual rehash combo of that galaxy far, far away and the Thanos storyline.  “Quantumania” is not a “bad” Marvel movie and doesn’t feel as half-formed as last year’s “Thor: Love and Thunder.” It is good moments overwhelmed by a bloated structure. When it sticks to its original “Ant-Man” identity it can still be very funny. It turns out Janet was part of a resistance underground fighting against Kang, prompting Hank to realize she’s keeping secrets. There is a scene with real hilarity involving a former resistance leader, Lord Krylar (Bill Murray), who openly boasts about having been Janet’s lover. Murray is the latest example of Marvel showing off how it can bring in anyone into its universe, yet it really is more of a glorified cameo that leads to nothing other than a good chuckle. William Jackson Harper is thankfully used more often as Quaz, a Quantum inhabitant who can read minds and hates it because “everyone is disgusting.” But unlike “Guardians of the Galaxy,” not enough space is given to build a real sense of camaraderie because the screenplay rushes into attempting to wet our appetite for what is clearly some big, multi-verse epic MCU guru Kevin Feige is feverishly cooking up. For the task of bringing in that new cosmic conflict, Feige has settled on Kang the Conqueror. Great talents can make recycled personas engaging, which is what Jonathan Majors does with Kang. Marvel is littered with these egomaniacs wanting to burn worlds but Majors brings real pathos to this villain, channeling a real sense of profound anger and pain. He never goes for a booming, cartoonish villain voice but the measured, self-assured tone of a confident, charismatic maniac. With a lesser actor the role would seem like a boring retread. However, a far more entertaining villain is M.O.D.O.K. (Corey Stoll), essentially an armed floating head with small, armored legs and arms made out of Darren Cross, the corporate villain from the first “Ant-Man.” Stoll gets overall better one-liners and revives the comedic spirit of the first movies. Like “Deadpool,” the unsavory is made pitiful and funny through this kind of villain. And, kudos to writer Jeff Loveness for sneaking in a wink at Marx, a big admirer of ants, when Hank gets into a tangent about ants displaying socialist values.  “Quantumania” is a shorter Marvel entry at only 2 hours and 5 minutes, rushing to its conclusion with the same formula we’ve seen countless times now. Everyone eventually rises up against Kang, a massive CGI battle ensues with plenty of running, flying and exploding. Ant-Man becomes gigantic and smashes many structures and oh look, Cassie also has an ant suit and can indeed also grow to a massive scale. Technically it’s impressive but the payoff is left lacking. The story is left feeling incomplete because we’ve sat through yet another set-up. Flickers remain of the mischievous fun of the first two movies, which in this one feel like relief from the wall-to-wall digital distractions. Rudd also keeps Scott as a gentler misfit just trying to be a good dad. “Ant-Man” has the appeal of a parable about a vastly imperfect dad dealing with his own immaturity. Being a superhero is what forces him to truly grow up. More of that would have made this a worthy sequel. “Quantumania” still delivers spectacle but loses sight of how it’s the little things that count."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL," The Marvel Cinematic Universe has made it its mission to mainstream comics into popular culture by adapting their printed material into live-action content, hoping to watch the comic book movie genre flourish as its grip on filmgoing tightened. Marvel movie premieres become an increasingly popular event as the fandom swelled tremendously. Its omnipotence over media becomes divisive as the studio continued to climb upwards  - and eventually, hits its peak. The studio brought some of the comics'  storylines to life while attempting to tap into a devoted audience eagerly awaiting the next slate of movies, later spiraling into an even more elaborate timeline as they viewed television as an alternative vehicle to drive up viewership. While titular heroes such as Iron Man and Captain America earned their respected followings, some (literally) smaller heroes set out to impact the MCU in a big way. Ant-Man crawled into theaters in 2015, and since then, has played a larger role in the greater scope of a tiringly endless sea of Marvel titles.  It's upon the third entry of the Ant-Man saga that really asks the question: is Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania really about Ant-Man anymore? Marvel Studios has become far too comfortable with making its cinematic entries crossover events that have lost touch with their purpose over time. The success of the Avengers series has reassured that these grandiose multi-level stories are profitable, but are they narratively necessary? The first two Ant-Man movies were focused and concentrated on its key players, all while not taking themselves too seriously. They were praised for their genuine sense of fun and doubled as easy, effortless watching that required little research, making it accessible to more casual audiences interested in dipping their toe into Marvel's vast collection of entertainment. While Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania intros itself with enough context (in classic Ant-Man style), the pacing to hurry along feels rushed. Ill-timed pacing gives no time for scenes to sink in. Though Marvel claims they're set on pursuing a new phase with new adversaries, there's still the refusal to move on from Josh Brolin's Thanos and the infamous ""blip."" The heavy reliance on reminding audiences of the past takes away from the future.  There's no clear direction in tone or plot, and the finalized screenplay feels light or thin in comparison to the thematic landscape of what Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania sets out to achieve. Ant-Man 3 really wants to retain its brand of humor but sometimes finds itself swapping silliness for spite. It takes a while for the movie to hit that stylized sense of comedy that gave the first two Ant-Man movies a sense of personality. There's a bit of an identity crisis at play as it departs further from being an Ant-Man and Wasp adventure, sprawling into a Pym-Lang family affair.  A few quick-witted one-liners find their way back to signature quips, but amid the mania of the Quantum Realm (which is vaguely explained and left up to audience interpretation as to what it really is), the fun is lost. It's easy to forget that this is an Ant-Man movie and not another massive collaboration across Marvel's many channels. Its success is in its most intimate subplot: Scott ""Ant-Man"" Lang (Paul Rudd) reconnecting with estranged daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). Their on-screen relationship matures through strengthening bonds, and while it's a heartfelt angle, is sometimes overshadowed by overarching storylines distracting from their refreshed relationship. There's little to Cassie besides breathlessly calling out for her father and Newton acting her way through her Ardell Lash Wispies - especially when there should be more in store for her future.  It shouldn't be a chore for billion-dollar studios to perfect their CGI formula. For a movie so reliant on green screen technology to bring psychedelic worlds to life, the final editing is mostly disappointingly poor. The inconsistency of graphics varying from scene to scene is greatly distracting, and any rendering used to replicate human figures is unsettlingly uncanny. In an age where tech reigns supreme, Marvel Studios shouldn't be struggling to nail its approach to how digitalization fares on screen. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's experiential strangeness feels far too removed from the Marvel Cinematic Universe's future plans. It's certainly the most distant title to step back from the Ant-Man series. Those who dwell in the Quantum Realm look and feel as if they've stepped out of Star Wars, Dune, or Mad Max as popular science fiction influence contributes to unique characters (and character designs). The need to bloat the B-Level heroes into something bigger than themselves takes away from what makes them significant, and it feels as if Ant-Man is sidelined for the sake of an ensemble cast to work in tandem. Michelle Pfeiffer's Jane Van Dyne steps up significantly as a priority character, but it's Jonathan Majors who steals the show. Majors is truly fantastic as Kang the Conquerer and effortlessly delivered the best MCU villain to date. Brutal, intense, and cruel, Majors' Kang is simply the most intimidating foe deserving of fear to enter Marvel's live-action catalog. It's made incredibly clear that Marvel insisted on a more serious approach for the threequel; Kang's sheer presence is enough to shift the tone significantly. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been in need of a villain that demands respect and sincerely evokes dread of what's to come next. Majors carries Kang's cold, manipulative, and ruthless persona with ease.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quatumania is designed with diehard fans in mind who are dedicated to pledging their allegiance to the studio - even when the quality may not be there. There are moments that can be praised about the sequel, though by the end credits' grand reveal, it proves itself to be more of a stepping stone than an Ant-Man movie. While an ant can lift  5,000 times its own body weight, there's little to support here. 5/10. "

"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE," If you tried to turn the first reel of this film into a drinking game involving every utterance of the word “Quantum,” there would be no survivors. I stopped counting after 20 in the first 15 minutes, and it doesn’t really go away. It’s like “fuck” in a Joe Begos film, or “Kirsty” in Hellbound: Hellraiser II — a word said so many times it loses all meaning and then sends you into a linguistic deathloop where you’re trying to figure out why these sounds represent anything. Wittgenstein would be proud, to be sure. The gang from the previous Ant-Man adventures is back, journeying through the Quantum Realm (think a subatomic freakout land composed of bits of every ’80s dark fantasy/sci-fi crossover) to try and get out of it while also avoiding the many, many, many secrets from Janet Van Dyne’s 30 years spent in this realm before we ever really met her on screen. It’s not a movie-killing retcon like Back to the Future II, or the character assassinations of Wanda Maximoff and David Marcus in Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness or Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, respectively, but it generates a lot of the wrong kind of suspense for a movie that is basically treading water for a collective narrative weight its previous installments were refreshingly free from.  The thing about everything that gets shot on The Volume — or whatever they’re calling the surround LCD-wall system wherein actors can actually see whatever CG vistas are going to be surrounding them (see The Mandalorian and such) — is that it’s great for actors so they can have some sense of perspective. The problem is, it’s still a screen that occupies a different plane of existence from whichever performers and props are being photographed in front of and amidst it. This means a pronounced lack of depth. Which is actually a reason why I’ve no doubt that the 3D conversion of Quantumania is a more visually satisfying experience. Though this isn’t how the film was screened for the press, it demands to be seen that way. This is Marvel in full-on Juicy J “Trippy Mane”/Maxfield Parrish mode, with all manner of creatures, realms and squiggly electrified particles all in flux in most every shot, and all the kinky and diaphanous edges are what’s the most fun.  It’s weird how, for an Ant-Man and the Wasp film, the titular twosome at times seem like guest stars. The first hour tends to keep focus on Michelle Pfeiffer’s Janet Van Dyne character, which is in no way a mistake. The writing is shaky, and the whole thing seems to exist to retcon Loki villain Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors, taking some chicken-shit dialogue and treating it like it’s chicken salad) as part of the Van Dyne/Pym/Lang section of current Marveltry to set up future Big Bad rumblings. It also sidelines Evangeline Lilly’s Wasp for big heaps of the film, which could be knee-jerk sexism but could just as easily be the Corporate Powers That Be dealing with Lilly’s anti-vaxxer social profile.  But in addition to Pfeiffer, and the reliable and soothing perpetuality of Paul Rudd, this movie has two superb creatures. One, a swooping crab-manta thing that actually had me saying out loud, “I love that monster.” The other, genre cinema treasure David Dastmalchian voicing a superintelligent bipedal liquid who conveys the gift of universal communication when all the creatures drink some of them. I’m sure the latter triggers someone’s hypersensitivity to the point of helplessness as a signifier for queerness, or the existence of a creature which refutes the legend of Babel being some threat to shaky Sunday school memories, but for regular people, this creature steals the whole movie. This film is silly and messy and pretty and trippy, and though it fulfills the obligations of vweepy laser fights, digital everything, and several different varieties of product placement (including one genuinely funny appearance in the midst of an unexpected riff on Clive Barker’s The Hills, the Cities), it’s not going to reshape the marketplace the way some previous Marvel films have. To be sure, there are little touches for longtime heads (there’s a D’Bari in this film, with lines and everything), and I had fun with the experience. I’ve already got tickets for a 4DX show just because of how bad I want to see it in 3D (and also because I need some evil shaken out of my lower back and spine). But it feels like it’s going to be another couple TV series and at least one more feature before the MCU regains that expansive focus that made its first 20-some-odd films such a phenomenon."

"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE," During the previous Christmas, my family decided to adopt a new tradition. Instead of eating turkey, which we can’t abide, or singing Christmas carols in subzero temperatures, which is a good way to joyously get hypothermia, we decided to give each other books on Christmas Eve. This concept hails from one of those Scandinavian-ish countries, and everybody is meant to give/receive a book, settle down with a drink, and peacefully enjoy the evening.* The tome I received was “All of the Marvels,” by Douglas Wolk. It’s an excellent book in which Wolk recounts his experience reading every single comic published by Marvel Comics. So what did he learn? First, he strenuously recommends that nobody should ever read every single comic published by Marvel Comics. As a casual comics reader, I agree with that statement. While there are some honest-to-Galactus classics, you have to wade through a lot of crap to get to them. The second lesson is to embrace confusion. Wolk notes that if you pick up a random issue of Avengers, there’s likely to be a degree of, “Wait…who are these people? What are they talking about? What in the hell is going on?” That’s to be expected, considering that the longest fictional narrative in human history is found in the pages of Marvel Comics. It’s been going since the early 1960s, and there comes a point where readers have to just roll with it. I think it’s fair to say that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is reaching a similar stage. That’s not exactly a scorching hot take, since it’s a franchise that encompasses TV series, specials, short films, and viral marketing pieces. Oh, and a metric ass-ton of movies. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania marks the 31st film in the MCU and the official beginning of Phase 5. Does any of that mean anything? Not really. Is it good? For the most part, as long as you can roll with the confusion. After the events of The Blip and the defeat of the Mad Titan Thanos, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has settled into low-key celebrity status. As the astonishing Ant-Man, he’s a beloved hero and fairly successful author. He’s got a healthy relationship with Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), also known as the Wasp. Scott’s mentor Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) mostly tolerates him, and Scott doesn’t have to scoop ice cream any longer. Life is good for him.  Mostly good, anyway. Scott’s teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has gotten arrested. Again. She has a habit of confrontational activism. She wants to change the world for the better, and she wishes her father would step up and do the same. What’s an Ant-Man to do in a situation like that? Things get more complicated when Cassie invents a device that can make contact with the Quantum Realm, a subatomic collection of universes small enough to escape our notice. That’s bad. Why? Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) spent thirty years trapped there before being rescued by Hank, Hope, and Scott. She’s not exactly eager to return, since she has an intimate understanding of the flora, fauna, inhabitants and a dark secret that she’d like to keep buried. Things get really complicated when Cassie’s doohickey sucks all of them into the Quantum Realm. That’s bad. Why? First of all, they’re separated and menaced by a wide variety of subatomic critters. Worse than that is the fact that they’re plunged into the middle of a civil war. On one side are a rag-tag group of freedom fighters. On the other side is a conqueror, Kang (Jonathan Majors), a man with the means to control the timestream nearly within his grasp. Remember earlier when I mentioned The Blip and Thanos? It’s possible that you have no idea what I was referencing. The bad news is, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has zero interest in getting you up to speed. It isn’t interested in reminding you how these people know each other, and it doesn’t give a tinker’s damn if you know what an Avenger is. That’s why the Good Lord invented Wikipedia. Nearly immediately, director Peyton Reed stomps on the gas, plunging our itsy-bitsy heroes into chases, fistfights, battle sequences and other assorted setpieces. Reed’s previous MCU entries, Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp, were considered to be light palate cleansers between meatier films like Black Panther. He clearly wanted to flex his blockbuster muscle and show he can compete. The problem is, he’s made a film with a hell of a lot of setpieces and action and not a lot of character moments. I support artists making the kind of art they want to make. When it comes to the action, Reed does creditable work. He’s so good at showing his characters as people stuck in wild situations and portraying the relationships they have, and I wished there was more of that here. Reed is also hindered by the wildly overstuffed script by Jeff Loveness. I wouldn’t say his script is terrible, and he does good work with brief characterization amid the set pieces and a zingy sense of humor. The problem is that along with all of that, we also have flashbacks to Janet’s time in the Quantum Realm, flashbacks explaining what Kang’s deal is, the reveal of the big-headed villain M.O.D.O.K., and setups for future installments of the MCU. While I’m okay with a degree of that, there’s so much going on here that the narrative frequently screeches to a halt. Watch virtually any MCU film and you’ll notice that the actors generally put forth their best efforts. That continues to be the case with Quantumania. As Scott, Paul Rudd continues to be a fun and laid-back hero, until his daughter’s life is in danger. That’s when he gets intimidating…or as intimidating as Rudd is able to get. As amusing as it is to see him threaten the hulking Jonathan Majors, I believed that he believed it, and that gives the normally mellow Rudd an interesting edge. Michelle Pfeiffer is our other protagonist, and she acquits herself nicely as a woman holding a plethora of secrets. No big surprise that Pfeiffer can sell the physicality of the role while making Janet a layered character. Neither Michael Douglas nor Evangeline Lilly have much to do this time around, and as I mentioned earlier, it’s a real shame that Lilly doesn’t have more to sink her teeth into. You’ll also notice that there’s usually one standout performer. Here, it’s Jonathan Majors as Kang. He plays the Conqueror as a man of formidable focus, so much so that it feels a little out of place to have this level of intensity in an Ant-Man movie. I liked that as it makes Kang feel dangerous, like a legitimate threat. There are plans for Majors to be the next big bad in the MCU. If used right, he could be an all-timer. Somewhere in this great land of ours, some poor schmuck is going to buy a ticket to Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania without having seen the previous 30 films in the MCU. There’s a possibility they’ll be baffled, enraged even by the spectacle. My fingers and toes remain crossed that they’ll make themselves comfortable for a fun and uneven film, and that when things get confusing, they’ll embrace it. **I hear you saying, “But then Scott would be sidelined in his own movie!” Not necessarily. Hope supported the story of Scott connecting with his daughter in the first two films, and it would become a clever inverse of the original to have more of a focus on Hope and Janet."

This is the worst Marvel film overall I saw since Eternals and to be frank this movie was even worse on some levels.
Yeah I rank Antman 3 in my bottom third of Marvel films with Homecoming and
Antman 2.
However I disagree with the author on Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 3, that was good. Sean…you and I are in agreement for sure on Ant Man 3.

"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE," When you see Paul Rudd gliding down the street like the opening of an 80’s sitcom, you’re think this is gonna be hilarious, adventurous fun.  What you are not ready for is the real badass presence of Jonathan Majors (Kang) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Janet) going toe to toe and keeping audiences on their toes and salivating for more. Kicking off Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the fast-paced, big-screen adventure features all of the heart and humor fans of the MCU expect. “The ‘Ant-Man’ movies have always been about family,” says director Peyton Reed. “In ‘Quantumania,’ we’re deepening and complicating the family dynamic while painting on a much larger canvas. We dipped our toe in the Quantum Realm in the first couple of movies, and this time, we wanted to give the movie an entirely different look: It’s an epic experience.” Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania marks the third film in the Marvel franchise led by Super Heroes Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd)and Hope Van Dyne/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly). “One of the most fun things about ‘Quantumania’ is that the first two ‘Ant-Man’ [movies] are basically Earthbound—San Francisco,” says director Peyton Reed. “They’re really fun and you get to juxtapose the shrinking and growing to what we know around us. But what happens if we take these characters we’re familiar with and throw them into this environment that’s completely alien to them? What happens is a psychedelic, cinematic mind trip of mulitverse magic touting some riveting performances from Pfeiffer and Majors with a few intense fight sequences along the way. As much as it pains me to say this Paul, Engeline, Michael, Kathyrn Newton (Cassie), William Jackson Harper (Quaz) and Katy M. O’Brian (Jentorra) literally get upstaged by Kang and Janet.  To the point where you walk away from this chapter going I just need more scenes and sequences with them.  Needless to say it IS a Marvel movie, so just know you get another sequel in the franchise probably sooner than later."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantumania maintains the quirky fun of the Ant-Man movies and is a great introduction to Kang but it struggles with massively combating tones&#46; It&apos;s solid entertainment but the MCU bag of tricks have become redundant and exhausting&#46;
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL," “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is directed by Peyton Reed and stars Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Jonathan Majors, Kathryn Newton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas and William Jackson Harper. The third entry to this Ant-Man trilogy follows Scott Lang (Rudd), his daughter Cassie (Newton), Hope (Lilly), Janet (Pfeiffer) and Hank (Douglas) as they try to figure their way out of the Quantum Realm after being sucked in as a result of an experiment gone wrong. But they’re challenged after learning Kang (Majors) is residing in the realm and has conquered all its inhabitants, waiting for the perfect opportunity to get out of the realm. Phase Five of the MCU is upon us, and this introductory film is a disappointment. This universe has been deteriorating, maybe they’re still under the blip effect or perhaps they could have benefited from a break. This film lacks character development, cohesion and focus. The “jokes” don’t land, and the dialogue is eyeroll inducing. The writing does a huge disservice to thesecharacters. For most of the film, I was rooting for the villain and I did not care if any of the heroes died. For once, I’m confident this film could have benefited from an additional 20 or 30 minutes. It needed room to breathe and for me to sit with the attempted emotional and moving moments. Yes, I understand that we’ve been with these characters for years but that doesn’t instantly mean that we automatically care for their outcome. We’re introduced to older Cassie being released from jail, and that within itself had some potential storyline, but we’re quickly told that she was arrested for participating in a protest. In addition, she has magically mastered powerful equipment and even a suit. Scott and Hope are just there. Scott has written a book and is dealing with the aftermath of everything that occurred during the blip. For someone whose name is on the title of this film, Hope has taken a passenger seat in this movie. In fact, Pfeiffer’s Janet takes more of a center stage role. However, its effect is minimized because of how her character is presented. This script did nothing for them and I couldn’t become invested. There are various portions of the film that felt as if they were part of an entirely different movie or that important scenes or sequences were left out or replaced. It’s tonally inconsistent. I convinced myself to stay away from analyzing superhero films with logic because that’s a bit counterproductive and hypocritical, but some of these plot holes are outlandish and just makes this whole story sillier. The world building can be overwhelming at times and the visuals can be a bit too much. Not once did I feel a sense of awe or wonder (and neither did the characters). Some of the creatures were cool, but for the most part, it all felt too generic and familiar. Yes, there’s a little Star Wars universe within the Quantum Realm, but it feels like it’s due to a lack of creativity rather than paying homage to the franchise. That third act felt messy and anticlimactic. This is where the greenscreen and poor visuals are most notable. It felt chaotic and unfocused visually and narratively. Lastly, I have to mention that not seeing the greatest Latino character in the MCU, Luis (played brilliantly by the amazing Michael Peña), was a massive bummer. His comedic chops are what made the Ant-Man franchise stand out and differentiated from the rest of the MCU. Now this film fits right in with the rest of the MCU with nothing unique or special (other than Kang) to distinguish it. Majors is a menacing presence and by far the only salvageable element of this film. His agility to deliver silly lines and make them feel Shakespearean is impressive and a big testament to his talent. The film becomes interesting when he enters the frame, and he effortlessly overshadows every actor he shares the screen solely with his mere presence. If we need another piece of evidence that Majors is in fact on his way to being one of the most important and versatile actors of our generation, simply pay attention to how your eyes are glued to him in this film. He’s magnetic and commands attention with his sole presence. His performance made this film slightly watchable. Overall, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is a visual exposition filled with childish jokes and underwritten characters. Phase Five has me asking why I should root for the little guy when there’s a titan like Majors portraying Kang.

"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL," But there was something really charming and loose about its goofy, lower-stakes, self-contained vibe. The second film, Ant-Man and the Wasp from 2019, didn’t even have a villain, just a couple of antagonists. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania takes a wild departure from these smaller-scale capers and goes big, like really big. It makes Scott Lang’s Giant-Man persona look like Regular-Man. The third instalment in the Ant-Man movies, and the 31st overall MCU film, is a superhero epic of gargantuan proportions that overwhelms and overstimulates, but still manages to deliver some human emotions despite the CGI circus. After the events of Avengers: Endgame, Scott (Paul Rudd) has almost gone into superhero hibernation. He’s written his memoirs (a book you can actually buy in real life from September), he’s basking in the love that comes from saving the world, and he and Jimmy Woo (Randall Park) are gentlemen who lunch. But when his now-18-year-old daughter and budding activist Cassie (Kathryn Newton) shows him that she and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) have been trying to map the Quantum Realm by sending signals down, the device seemingly malfunctions and sucks them into it, along with Hope van Dyne (an underused Evangeline Lilly) and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer, spectacular as always). You might remember that the Quantum Realm is a secret universe that exists beneath ours. It was briefly shown in the first two Ant-Man movies, and Janet was trapped there for 30 years. What we didn’t previously see was the layers and worlds of the Quantum Realm, an alien-esque landscape that visually draws from other MCU titles such as Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok.  But it is most derivative of Star Wars, in more ways than one – if Disney didn’t own both Marvel and Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy might’ve considered suing. There’s a Big Bad lurking inside the Quantum Realm, and he’s the arch-villain of this tranche of MCU movies to be known as the Multiverse Saga.  He is genocidal, manipulative, to the point the other versions of him have exiled him to the Quantum Realm. He is to the Multiverse Saga what Thanos was to the Infinity Saga. Maybe the real battle in Quantumania is the one of the more straight comedy you want it to be, and which it wants to be, versus the imposing and lofty plot-moving story the wider MCU tapestry demands it be. The jokes, quips and gags ratio is still high, and there are genuinely fun moments including tete-a-tetes with a supporting Quantum Realm telepathic character played by William Jackson Harper, or the return and evolution of Corey Stoll’s Darren Cross into MODOK. There are plenty of other positives to be found, including the movie’s focus on the relationships between the characters, especially that of the father-and-daughter dynamic of Scott and Cassie. Rudd has always been a charismatic performer, the kind of actor you always want to root for, and he creates tangible onscreen bonds with his co-stars. Rudd’s charm isn’t bombastic or obviously blinding, but there is a magnetism to his presence that yanks you into his orbit. So, you want to see Scott pull through, and you want everyone around him to pull through because, while those characters all have their own arcs, they’re important to Scott. And Quantumania has the benefit of goodwill from Rudd’s eight years in the MCU to offset the grandiosity of the Quantum Realm. But there is no denying that the Ant-Man you knew is not the Ant-Man of Quantumania – and it’s not an upgrade. It is so bogged down in excessive CGI action sequences, its extravagance dissipates into a numbing nothingness.  Both a great sports movie and unconventionally riveting romantic drama, Challengers volleys the audience back and forth to reveal what is riding on a tennis match, writes Leigh Paatsch."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE," It’s fair to say that the third Ant-Man movie is the
most ambitious of the trio. It’s also unlike most superhero movies, taking the
storyline into uncanny and mostly unexplored (at least in the MCU) directions.
There are glimpses of potential greatness and teases of future storylines that
could become incredibly convoluted. Unfortunately, the film possesses a
screenplay that struggles to express its complex ideas in a coherent manner.
The ending is confusing and unearned and there’s a sense that the only way a
villain this powerful can be defeated (if only temporarily) is by violating the
film’s internal logic and employing a deus ex machina. Some of the same
problems that infected Avengers: Endgame are evident here. And, as
different as Quantumania strives to be, it all comes down to the
same-old same-old: a big CGI battle and a fist-fight.  As far as conveying complicated notions surrounding the
nature of time, quantum mechanics, and relativistic physics, Quantumania veers
into contradictory and often indecipherable territory. It’s not clear whether
the problem is that the filmmakers (director Peyton Reed and screenwriter Jeff
Loveness) don’t understand these things themselves or whether they’re unable to
convey their understanding to an audience. The harder one tries to truly grasp
the underlying principles being hinted at, the more frustrating the experience
becomes. Ultimately, Quantumania is best appreciated on a pure comic
book level – fights, special effects, etc.  Although Quantumania is ostensibly an Ant-Man
movie, it’s really an opportunity for Marvel to introduce the latest Big Bad
Guy to audiences, and he feels an awful lot like Thanos Mark II. We get bits
and pieces of his backstory – enough to establish him as a “conflicted” entity
rather than an inherently evil monster. A mid-credits sequence that’s designed
to illustrate the extent of his threat, feels more comedic than ominous, which
is certainly not the tone Reed was trying for. Although this isn’t the first
time Jonathan Majors has been introduced to Marvel viewers (he previously
played a variant of Kang in the TV series “Loki”), it represents his debut for
non-Disney+ subscribers. Majors’ approach to the role is interesting – calm and
brooding, albeit prone to volcanic outbursts. He delivers dialogue with
numerous dramatic pauses, making one wonder whether he spent time studying
William Shatner before embarking on this performance.  After a brief introduction set on Earth (with the amusing
conceit that Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang is often mistaken as a better-known
Avenger), Quantumania wastes little time plunging the insect family – Ant-Man,
Hope Van Dyne a.k.a. The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), Hank Pym (Michael Douglas),
Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Scott’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn
Newton) – into the Quantum Realm. Trapped there, they have to find their way
home without being discovered by Kang, who has built an empire during his
period of exile (30 years) in the micro-universe. Kang wants his freedom and
claims that unless he attains it, bad things will happen. He captures Scott and
Cassie and bargains with the daughter’s life for the father’s help in obtaining
the MacGuffin that will allow him to power up his ship. Meanwhile, alerted by a
monologue by Janet about Kang’s true nature, the Van Dynes band together to
stop him from getting what he wants. World-building in the Quantum Realm is disappointingly
scattershot but at least the place looks interesting – kind of a cross between
a low-rent Pandora and one of those bizarre milieus from sci-fi films of the
1950s and 1960s (Fantastic Voyage, for example). As eye candy goes, it’s
fun, although George Lucas did a better job with this sort of thing in The Phantom Menace. Speaking of Star Wars, there are various nods and
homages. Some of the creatures look like refugees from A New Hope’s
cantina. There’s a sequence that apparently references the cell block rescue
from the same movie and another that recalls some of the Ewok material from Return of the Jedi.  Despite their names being featured in the title, Ant-Man and
The Wasp often fade into the background, seeming more like supporting
characters than leads. The juicier roles belong to Hank, Janet, Cassie, and
Kang. Bill Murray enters the MCU with a character that might have been written
for him. Corey Stoll, who played the villainous Yellowjacket in Ant-Man,
comes back as the comedically vicious Mental Organism Designed Only for
Conquest (M.O.D.O.C.).  The overall narrative is pedestrian but offers enough
flashes, bangs, and general weirdness for those who prefer to sit back and
absorb such things. One problem with the latest round of Marvel movies – the
ones featuring multiverses and such – is that they are becoming increasingly
difficult to relate to. I recognize that many feature faithful adaptations of
comic book elements but there are things that can work in strips on a printed
page that don’t translate well into a live-action motion picture format.
(Director Tim Story was keenly aware of this when he made Rise of the Silver Surfer in 2007 vis à vis Galactus, although his “solution” was a disaster.)
Still, Quantumania is the best of the three Ant-Man movies,
outshining the previous installment by a good bit and even edging out the first
one. It can be amusing when appropriate and serious when necessary and
maintains a high level of energy to go along with its eccentricity. For all its
epic aspirations, however, it feels slight."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL," Ant-Man and the Wasp find themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that pushes them beyond the limits of what they thought was possible. It's a new dawn - or new phase - for the Marvel Cinema Universe, and we're kicking it off with our favourite little guys Ant-Man and The Wasp, as they unwillingly get sucked into the Quantum Realm. As the first film for MCU's Phase Five, it will set up the direction for this new era, its multiversal seeds already planted by Loki, Multiverse of Madness and a little bit by Ms Marvel. The Quantum Realm - a universe outside of time and space - had great potential as a zany jump board for the juggernaut franchise's new era, but by playing it too safe and infused with a severe lack of passion for the story, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantamania is the first real mud on the face for Marvel. Feeling much like a filler episode before we get to the 'real' movie, we find Scott Lang enjoying life post-Thanos, semi-retired from fighting and bailing his daughter out of jail. Hope is changing the world with her father's company and catching up with her mother.  When an experiment goes awry, the whole family is transported to the Quantum Realm, and they discover the old Wasp didn't tell them everything about what happened while she was marooned there. I had a lot of love for the first two Ant-Man films - lowkey and fun while oozing Paul Rudd's undeniable magnetism. Outside of the Avenger team-ups, it was a low-stakes romp that gave the franchise breathing room between the bigger superhero epics. Quantamania marketed itself as a step-up for Ant-Man's adventures, especially as the first Phase Five film, but unfortunately, it fell on its face with a loud and echoing thud. Similar to Multiverse of Madness, its setting offered a chance to push the envelope a bit, create weird and wonderful characters and lean into the craziness. But like the Dr Strange film, it wouldn't go far enough, constrained by the studio's fear of stepping outside of its self-made box. The saddest part was it had potential. Personally, I loved how the rebellion's spaceships were living beings, in stark contrast to the villain's lifeless citadel and the goo that helps the variety of Quantum beings understand each other. Instead of unravelling the life that permeates this complex universe, the writers sped over any sort of much-needed world-building that could have elevated the film beyond squeezing Rudd's puppy dog charm for all it's worth. We needed to care more about those that live in the Quantum Realm so that we care more about what happens to them. The sci-fi parts had an interesting mix between Guardians of the Galaxy and Star Wars, and you keep wanting to know more, but the movie refuses to engage with any curiosity. Even our main stars weren't afforded any real engagement with their emotions and relationships with each other. There was no real tension, no build-up to a big emotional catharsis that made any sacrifice or risk meaningful. Poor Evangeline Lilly barely had any chance to create a worthwhile connection with her on-screen mother, Michelle Pfeiffer, and including The Wasp in the title is almost deceptive. Kathryn Newton, on the other hand, went to the Paul Rudd School of Jokes as the replacement for his daughter. There was so much set-up for this cutesy relationship in the previous films, but it didn't quite stick the landing as much with an older Cassie. Newton had good moments, but her character's failings had more to do with the writing than her own skills. Kang shined, however, as Marvel's newest supervillain, played by Jonathan Majors. At times he felt too much like Thanos, but Majors infuses him with a certain menace that makes him a formidable opponent. His talent did feel a bit out of place with such a banal script, but he delivered enough of a terrifying performance to get you on the Kang bandwagon. He received more love than the actual superheroes from the studio, and for the audience, this was palpable. On the whole, Quantamania lacked heart because the actors didn't really have anything to work with, and it felt like Disney/Marvel didn't really care about the film at all. It's especially surprising since it has the same director as the first two Ant-Man films. You'd think there would be some passion for the title you've worked with for so long. Rather, they just needed a film to introduce their new villain and slapped 'good enough' on the final product, relying entirely on the MCU draw to pull at the box office. You're better off waiting for it to release on streaming."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE," With Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, the Marvel Cinematic Universe introduces a formidable new villain while grappling with some old issues that have plagued recent instalments of the 15-year-old superhero series. This sequel to 2018’s Ant-Man And The Wasp sends Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang and his cohorts into the Quantum Realm, where they battle the sinister Kang The Conqueror, brought to life compellingly by Jonathan Majors. Quantumania has greater stakes and a grander canvas than the more lighthearted previous chapters of the Ant-Man saga, and the film mostly negotiates the tricky tonal shift — even if the results are more predictable than spectacular.  Disney launches Quantumania in the UK and US on February 17. Ant-Man ($519 million worldwide) and Ant-Man And The Wasp ($623 million) were far from the MCU’s highest-grossing pictures, offering audiences a comic-relief palate cleanser in between epic Avengers adventures. Expect similar returns for Quantumania, in anticipation of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 hitting theatres in three months. Now a happy couple, Scott (Rudd) and Hope (Evangeline Lilly), a.k.a. Ant-Man and the Wasp, are adjusting to the fact that their cover is blown, making time for Hope’s scientist parents Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank (Michael Douglas) — not to mention Scott’s brilliant daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton). But when Cassie surprises the family by announcing that she has found a way to make contact with the Quantum Realm — where Janet had been marooned for decades — the five of them are accidentally sucked into that miniature world, which forces Janet to admit something she has been keeping secret ever since she returned in Ant-Man And The Wasp.  Directed by Peyton Reed, who oversaw the earlier Ant-Man instalments, Quantumania is built on some convoluted circumstances — chiefly, that Janet never told Hank and Hope what she was involved with in the Quantum Realm — but Scott quickly learns that there is a whole civilization residing there. Even more shocking, these beings live in fear of a horrifying foe named Kang (Majors), who controls time but has been imprisoned in the Quantum Realm to keep him from destroying the multiverse. This sequel takes a little while to find its stride, not just hampered by plotting issues but also a sense of familiarity. Not unlike Thanos, Kang (who first appeared in the Disney+ Loki series) is a seemingly all-powerful villain who wants to wreak havoc, which leads to de rigeur over-the-top fight sequences. Even some individual “hero” moments feel taken directly from previous MCU films, to say nothing of earlier blockbusters such as the original Star Wars trilogy.  That said, what has always been the saving grace of the Ant-Man series is its modest likability, which goes a long way towards making Quantumania feel relatively human-scaled despite its amped-up spectacle. The running joke in the MCU pictures is that, unlike mighty Avengers such as Thor or Iron Man, Scott is a regular guy with less-impressive powers, but it’s a compliment to this new film that Reed and his cast hold onto the character’s ordinariness while putting Scott into a situation where he’ll be tested in an unprecedented way.  Rudd helps enormously in this regard, exuding a genial normalcy while simultaneously shouldering Scott’s emotional arc. Unlike his activist daughter, Scott wants to stop being a do-gooder — as far as he’s concerned, defeating the monstrous Thanos was enough — but he’ll discover that evil doesn’t operate on a timetable, and that heroism is often needed at the most inopportune times.  Majors is the picture’s greatest asset, however, playing the slowly simmering Kang whose soft-spoken style belies the depth of his wickedness. Kang may not be an especially novel villain, but Majors’ magnetic, layered performance brings out the best in his co-stars — especially Rudd and Pfeiffer, whose characters are most impacted by Kang’s cruelty. Production designer Will Htay has envisioned a Quantum Realm full of trippy colours, although the quantum amounts of CGI can grow tiresome. Quantumania is strongest when it offsets the special effects with one-liners and amusing non sequiturs, although the jokes prove to be somewhat muted because of this film’s more serious scenario. Indeed, this is the least funny of the three Ant-Man pictures although, thankfully, the series’ low-key charm hasn’t been sacrificed in the name of establishing Kang as a striking nemesis. After 31 films, the MCU is clearly losing steam creatively if not commercially, but Majors’ villain should be tormenting the Avengers — and captivating superhero fans — for the foreseeable future.  Screen International is the essential resource for the international film industry.

"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL," For her directorial debut, Michelle Garza Cervera decided she wasn’t going to play it safe. Instead, she presents a chilling dissection of the tribulations of pregnancy following a woman settling into a domestic life having grown up fighting against that very idea. Having prayed to a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Valeria (Solián) and her husband Raúl (Dosal) receive the outcome they desire as their lives are about to be blessed with a newborn baby. However, the following months for Valeria are plagued by sneering family members, a loss of profession, a husband who fears sex in case it harms their baby, a desire for her old partner, and, oh, a malevolent entity that wishes to possess her. In short, she’s had better times. Huesera portrays a slow-burning, subtle horror that has an alarming intimacy, it's far more focused on Valeria’s struggles against a culture that expects her, as a woman, to submit to motherhood than with traditional horror - but there’s enough of that throughout also. She spends her pregnancy trying to live up to what others want when its apparent she isn’t clear on what she wants, and these moments provide plenty of discomfort alongside scenes of a menacing presence that lurks in the shadows and torments Valeria at every given opportunity (this entity is based on actual Mexican folklore). Cervera shows plenty of flair in her direction and the combined cinematography and sound design are especially impressive - at times, the sound literally crackles throughout as sequences of silence are shattered by the sickening crunch of bones. As Valeria spirals further physically and mentally, the movie veers more into conventional horror as the third act begins leading to a visually striking and satisfying conclusion, but, crucially, the movie isn’t upended or disjointed tonally by this shift. With a super lead performance from Natalie Solián (in her feature debut), sharp writing, and a combination of sequences that get under your skin, Huesera is a triumphant debut offering. The pace and overall lack of ‘scares’ may not be to everyone's tastes, and, at times, it does feel sluggish, but Huesera delivers a powerful, engaging, and sometimes bruising experience. The Australian film scene is one that consistently delivers strong productions that often fall below the radar, and their horror scene has, in the past, delivered some excellent entries into the genre. With Surrogate, debutant director David Willing opts to foray into the supernatural with a story focusing on Natalie (Morassi),  a single mother and nurse who, after aiding a sick woman late at night, falls mysteriously ill. This illness results in immediate symptoms of pregnancy that quickly culminates in an apparent birth, though the baby is nowhere to be found. With the ire of doctors and child services raised, and her physical and mental well-being on a rapid downward spiral, Natalie must do everything within in her power to keep her family and herself from falling apart. Whilst not wholly original - the film does lean heavily on its influences - Surrogate is an effective and sometimes excellent low-budget horror movie that blends supernatural elements with mystery and thriller aspects. Anchored by a strong lead performance from Kestie Morassi, there’s a confidence that flows through Surrogate which is a testament to Willing and co-writer Beth King, and its competent production blends well with Mark Buys’ score. At times, the movie can feel solid if unspectacular but sprinkled throughout are some genuinely excellent sequences - a seance midway through the movie is perfectly framed and executed to deliver a deliciously atmospheric and tense situation - and the conclusion was unexpectedly bleak and striking, its an ending that really props the movie up satisfyingly. With the varying subplots, characters, and genre crossovers, the movie does sometimes threaten to derail itself, and whilst not every aspect is a success, at no point do the wheels fall off entirely. Surrogate is an assured debut feature that attempts to blend the old and new, and, more often than not, succeeds in doing so. The time of Kang is now. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is both the 31st movie in the ever-lingering Marvel Cinematic Universe and the feature debut of Jonathan Major’s Kang the Conqueror - described as the next Thanos-level villain for our Avengers heroes. Peyton Reed returns to helm the third eusocial-themed blockbuster as Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang, along with his daughter Cassie (Newton), the Wasp (Lilly), Hank Pym (Douglas), and Janet van Dyne (Pfeiffer), explore the mysterious Quantum Realm, and, in doing so, threaten to unleash a force that could take over the universe. How they get there is a bit ridiculous, as is the rest of the movie sadly. Quantumania is a disjointed, messy, and, frankly bland movie that basically serves as a setup for the next batch of MCU movies at the expense of…being an Ant-Man movie. Quantumania starts off feeling like an Ant-Man flick and it’s as breezy and fun as you’d expect, but once the Quantum Realm is introduced, everything begins to fall apart narratively. The need to move things along to introduce Kang and his backstory, at the expense of the story, is plainly obvious alongside some tedious foreshadowing of “HIM”, “HE” and “SOMEONE” - Michelle Pfeiffer is asked to lazily spend half the movie not telling her family information which would be deemed as crucial to their plight. Thankfully, Jonathan Majors saves the movie with his strong and menacing performance as Kang, each scene he is in is elevated to the point that the rest of the movie seems vanilla by comparison. That’s not to say Paul Rudd isn’t his usual charming self, he is and he’s doing what he does best here, but the rest of the cast…aren’t great - I assumed throughout that Michael Douglas had quit acting whilst filming this. The cast has to work with what they are given so that should be taken into consideration, but their characters end up becoming lost in the sheer glob of colour and sometimes toe-curling VFX. I’m fully aware that the Quantum Realm needs to be realised somehow but, even for a multiverse setting, it felt too much here, especially with the StageCraft usage that stuck out badly. The art department was afforded licence to have fun with their designs though with an abundance of aliens and funky background characters, even if it did feel a bit Star Wars-y at times, and this element allowed for some ace character designs to distract from the visuals, shallow script, and uninspired gags - though MODOK was, well, awful. As someone who dug the first two Ant-Man movies, this feels like a step back for the character in service of the now standard-MCU setups which is a shame. We get Kang, which is great, but it’s hard not to wish that he could have been introduced in a better movie. After an encouraging start, Quantumania succumbs to mediocrity when it had the chance to propel the MCU forward effectively. Jonathan Majors is great, but the movie is anything but. Oh, and Bill Murray appears for some reason. Everyone’s favourite swashbuckling feline is back in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish…but for how long? You see, Puss (Banderas) has long neglected the value of his nine lives and is now down to his final one. After a brush with a villainous Wolf (Moura) causes him to retire to a cat home, Puss is quickly drawn back into the fight when the chance to wish his lives back into existence rears its head - but he’s not the only one trying to reach the mythical Last Wish. 2011’s Puss in Boots was well received as a spin-off to the Shrek franchise but a sequel after twelve years seemed like an odd choice, specifically, where has the interest come from to suddenly release a sequel now? Well, I’m glad that Dreamworks decided to push forward as Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is wonderful. A movie about a marauding cat delivering some genuinely poignant themes of friendship, selflessness, mental health, and mortality was not on my bingo card this year but here it is. The movie offers some deliciously realised animated action set pieces, good comedy, unsurprisingly strong voice acting from Banderas and Hayek (plus a slew of newcomers including Florence Pugh and Harvey Guillén’s cutesy Perrito) and one of the better villains I have seen in years - Wagner Moura’s Wolf had such a sinister presence that never let up, his menacing smile and whistle was a real sign that it was about to hit the fan. Similarly, the movie follows suit in that it doesn’t condescend to the audience in delivering its narrative and messages which is something that cannot be levied at other animated movies in recent years (also, at one point, a dude has his skin sucked right from his skeleton..). Crucially, whilst the story does sag somewhat at the midway point, there’s more than enough on offer throughout to keep audiences of all ages engaged and engrossed in the adventure. Emotional and surprisingly excellent, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one of Dreamworks' best and a real crowd-pleaser. When you see the surname ‘Cronenberg’ attached to anything, you should know that you’re in for a wild ride. The poster alone for Brandon Cronenberg’s latest effort Infinity Pool is odd enough, Alexander Skarsgård submerged in a red goo as Mia Goth looks on seductively/menacingly beside him - that would explain the ‘Pool’ of it all. The story centres on struggling author James Foster (Skarsgård) and his wife Em (Coleman), who, whilst, vacationing at a luxury resort on the reclusive island of Li Tolqa, meet Gabi (Goth) and Alban (Lespert). Whilst all initially seems pleasant, an incident outside of the resort (all guests are explicitly told not to leave the resort) involving both couples sends the Foster’s relationship into turmoil and James spiralling into an abyss of excess, depravity, and lust having witnessed…something…that initially repulsed him before becoming fully seduced by the idea. If you couldn’t tell, I am attempting to keep things as vague as possible so as not to drop spoilers for what is a fever dream packed with sex, orgies, urine, dark humour, and violence - it’s a lot. However, Infinity Pool feels focused narratively and in its direction - this feels like a step up from Cronenberg Jr’s previous movie Possessor - with its themes of depersonalization, hedonism, and the rich indulging their unkempt desires (money is the root of all evil, and all that). Skarsgård delivers a fine performance as he walks the lines between fear, anxiety, rage, lust, and acceptance and Goth provides yet another example of her exceptional talents (she again plays a scarily-genuine feeling psychopath), their interplay between them is fascinating to watch. The movie as a whole may not be fascinating for everyone to watch as it depicts graphic sexual scenes, drug usage, full frontal nudity, and blunt violence - it's not the heaviest movie I’ve ever seen but it may prove to be too challenging for some. Infinity Pool comes out of the gate fast with a strong first half before settling into a satisfyingly solid second half, though I never felt any real lulls throughout. The intrigue is enticing and there is enough black comedy to ensure proceedings don’t become too wild - there’s a real maturity to the storytelling here and provides another interesting addition to Brandon’s burgeoning filmography. Cocaine. Bear. The two words that have come to define cinema. This is cinema. This is Cocaine Bear. Right, enough silliness, I’ll leave that for the movie itself. Having taken the internet by storm simply due to its title and premise - that being, a bear feasted on a large amount of ditched cocaine in 1985 - could Elizabeth Banks’ latest directorial effort live up to the hype? Kind of. If you’re going into the movie expecting to see a coked up bear going on a rampage, then you’ll find yourself in luck but…bear…in mind that a hefty chunk of the ninety-five minute runtime is gifted to a host of human characters, most of whom aren’t particularly interesting. Now, this being called a true story comes with the notion that you take that with a pinch of salt, a major amount of liberties have been taken here, but, without those liberties, this would be a very boring movie. Did the real cocaine bear massacre a rabble of misfits? No. But why let the truth get in the way of a drug-fuelled story. At no point does the movie lose sight of what it is though, this is self-aware comedy horror and everyone here is game for the mission - O’ Shea Jackson Jr. and Alden Ehrenreich are both having a blast, as is Margo Martindale, and Keri Russell is dependably solid in her role as Sari, mother of young teen Dee Dee (Prince) who is taken by the bear when she and her friend Henry (Convery) ditch school for a days adventure in the national park. The issue is that the characters themselves don’t really have a lot to them other than their gimmick, and as the movie doesn’t lean in hard enough to each of them, they feel undercooked and underserved. Similarly, whilst the bear brings nothing but terror, the nagging sense that this could have gone harder or wilder never left me. It’s bloody, for sure, and there are some great gags, but I left my viewing feeling like the movie would have been more…fun. Had Banks trimmed some of the unnecessary subplots - including a sweet but unnecessary one about a dog - then the movie would have felt that bit tighter and allowed for more focus on the bear and the humans fighting for survival. For what it is, essentially a jacked up B-movie, Cocaine Bear is still a fun enough ride, however, for a movie called Cocaine Bear, to be left with the feeling that this was not crazy enough is, well...crazy."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE," Weren't comic book movies once joyful and thrilling? The 31st MCU film and the third standalone Ant-Man picture, Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania has a bad premise, an ugly visual style, and lackluster action scenes. It also keeps up the frequent MCU mistake of repeatedly stopping dead in its tracks to set up future movie and Disney+ installments. It's rarely funny, which Paul Rudd's previous MCU appearances usually were. It may be officially ""Phase 5,"" but the new film continues a trend of mediocrity. The Ant-Man movies in the past, in addition to the character's appearances in the Avengers films, have utilized something called the ""Quantum Realm,"" a separate plane of existence, consisting of subatomic particles, which enabled the world to be saved in Avengers: Endgame. Quantumania is set nearly entirely within the Quantum Realm, and its biggest problem is that it hasn't found a way to make the Realm interesting. It's brown and gross-looking, we have no idea how any part relates to any other part spatially, and almost every fight scene is filmed in a combination of shaky-cam and extreme closeup. Director Peyton Reed and writer Jeff Loveness—a rare solo writer for a Marvel film—do a poor job setting up the rules of how the Quantum Realm works, how people got there, and what the stakes are. There are unsubtle Star Wars homages everywhere, including the designs of different creatures, robots, and spaceships. One character essentially re-enacts Darth Vader's death scene, without earning it in any way. It's as though the filmmakers, whenever they hit a dead end, just declared, ""Hey! Get me a guy who looks like Admiral Ackbar!"" Ant-man (Paul Rudd), The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), and the Wasp's parents (Michael Douglas and Michelle  Pfeiffer) all get sucked into the Realm early on, and they have to figure out a way home and navigate the Realm's complicated politics, which include both human and alien-like characters. Among them is Kang (Jonathan Majors), a warlord with designs on future conquests that go beyond the Quantum Realm. The cast is appealing, especially Rudd and Kathryn Newton, and it's great to be reminded that Douglas and Pfeiffer, who somehow made it through the 1980s without starring together in an erotic thriller directed by Paul Verhoeven or Adrian Lyne, are part of these movies. Douglas gets a funny line, in praise of socialism in ant colonies, that's going to make the “Disney is Woke” crowd lose their minds, but really it's just a clever joke. Majors goes all out as the villain, Kang, who I will be a key antagonist over the next several movies. It's a strong turn, although the character's introduction in the Loki Disney+ series last year did a better job setting up his motivations. And since the framing device is set in San Francisco, I kept expecting Majors to show up and go looking for his grandfather's old house, like in the actor's breakthrough role in the fantastic The Last Black Man in San Francisco. There's an occasional good idea, like the strange position Scott Lang finds himself in after saving the world, the use of that ant colony, and a character (The Good Place's William Jackson Harper) who can read people's minds. "
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE," Sequels start out at a deficit. They’re trying to capture lightning in a bottle for a second time, which brings on heightened expectations and lots of messes to trip over. Marvel doesn’t seem to care much about this particular obstacle, because they’re busy making sequels galore.  A few months after “Wakanda Forever” underwhelmed and “Doctor Strange 2” made everything and everyone weird, it’s Scott Lang’s (Paul Rudd) turn to get mixed up in a standoff with a new villain who has the same goals as the last supervillain. The happy-go-unlucky former thief has been reunited with his daughter and enjoys a healthy relationship with his miniature crime fighting partner, Hope aka the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly). Rudd narrations still come off warm, and I honestly could have enjoyed a quiet third entry. No fighting. No fuss.  But complacency is not Kevin Feige’s game. After being introduced in the Disney Plus series, Loki, Jonathan Majors’ Kang The Conqueror has come to play and disturb. He needs Scott’s help with escaping a world of split personalities and entities; basically what makes him stronger is his versatility. So instead of squashing Rudd’s tiny superhero and turning this two hour movie into a short film, Kang “needs” his help.  That’s the beginning and end of my spoilers, but if you’re not a fan of ANY critique of certain plot points, turn away now or forever hold your social media peace.  Here’s the thing. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantamania is an overstuffed, derivative sequel that spends more time introducing a mediocre villain than it does advancing the story of its central characters that fans have grown to love. It goes very hard on the “Star Wars” tributes and aesthetic dry humping, but never gives the audience much to care about or dig into.  Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas are essentially window dressing for the eventual Scott and Kang face off, which holds all the suspense of the fight between Thor and Gorr at the end of last spring’s Love and Thunder. The conflicts here with Kang are similar to Thanos’ mad plan: destroy all superheroes and rebuild the universe in bad guy blood.  Rudd is eternally likable, but he’s merely going through the motions. It’s the by-product of a script that doesn’t give him much to do. I’d die to see him take on a role like the unkempt soul he played in one of Netflix’s first original films, Mute.  Majors is a very intuitive actor, capable of making any sized role intriguing or at the very least entertaining, but even he seems lost here. There are moments where you think his big bad walked in from a different movie entirely, which takes away the film’s focus. It only took two scenes in Infinity War to be petrified of Josh Brolin’s world destroyer. By the time he whipped Hulk’s ass and broke Loki’s neck, we were all in.  In this sequel, Kang doesn’t even show up for nearly an hour. By the time he does, a middling second act is searching for cinema carbs as it tries to compose a reason to exist. All of this is redundant and messy, lacking the polish of those 2018 and 2019 movies.  If this is the start of a new phase in the MCU, I’m moderately underwhelmed and wish they would spend more time bringing new characters to light instead of dragging overused ones back to the spotlight. I loved the first two Ant-Man films because they operated outside of the big dilemma, almost aloof to the events. I liked that. They were like neat and witty lunch breaks.  Part 3 plugs all of it back into Feige and company’s plan, an increasingly bland one. Maybe it’s Marvel fatigue or a simple case of sequelitis, but the magic in these films has ceased to exist.  I want more of each follow up entry, and it all goes back to the outright challenge of a sequel. Can we do more, or enough, to thrill the audience again? With the MCU lately, I’m sad to report that the thrill isn’t gone, but it’s getting there.  My last WTF gripe is about Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and T.I. The three sidekicks of Lang were sorely missed in “Quantamania,” and the script tried pushing more of that remedial mind-reader humor down our throats. Strike one, two, and three. I don’t care if it was about money or ego; failing to retain one of the integral parts of the first two films was a bad idea. "
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE," It feels like Marvel is staring to spin its wheels a bit, with this Ant-Man movie a weird blend of refried Guardians of the Galaxy and a far-less interesting extension of what Loki was doing with all the multiverse hubbub. I hate that this feels so perfunctory, and that the Kang storyline has absolutely nothing going for it. Jonathan Majors squeezes as much as he can out of an underwritten part, but for all the drama they try to infuse into “The Conqueror,” he’s a surprisingly inert big bad for the MCU. You get a generational talent, and this is what you do with him? Everyone talks about how bad Kang is, how “you don’t want to mess with this guy,” how the one you see isn’t even nearly as bad as the ones you’re going to see, but it amounts to nothing. He’s just a guy who shoots lasers out of his hands. He apparently has done all of this horrible stuff, but talk is cheap. The Thanos arc took a bit of a similar approach, bur they cleverly hid him from major screen time until that Infinity/Endgame stretch. I genuinely have no idea how the Kang Dynasty reaches that when it’s just a mess right now, even though I absolutely trust Majors to do the most with the role he can. This one…it’s not really ever convincing enough to hold itself together past the sum of some occasionally engaging sections. Paul Rudd is always fun in the role, but the whole quantum realm stuff just feels like a half-assed attempt to recreate the Guardians vibe. It really doesn’t work as well as you’d want it to, even if there are some fun little creatures and oddities within. The MODOK thing was kind of terrible, though, a ridiculously stupid piece of meta joke that tries hard to zap the piss out of whatever is supposed to be serious with any of this Kang drama. It’s the epitome of “you can’t have it both ways.” Either you think all of this is dumb or you take it deathly serious. Trying to blend it all together just feels insulting to your audience for caring…and this is coming from someone who doesn’t really care all that much about these characters or the story. While some people are horrified by AI starting, like, World War III, I dread the 2-3 years that steamers start letting prediction-based language software write all the inexpensive romantic comedies. Partially kidding…but also not? I’m genuinely not sure why “let’s put Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher together in a romcom!” turned into “let’s do that … but put them in different places the entire movie to zap any sort of chemistry or tension from the story!” I’m guessing money? Shooting availability? Who’s to say. Oh hell yes. This is the M. Night I love, filled with crises of faith, plenty of dread and delightfully obnoxious flourishes of genre command. Dave Bautista and Jonathan Groff trying to outact each other was not on my bingo card, but scene-stealing from Rupert Grint was (shoutout Servant fans who have known). The third act is the most pleasantly restraint we’ve seen Shyamalan be since Split, and this is definitely his best movie since … man … his original golden run. Although I shouldn’t have waited this dang long for a stone-cold masterpiece like Titanic, it was a true joy to see this in a theater for the first time. Those shots of the boat sinking — the grand terror of it all — goodness gracious, man…the swooning, doomed romance…Garber by the clock…Leo the damn movie star…cinema! Cinema, I say! Cinema!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,That&#8217;s what I like about these Marvel films&#44; man&#46; I get older&#44; and they stay the same&#46; 
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL," It’s perhaps not entirely fair to criticise a film in which buildings have tentacles and a supporting character is made of broccoli for lacking logic. But despite a screenplay that seems to be almost entirely composed of exposition (plus the occasional laboured wisecrack), the latest Marvel outing is baffling and illogical. The Ant-man/Wasp blended family unit finds itself sucked into the Quantum realm, something that Wasp matriarch Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) has been notably tight-lipped about since her return in the previous Ant-Man movie. It turns out that Janet has some very powerful enemies in this gaudy CGI-generated sub-atomic dimension. The film’s main asset is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror: his performance, with its velvet-soft line deliveries and unfathomable, boundless rage, is the magnetic core of this incoherent effects-dump of a movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE," Tras una Saga del Infinito que evolucionó en constante crescendo desde su debut con la 'Iron Man' de Jon Favreau, la Fase 4 del Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel fue poco menos que un suplicio. Salvo honrosas excepciones como la solvente 'Shang-Chi y la leyenda de los diez anillos' o 'Thor: Love and Thunder', su amalgama de series y largometrajes se limitó a acumular presentaciones de personaje descafeinadas, formuladas y tremendamente acomodadas; especialmente en lo que respecta a la gran pantalla. En contraposición, el arranque de la Saga del Multiverso fue poco menos que una antítesis de los primeros pasos del MCU. En ellos, la emoción, el espíritu comiquero y la evolución en escala e impacto marcaron el camino hasta una dupla 'Infinity War' - 'Endgame' que supuso un cénit que no ha vuelto a igualarse y tras el que todo se ha hecho especialmente cuesta arriba. Bajo este panorama, la Fase 5 tenía muy complicado lograr que espectadores desencantados como un servidor, a los que ni tan siquiera el FOMO incitaba a regresar a la maraña episódica marvelita, volviese a despertar un mínimo de interés en el macroproyecto de Kevin Feige. Pero, sin esperarlo en absoluto, 'Ant-Man y la Avispa: Quantumania' ha vuelto a poner la suficiente carne en el asador con una sorprendente aventura de ciencia ficción con un encantador espíritu añejo. Uno de los mayores males que achaco a la descafeinada propuesta reciente de Marvel Studios es la falta de factor sorpresa. Ni apuestas multiversales como 'Doctor Strange 2' ni productos más autorales como la soporífera 'Eternals' consiguieron despertar en mí esa sensación de asombro que suele invadirme cuando me sumerjo en las páginas de un cómic. Puede que fuese por la rutina o por la falta de riesgo de las propuestas ambientada en un mundo conocido de sobra; de lo que no hay duda es de que 'Ant-Man 3' ha contado con un arma secreta imbatible para sobreponerse a este problema: su ambientación. El plano de apertura de la película, de una escala gigantesca, se revela como una muestra perfecta de lo que nos va a ofrecer en cómputo global. En este gran plano general se vislumbra un escenario extraño, insólito y hermoso al mismo tiempo que, como un personaje más, canaliza el enorme sentido de la aventura y el espectáculo de un relato casi más hermanado con la línea Weird Science de EC que con la propia bibliografía de La casa de las ideas. Este maro único, que distingue al filme de sus congéneres recientes e impulsa notablemente su atractivo, supone únicamente los cimientos de un título tan sencillo en sus ambiciones como efectivo en sus resultados. Buena culpa de esto la tiene una narrativa que evita andarse con rodeos y que condensa en tan sólo un par de horas —viendo las tendencias actuales 120 minutos no son nada— un equilibrado cóctel de acción, aventura, la comedia asociada a su protagonista y una buena dosis de épica en clave sci-fi. Peyton Reed, que vuelve a cumplir sin problemas con su cometido tras las cámaras, acierta al condensar un brevísimo primer acto durante los minutos iniciales para, a la primera de cambio, sumergir a Scott Lang y compañía en un viaje imposible y divertidísimo que, ahora sí, pone en marcha una Saga del Multiverso que ha estado comatosa narrativa y cinematográficamente hablando desde su arranque a comienzos de 2021. No cabe duda de que, por encima de la interesante dinámica entre los miembros de las familias Pym y Lang, a los que se ha unido una Cassie que funciona a la perfección y que continúa allanando el terreno para los Jóvenes Vengadores, el gran reclamo de 'Ant-Man y la Avispa: Quantumania' es el Kang el Conquistador de Jonathan Majors; probablemente el personaje mejor tratado del funcional conjunto en contraposición de un MODOK aberrante en forma y fondo y tristemente desperdiciado. Tras el breve aperitivo que se nos sirvió en el último capítulo de la primera temporada de 'Loki', la maquinaria del MCU se ha reactivado para presentarnos como es debido al gran villano del arco vigente y comenzar a descubrir las cartas que se jugarán en la trama horizontal de la nueva saga; lo cual no está reñido con cuidar una trama vertical que acierta al centrar su mirada sobre un tema tan mundano y universal como las relaciones y dinámicas familiares. Sin, aparentemente, mayores ínfulas que entretener y ofrecer una experiencia diferente dentro de la apolillada oferta reciente de Marvel Sutdios, 'Ant-Man y la Avispa: Quantumania', pese a no estar exenta de los tics y patrones marca de la casa, supone un inicio fantástico para una Fase 5 que invita a restaurar la confianza en la compañía. Ahora sólo queda comprobar si estas sensaciones son reales o si únicamente nos encontramos ante otro espejismo en un desierto creativo."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,There is a universe out there where Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania is a good movie&#46;&#10;It ain&apos;t this one&#46;
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania brings the number of entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to 31 after it began with Iron Man fifteen years ago. Superhero fatigue, an idea or concept that seemed all but impossible  to even die-hard Marvelites four or five years ago, gets ever closer to becoming a reality for even more of moviegoers. A certain level of sameness, repetition, and predictability has undeniably crept into the MCU. Unfortunately, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania won’t do anything to dispel the overwhelming feeling that the MCU is living on borrowed time. Time, once again, plays a central, even crucial role in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Or, it at least does where Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), the latest MCU foe to don a cape and brood on a self-made throne, is concerned. The time- and multi-verse travelling super-villain is exiled to the farthest reaches of the subatomic universe, the Quantum Realm. We’re told the this place exists “outside space and time.” Persons unknown for equally unknown crimes who didn’t care for Kang’s life choices saw him as a threat on a gargantuan scale and decided that exile was the only option. (Capital punishment, we can presume, wasn’t an alternative.) That all happens a bit later in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, though. When we catch up to one-half of the Ant-Man and Wasp superhero duo, Scott Lang / Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), he’s enjoying the not-so-quite-hard-won fruits of saving the world from Thanos. He’s popular in his ‘hood, acknowledging head nods with one of his own. He eagerly accepts free coffee from the local cafe (although he’s confused for Spider-Man), and has even managed to parlay his nascent popularity into a best-selling novel and a book-reading at a local bookstore where he can bask in the adulation of his devoted fans. Said book-reading ends, though, when Scott gets the call every parent dreads: his teen daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), has been jailed for overzealously protesting the city’s anti-homeless policies. It’s enough for Scott, a one-time felon, to go into overprotective parent mode. However, Cassie is as stubborn, strong-willed, and smart as her father. (Possibly smarter.) She pushes back on Scott’s decision to take time off from being a superhero to enjoy semi-retirement even as the world — not to mention his teen daughter — needs him. Scott’s longtime romantic/superhero partner, Hope Van Dyne / Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), has turned control of her father’s multinational corporation into an actual force for good, pushing renewable technologies, building new homes for the unhoused (apparently not fast enough for Cassie), and otherwise being a good corporate-capitalist CEO and leader. For their part, Hope’s parents, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) spend most of their time avoiding the discussion Hank wants and Janet doesn’t: What actually happened during Janet’s thirty-year stay in the Quantum Realm? We find out the answers to that question and more when one of Cassie’s experiments goes awry. She inadvertently sends the entire Lang-Van Dyne-Pym clan into the Quantum Realm without an easy way out. The screenplay by Jeff Loveness (Rick and Morty, Miracle Workers) separates the travelers into two groups, dropping Scott and Cassie into one flora- and fauna-filled area of the Quantum Realm, and Hope, Janet, and Hank into another. This split sets up a relatively straightforward goal: Meet up, get out, and return to the regular-scaled world. As strangers in a decidedly strange land and audience stand-ins, the two groups meet all kinds of creatures. Some are animal-like, others are bipedal and humanoid. The latter have colours, textures, and shapes of their own. Eventually, Scott and Cassie fall into Kang’s orbit, while Janet, Hope, and Hank discover that there’s a rebellion brewing against Kang’s repressive, dictatorial rule. Decisions good, bad, and consequential follow. That alone will remind audiences of another Disney-owned property, Star Wars, but the comparisons and influences certainly don’t stop there. They stretch back into the 19th century and Jules Verne’s Journey to the Center of the Earth to Edgar Rice Burroughs’ pulp classic, At the Earth’s Core, and right on through to Star Wars, Tron: Legacy, and more recently, Guardians of the Galaxy. To be fair, though, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania generally wears those influences lightly. That’s a plus given the set-up for future entries assumed by Kang and all he hopes to conquer in the future. Undermined like too many recent MCU entries by murky, muddy visuals (somewhat understandable given the environment), an under-motivated, underdeveloped super-villain, a script light on humour and long on family drama, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania at least benefits from an unsurprisingly strong cast.. They’re pros one and all. There’s another winning performance by Rudd as the Most Likable Felon in the MCU. Newton gives a strong turn as Scott’s socially conscious and politically active daughter. Finally, an ultra-committed Majors elevates the underwritten Kang to near Shakespearean heights. That Shelf sat down with Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver’s director and cast to discuss Netflix’s ambitious sci-fi sequel.

"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL," What was initially a cute spin-off for a lesser character who would be integrated into the larger Avengers/Marvel Universe has now been reduced to the type of film a studio releases while they bide time for something bigger and better. The atrocious script is by — get this — not even a TV writer but “Jimmy Kimmel Live” writer Jeff Loveness; that’s the level of desperation here. “It’s a pretty good world. I’m glad we saved it,” Scott Lang’s (Paul Rudd) joyful inner monologue declares in the beginning. Beyond the script, it’s the usual overreliance on special effects and direction (for the third time by Peyton Reed) that just mirrors more successful science fiction franchises “Dune,” “Star Wars” and “Doctor Strange.” Internet forum rules ...

"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania—now playing in cinemas worldwide—is totally unlike its two small-scale predecessors. In theory, that’s great. It shows that Marvel and the filmmakers—including returning director Peyton Reed and new writer Jeff Loveness (Rick and Morty)—are willing to switch it up. As the unwieldy title suggests, they are introducing us to a whole new world, one we visited briefly last time around in Ant-Man and the Wasp. But the trouble with the Quantum Realm, or at least with its visual implementation here for the most part, is that it all feels—well—fake. (Probably more so on an IMAX screen, which is how I saw it.) There’s nothing real about its environments, creatures, or anything else. The entirety of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has been shot on a studio lot in England, with giant screens as backdrops. It’s the same tech they use on The Mandalorian. Having directed a couple of episodes, Reed has experience with StageCraft—as it’s known—but just as Taika Waititi went overboard with it on Thor: Love and Thunder, so does the former here on the new Ant-Man film. While the Star Wars series largely keeps itself grounded, the Quantum Realm is massively over-the-top. Its skies are unreal. Its jungles and animal life are unrecognisable. It’s impossible to locate a horizon. And unlike Earth, the Quantum Realm is seemingly lit equally from every angle. Add to that a lack of foregrounding elements and an overuse of wide bird’s-eye-view shots—they are meant to evoke awe but end up disorienting you—which has a way of flattening and stretching the Marvel movie to an unappealing degree. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is proof of why Rick and Morty should never be translated into live-action. That naturally pulls you out of most scenes, as 90 percent or more of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is set in the Quantum Realm. It also erodes our understanding. The first two Ant-Man films operated on our scale—so when objects shrank or grew, we could comprehend what was going on. The subsequent humour arose out of the mismatched proportions, be it a human shrunk down and navigating scenarios you couldn’t otherwise or seeing everyday objects—from cars to buildings—in sizes you haven’t before. In the Quantum Realm, this doesn’t translate well. Following the universe-altering events of Avengers: Endgame, Scott Lang / Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has settled into a quiet and peaceful life back in San Francisco at the start of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. He’s in a stable relationship with Hope van Dyne / Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), who’s busy with humanitarian work. He’s become a bestselling author with a book that details his save-the-world exploits against Thanos. And having already lost out on five formative years of her life, Scott just wants to be a father to Cassie (Kathryn Newton) and keep her safe. But Cassie isn’t making it easy. She routinely gets herself in trouble with the police while trying to help the underprivileged ones impacted by the Blip. And she’s also been researching the Quantum Realm—with help from Hope and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas)—driven by science and the fear of losing her father again. When Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) learns what Cassie has been up to, she shuts it down. But of course, it’s too late. It says Quantumania in the title for a reason. Maybe they should’ve consulted the one person with the most experience with the Quantum Realm before running any experiments. Though it doesn’t help that Janet hasn’t said a word about the 30 years she spent in the subatomic world since she got back. Due to a combination of foolhardiness and lack of communication, the quintet—Scott, Hope, Cassie, Hank, and Janet—are sucked into the Quantum Realm and split into two. Scott and Cassie run into the remnants of a civilization that’s been ravaged by the one they call the Conqueror. Meanwhile, Janet is slowly forced to open up to Hope and Hank on why she’s been so mum on three decades of her life. Despite having an ensemble of five heroes, the issue with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is that none of them really has an arc. Cassie feels guilty over dragging everyone into trouble but she’s a sidekick and never a driving force. Hank just hangs around to drive a funny spaceship, and—SPOILER ALERT—get highly-advanced ants to the rescue of Scott, Hope, and Cassie in the end. No wonder Douglas wants Hank to be killed off if there’s an Ant-Man 4. Lilly has more or less admitted that this movie didn’t offer enough for Hope. Janet has the strongest motivation of any, as she’s afraid of returning to the Quantum Realm, because of what she escaped. As that can of worms is slowly opened, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania turns into a better film. The Conqueror is revealed to be Kang (Jonathan Majors), a variant of Loki’s He Who Remains (also Majors) who warned us about his other versions before his death. Kang is teased starting at minute 25 in Quantumania, but only properly shows up in his menacing avatar in the second hour. Majors is terrific as Kang—he offers a performance that’s entirely different from the one in Loki—a mega-ambitious time-traveller who feels hobbled by the Quantum Realm. The best parts of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania all involve Majors and none of the VFX shenanigans that populate the new Marvel film. And because of their characters’ shared history, the scenes with Kang and Janet are the highlight. The third Ant-Man film finally gives the talented Pfeiffer enough meat on the bone. That’s also true for Majors, whose Kang has a purpose that everyone else is sorely lacking. Thanks to the villain’s introduction, stronger storytelling, a rebellion plot, and defined action pieces, the second hour of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is greatly improved over the languid first hour. It helps that all the weird and self-serious characters are together. We’ve got a telepath (William Jackson Harper, from The Good Place) with a glowing head. A slime-like creature with no shortage of inappropriate questions and comments. Another with a cylinder for a head that shoots a powerful yellow beam. And of course, MODOK (Corey Stoll, previously the villain in Ant-Man), whose face is stretched in such an unsettling fashion. It just never worked for me. Kang has a problem of his own too. To inform us of his capabilities, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania tells us that Kang has killed multiple Avengers. But since we don’t see any of it, and they are variants of Avengers we don’t care about, it’s impossible to feel anything. Kang’s “might” is also being undone by the fact that he keeps dying every time he shows up. He Who Remains is gone, the Exiled One is gone. In that sense, he’s weaker than prior villains. Does Marvel not realise that it’s undercutting Kang’s supposed dominance by killing off his variants? Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is, ultimately, less than the sum of its parts. It’s sporadically funny. The Quantum Realm is meant to wow us over but feels like CGI puke. And it’s bigger than before—I don’t think it’s an Avengers-level movie, as that’s a heavy dilution of that term—but empty on the inside. Most of its characters aren’t really going anywhere, after all. This was supposed to be the grand entrance for the MCU’s next big bad. Quantumania’s mid-credits scene hints at what’s coming after seven more films in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, slated to release in May 2025. Following a series of standalone adventures since the days of Endgame, the MCU is now building to something. I just wish the path to it was better thought out."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL," Even if you’re just a casual Marvel fan, you’re likely familiar with the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s six phases. Back in 2008, Iron Man was the first film to kick off Phase One, with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) as the final movie of The Infinity Saga. MCU entered the Multiverse Saga in Phase Four and it’s definitely a mixed bag for me, with Eternals and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness being its lowest points. I have to say that once MCU goes all multiverse-crazy, the movies get zanier and more outlandish. Now we’re officially in Phase Five with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. The first Ant-Man movie was a pleasant surprise for me and the personal side of the story of Scott Lang is funny and charming. The second movie Ant-Man and the Wasp which introduced Evangeline Lily as Hope van Dyne and Michelle Pfeiffer as her mother Janet got more complicated but it’s still a lot of fun. Peyton Reed did a great job with the first two movies and he’s back at the helm once again with a script from Jeff Loveness. I noticed that the first two Ant-Man movies had multiple writers, including Paul Rudd himself credited, but this time it’s just Loveness whose main credit is Rick and Morty and he’s never written a feature script before. Well, Loveness sure had his work cut out for him given the expectations to deliver a bigger and even more complex movie that delves even deeper into the multiverse. The movie ties into Janet’s storyline in the second film when she was trapped in the Quantum realm for 3 decades. The eternally luminous Michelle Pfeiffer is always watchable, and she gets to kick some @$$ here. Then the movie switches to earth where Scott Lang is enjoying life as a celebrity. He’s hailed as a hero for saving the world with fellow Avengers and he’s even written a book about it! Rudd is such a likable guy that I’d be up for seeing a movie about Scott Lang instead of his heroic alter ego.  One thing I miss in this movie is Scott’s goofy buddies Luis, Kurt, and Dave, played by Michael Peña, David Dastmalchian and T.I. respectively. Instead, we’re introduced to Kathryn Newton as Cassie, Scott’s now-grown-up daughter. Newton is fine but she looks a lot like Amber Heard that it got a bit distracting. In any case, Scott’s relationship with Cassie is supposed to provide the emotional core of the movie but it feels artificial somehow, and the father-daughter storyline has been done in a much better way in other films. The romance between Scott and Hope is still going strong but we rarely see them together here, pretty much all the human relationships are buried beneath all of the chaotic hullabaloos of the Quantum realm. When the whole Lang family ends up being transported to this dimension, the biggest question they all have is why did Janet keep Kang a secret all this time?? The movie never answers this question, in fact, it seems like all the busyness is a ploy to sidestep that giant plot hole. Visually speaking, it’s definitely not my favorite in the MCU. The set pieces of the Microverse have a deliberate psychedelic look to them, at times it’s a mix between TRON and Star Wars, especially the latter with all the weird-looking creatures in the cantina. The myriad of the underworld population varies greatly in shapes and sizes, from the transparent jelly blob, a creature with a humanoid body and a lamp head, to someone who looks like Xena the Warrior Princess. I have to say some of the character designs are ugly, especially the moving ‘buildings’ that look like inflatable balloon tube man thing-y. Speaking of wisecracks, the Ant-Man movies have been one of the funniest MCU movies and I do still enjoy Scott’s self-deprecating humor. Apart from that though, most of the jokes don’t land well and some are downright cringe-inducing and in poor taste, i.e. the ‘jokes’ about how many holes a human being has is just plain gross. It might be ok in an animated science-fiction sitcom but it’s just so juvenile to have a place in the MCU.  Don’t even get me started about MODOK. That thing might be cool in the comics but it’s just too strange and revolting in this movie. Poor Corey Stoll is reduced to such a weird killing machine, he’s practically the Jar Jar Binks of the MCU to me now. There’s also a notable cameo of a famous actor who’s reportedly been a douche to his co-stars, so his flamboyant wisecracking is not at all funny or amusing. Performance-wise, the clear MVPs are Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors as the new all-powerful big baddie. Majors has a strong screen presence and gravitas but it’s as if he’s in his own universe if you will. He’s menacing but somehow detached from the worlds he’s supposedly conquered and his motivations aren’t very clear compared to say, Thanos, even with his extremely warped logic. I read that Kevin Feige said Major’s Kang the Conqueror got the highest test screening scores in the MCU villain (beating Thanos and Loki). That’s all well and good, if only the script were on-par with the actors’ performances. The movie is only 2 hours and 5 minutes long but it felt like it went on forever. It’s as if time is being stretched out in the Quantum realm. One character made a quip, ‘It’s never over’ which ironically seems to be referring to the endless, mind-numbing chase/fight/battle sequences involving humans & Quantum people/creatures alike. While most superhero movies reserve the most bombastic CGI-heavy action scenes to the finale in the 3rd act, Quantumania spreads them out so the movie is in constant frenetic action mode. Overall, Quantumania is lackluster and quite exhausting to sit through that makes me think Marvel’s glory days might be behind us. Honestly, I’m really not looking forward to the rest of Phase Five. I’m going to see this tonight. I’m looking forward to Kang, but do not have high hopes for the rest of the movie based on reviews. I have zero interest in this film even though I enjoyed the first two Ant-Man films. The visual looks like something from a video game and I’m still in super hero fatigue. I think it’s time for Marvel to slow a bit. Disney is smart by slowing down releasing Star Wars films, so they need to do the same with Marvel. That’s it Ted!! You hit the nail right on the head, it does look like a video game with garish colors. Yeah honestly I’m completely Marvel-ed out now, not sure I’ll be tuning in to LOKI S2 even tho I LOVE Hiddleston in that role. Exact same score I gave it. Pretty disappointing. And it’s not so much that it’s a terrible movie. It’s just so unremarkable. It doesn’t feel at all special nor does it move the MCU forward in a meaningful way. I’m about MCU’d out. Hey Keith! Yeah disappointing indeed, I feel like Marvel is in a rut nowadays in the Multiverse, seems that their old formula is losing its luster. Yep, I’m Marvel-ed out too, which makes me curious if the DCEU shakeup might make me care for DC films now the way I used to for MCU. To each is own. I just prefer the MCU movies that actually go somewhere and do interesting things with their characters. I didn’t feel this movie did either. Agreed, Keith! The filmmakers seem to have forgotten what made the first two movies worked. I for one am SO OVER the whole multiverse craze. I just saw the film and while I did enjoy it.  There were some serious issues as I too was like where’s Luis, Kirk, and Dave?  I missed those guys.  They made the first 2 films fun as well with the 2nd one being my favorite of the three.  I thought Bill Murray’s appearance was a total waste of time as it didn’t really do anything.  The lack of humor really jarred me as I also thought there wasn’t enough urgency with the stakes.  I did like the visuals as well as the cast with Michelle Pfieffer and Jonathan Majors being the stand outs in the film. So we’re pretty much in agreement then as I too miss those three guy friends of Scott Lang and I didn’t care for Bill Murray’s appearance. I do love Pfeiffer and Majors and their quiet scenes together are the highlight for me. There’s elements in the film that I did like which was enough to give it a recommendation of sorts but there were many things in the film that was frustrating.  I wrote a lot in my review of the film as it wasn’t just underwhelming but really weak. Film is in my blood. LOVE movies of all genres, from Jane Austen to James Bond.

"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,And yet&#44; there it was&#44; that thought&#44; overarching and overwhelming&#58; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel a thing&#46;&#8221;
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE," As a surprise for her father Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and for Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfieffer), inquisitive teenager Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has been working on a device with Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) that can map the Quantum Realm. But Janet’s reaction is far from enthusiastic. She wants the device turned off and destroyed. Seconds after Janet’s warnings, a strange energy wave pulls all five into the heart of the Quantum Realm. What they discover there is a world beyond imagining, filled with strange creatures and unique civilizations. Scott and Cassie immediately are separated from Hope, Hank, and Janet, and before they can rejoin their family, the two are taken prisoner by a giant mechanical head named M.O.D.O.K. and presented to the ruler of this bewildering land, the all-powerful tyrant and self-proclaimed conqueror Kang (Jonathan Majors). So begins the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, focusing on the characters first introduced in 2015’s Ant-Man and further developed in 2018’s Ant-Man and the Wasp. Set not too far after the events of Avengers: Endgame, not only does this film work overtime to tell a self-contained adventure of family and togetherness, but it also has the unenviable task of setting up the “big bad” for the next few phases of the MCU. That’s a lot to ask of a character whose best individual moment remains a fight on a miniature Thomas the Tank Engine train track against a pint-sized villain in a mechanical suit that made them look like a weaponized bumblebee. But thanks to returning director Peyton Reed and screenwriter Jeff Loveness’ credit, this sequel comes close to pulling off both tasks. There are a handful of undeniably strong moments, most of them involving Majors, Pfieffer, or both in the same scene playing off one another. But the foundation this multidimensional craziness is built upon isn’t sturdy enough to support all the time-bending, multiversal nonsense. It collapses into visual chaos and audio overload during the final act. There’s no sense of wonder. Any semblance of awe is strangely absent. The humor is forced, and most of the dramatic elements are unnoteworthy. Other than a nice, pleasantly quiet moment between father and daughter amid all the carnage, precious little toward the end provoked an emotional response from me. On the plus side, the great stuff is legitimately fantastic. The first half spends a ton of time on Janet, during which Pfieffer unsurprisingly dominates. Her performance is stirringly balanced, and the way she evokes fear, resilience, anger, and love with such mesmeric ease is astonishing. Janet has been hiding what happened to her during her 30 years in the Quantum Realm for good reason, and watching Pfieffer work her magic as she travels through so many emotional permutations is something special to behold. This is nothing compared to what Majors accomplishes, however. As Kang and his variant selves will likely be the major threat confronting the Avengers from here on in, his entry into the MCU had to be something memorable, and dang, is that ever the case. Majors knows when to speak softly, understands exactly when to twist the volume dial up to 11, and showcases a menacing physicality that’s terrifying. His Kang is a force of determined nature that cannot be easily stopped, and I cannot wait to see what else the actor does with the character moving forward. “Moving forward.” Those two words. That’s the biggest problem that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has working against it. As Marvel announces all of its films so far in advance, even if Scott, Hope, and Cassie end up victorious over Kang, there’s never a doubt that the villain is bound to return sooner rather than later. This makes the final confrontation an unfortunate letdown, for no matter how much effort Majors and Rudd put into their face-off, the idea that anything their characters do to one another has any weight is pretty much zip — and that’s frustrating. I have plenty of additional quibbles, but most of those have to do with the MCU as a whole (the constant quipping, the overreliance on digital sets, climactic action sequences that look like video game cutscenes, etc.) more than it does this specific escapade. There are some inventive visual touches, and while I understand that this depiction of M.O.D.O.K. is not comic-accurate, I actually liked the way the filmmakers connected the cybernetic creature back to the first Ant-Man. Look, even with all my reservations, I did enjoy enough of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania to be happy I took the time to watch it. Those who love everything Marvel does will likely have a blast, and anyone who enjoyed the main character’s first two solo efforts arguably even more so. But for the rest of us, Ant-Man’s return is notable for the villain and not a lot more, meaning this sequel shrinks into the back of the memory rather quickly, disappearing into the multiversal content void almost as if it never existed in the first place.

"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE," There’s a battle within Quantumania, the third Ant-Man movie that feels the least like the previous two. One part of the film wants to expand on the family dynamic of the Pym and Lang collectives. The other part wants to be a fantastical foundation for the future of other Marvel movies. The two clash and ultimately craft a sometimes-entertaining, sometimes-slogging superhero film hindered by its adherence to a shared universe. The stakes feel much lower in this film for Scott Lang (Paul Rudd). Having survived the events of Thanos, someone as chipper as Scott has a sense of contentment to him. And why wouldn’t he? He has a decent level of admiration in public, a sunny outlook on life, and a solid group of family and friends.source: Walt Disney PicturesWith his days of heists behind him, Scott now takes the time to focus on his teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). The problem (or, rather, Scott’s problem) is that Cassie is too much like her father. She’s rebellious against the police, fascinated by quantum technology, and is even starting to get interested in becoming a superhero.With Scott hoping his daughter will make more intelligent choices as she enters adulthood, there’s a more extensive conversation to be had about challenging authority. While that theme remains present, it’s softened by forcing Scott and his family into the quantum realm for a lost-world adventure.Family MattersJoining Scott and Cassie in their quantum realm adventure is the Pym family of Hank (Michael Douglas), his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly), and his wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer). Since Janet had spent decades in the quantum realm before her rescue in the last Ant-Man movie, there are certainly some stories she’s not telling.source: Walt Disney PicturesUnfortunately, Janet’s revelations seem minor and predictable for this adventure. This is perhaps due to how much the quantum realm has changed. The past two Ant-Man movies have portrayed this trippy dimension as a realm that is dangerous to the senses and warps time. In this movie, it looks like just another alien world from Guardians of the Galaxy, complete with creatures who look like plants.A Heavy WorldThere is simply too much going on in the quantum realm that clouds out Ant-Man’s personality. Despite how speedy the world-building is in this odd world, it feels so standard that there’s little surprise in the sight of telepaths, walking energy entities, and living buildings. After all, how much more in awe can you get when you’ve met a talking raccoon from space?source: Walt Disney PicturesThe quantum realm is less interesting for its VFX and more enticing for leaning into the theme of revolution over unjust systems. It’s more fascinating to observe the realm’s chaotic government of rebels and tyrants than its muddy drug-trip backgrounds. That being said, this aspect of social change still stumbles around to make its point, where Hank will give a brief rant about how socialism is such a charged word when describing the collectivism of his ants.Here Comes KangThe central villain present is Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), and there’s little surprise in him being a prime antagonist going forward since an upcoming Avengers movie is called The Kang Dynasty. Majors is great in this role, even if all he’s given to work with is a deadly-serious villain who craves ultimate power. He’s intimidating when calmly making threats and terrifying when he loses his cool. He’s chilling when making calculated threats and frightening when he goes off on a murderous rampage.To make him more connected to this Ant-Man movie, he’s given some history with central characters. While he has a vendetta within the Ant-Man saga, his feud is underwhelming in terms of his drive and fighting. Here’s a guy who can obliterate entire populations with energy in his hands and has a fistfight with Ant-Man.Desperately needing more comic relief, the film dusts off a previous character for the supporting villain MODOK. The concept of MODOK is decently funny with his big head, small limbs, and thirst for bloody revenge. Yet the character’s absurdness feels far too tame, and the film even has to flashback to the first Ant-Man movie to remind you who this guy previously was.A Clash of TonesWhen I think of Ant-Man movies, a brisk nature comes to mind, where critical information is pushed out in playful and exciting ways. In this film, the exposition comes out in lukewarm chunks. Part of this is due to how much is going on within this story, and there’s little time to explore more of the family dynamic.source: Walt Disney PicturesThe enigma of Janet and her legendary status within the quantum realm seems like it’d lead to talk of trust between her and Hank. Sadly, they get over this too quickly amid flying abnormal vessels and shooting at evil armies. Even the presence of Bill Murray as an old flame adds little to the conflict. With so much going on, many exciting elements need to be watered. This makes even the better parts of the picture fall flat, where the fragile ego of MODOK is only mildly amusing, and Hank’s address of socialism feels far too passive in reducing the topic to a common phrase.By the end of the picture, there’s an attempt to put a heartfelt bow on it all but also address the possibility that something darker is on the way. It feels like Scott has to remind us this is an Ant-Man movie and that there’s still some chipperness left in the character and his nook of the MCU.Conclusion: Ant-Man and the Wasp: QuantumaniaDespite an uneven tone, Quantumania mostly works as an enticing superhero adventure, despite how hard it veers away from Ant-Man’s previously zippy nature. This film may get too serious in trying to stress the importance of the multiverse that it doesn’t feel as engaging as more energetic Ant-Man films.

With his days of heists behind him, Scott now takes the time to focus on his teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). The problem (or, rather, Scott’s problem) is that Cassie is too much like her father. She’s rebellious against the police, fascinated by quantum technology, and is even starting to get interested in becoming a superhero. With Scott hoping his daughter will make more intelligent choices as she enters adulthood, there’s a more extensive conversation to be had about challenging authority. While that theme remains present, it’s softened by forcing Scott and his family into the quantum realm for a lost-world adventure.Family MattersJoining Scott and Cassie in their quantum realm adventure is the Pym family of Hank (Michael Douglas), his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly), and his wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer). Since Janet had spent decades in the quantum realm before her rescue in the last Ant-Man movie, there are certainly some stories she’s not telling.source: Walt Disney PicturesUnfortunately, Janet’s revelations seem minor and predictable for this adventure. This is perhaps due to how much the quantum realm has changed. The past two Ant-Man movies have portrayed this trippy dimension as a realm that is dangerous to the senses and warps time. In this movie, it looks like just another alien world from Guardians of the Galaxy, complete with creatures who look like plants.A Heavy WorldThere is simply too much going on in the quantum realm that clouds out Ant-Man’s personality. Despite how speedy the world-building is in this odd world, it feels so standard that there’s little surprise in the sight of telepaths, walking energy entities, and living buildings. After all, how much more in awe can you get when you’ve met a talking raccoon from space?source: Walt Disney PicturesThe quantum realm is less interesting for its VFX and more enticing for leaning into the theme of revolution over unjust systems. It’s more fascinating to observe the realm’s chaotic government of rebels and tyrants than its muddy drug-trip backgrounds. That being said, this aspect of social change still stumbles around to make its point, where Hank will give a brief rant about how socialism is such a charged word when describing the collectivism of his ants.Here Comes KangThe central villain present is Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), and there’s little surprise in him being a prime antagonist going forward since an upcoming Avengers movie is called The Kang Dynasty. Majors is great in this role, even if all he’s given to work with is a deadly-serious villain who craves ultimate power. He’s intimidating when calmly making threats and terrifying when he loses his cool. He’s chilling when making calculated threats and frightening when he goes off on a murderous rampage.To make him more connected to this Ant-Man movie, he’s given some history with central characters. While he has a vendetta within the Ant-Man saga, his feud is underwhelming in terms of his drive and fighting. Here’s a guy who can obliterate entire populations with energy in his hands and has a fistfight with Ant-Man.Desperately needing more comic relief, the film dusts off a previous character for the supporting villain MODOK. The concept of MODOK is decently funny with his big head, small limbs, and thirst for bloody revenge. Yet the character’s absurdness feels far too tame, and the film even has to flashback to the first Ant-Man movie to remind you who this guy previously was.A Clash of TonesWhen I think of Ant-Man movies, a brisk nature comes to mind, where critical information is pushed out in playful and exciting ways. In this film, the exposition comes out in lukewarm chunks. Part of this is due to how much is going on within this story, and there’s little time to explore more of the family dynamic.source: Walt Disney PicturesThe enigma of Janet and her legendary status within the quantum realm seems like it’d lead to talk of trust between her and Hank. Sadly, they get over this too quickly amid flying abnormal vessels and shooting at evil armies. Even the presence of Bill Murray as an old flame adds little to the conflict. With so much going on, many exciting elements need to be watered. This makes even the better parts of the picture fall flat, where the fragile ego of MODOK is only mildly amusing, and Hank’s address of socialism feels far too passive in reducing the topic to a common phrase.By the end of the picture, there’s an attempt to put a heartfelt bow on it all but also address the possibility that something darker is on the way. It feels like Scott has to remind us this is an Ant-Man movie and that there’s still some chipperness left in the character and his nook of the MCU.Conclusion: Ant-Man and the Wasp: QuantumaniaDespite an uneven tone, Quantumania mostly works as an enticing superhero adventure, despite how hard it veers away from Ant-Man’s previously zippy nature. This film may get too serious in trying to stress the importance of the multiverse that it doesn’t feel as engaging as more energetic Ant-Man films.

"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL," Ant-Man’s (Paul Rudd) third standalone outing confirms his status as among the Marvel machine’s most reliably entertaining, if middling, product lines. Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania may be lacking in any discernible drama or emotional stakes but it is easily one of the most solidly entertaining and spectacular of Marvel’s ‘Phase 4’ run of film and television. After an accident with his daughter’s science experiment, Ant-Man aka Scott Lang once again finds himself trapped in the Quantum Realm, the subatomic dimension that exists outside time and space. This time he’s there with daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), girlfriend Hope / superhero partner The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), and her parents, original Ant-Man and Wasp team Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). They’re not alone either: previously seen in television series Loki, Kang (Jonathan Majors) is stuck down here too, brooding and gathering an army to conquer not just our realm, but the entire multiverse. Broadening this threequel out into an ensemble piece is one of director Peyton Reed’s best touches – and indeed is one of the MCU’s strongest suits – and certainly helps to paper over some of this film’s shortcomings. Much of Marvel’s stable has been built around relatable, well-rounded characters while its action and visuals have historically played second fiddle, but the opposite here is true. Aside from some iffy compositing in a few shots, the special effects here are often astonishing, both technically and in their inventiveness, wit and humour, marshalled by the accomplished hand of cinematographer Bill Pope. Indeed, it’s a minor miracle that the CGI looks as good as they do given the disgraceful way that Marvel and Disney reportedly exploit the numerous visual effects houses in their employ. Still, a lot of the editing is choppy, especially during action sequences which relies too heavily on hasty, disorienting cuts in close up. Beyond the overall visual pizazz, it’s the drama that falls short for Quantumania, with a script that’s heavy on plot but light on character and story. It’s certainly tightly structured, never less than entertaining and by now these performers could play their roles in their sleep. There are the obligatory cameos for the fans, a very funny sight gag involving a big giant head and at just over two hours, the thing rattles along nicely without overstaying its welcome. Anyone keeping up with the Ant-Man films will understand the interpersonal relationships between Scott, Cassie, et al, and screenwriter Jeff Loveness is deft enough to give everyone enough to do without leaving anyone feeling redundant. Nevertheless, too often we are left to remember how these characters feel about each other, much less told how they do. Quaint ideas like themes, motivations or character growth are at best paid lip service to and forgotten, presumably victims of rewrites, reshoots or whatever new corporate direction the MCU needs to head in mid-production. As a mechanism the film functions very well indeed – but as a film, as “a machine that generates empathy” as Roger Ebert had it, Quantumania falls vastly short. Still, one might argue that we do not board roller coasters expecting art, and so as an entertainment at that level it is hard to deny that this latest entry fulfils its purpose handsomely, providing all the thrills and spills of the fair. And of course on exiting the ride, there stands Kevin Feige in his red and white stripy suit and straw hat, hawking the next entertainment, and the next. It’s up to audiences to decide how many more rollercoasters and bags of candy floss we are prepared to stomach. But perhaps at some point we might decide whether we might like something a little more substantial."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE," SAN ANTONIO — “Multiverse of Madness.” “Wakanda Forever.” “Quantumania.” As it breaches the 30-film mark, one need only look at the names of recent Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to suspect the franchise is undergoing a bit of an identity crisis. How mad and eternal and manic can these movies really afford to be when the most important for us to consider in any given scene or movie or phase is how it will affect things in the next one?  “Quantumania,” the third “Ant-Man” film and by far the least enjoyable of them, is being regarded as the post-”Avengers: Endgame” effort that charts Marvel Studios' hopes of one day replicating that gargantuan blockbuster’s feat of ultrasaturation. Just look at that tagline, which acts like a marketing-tugged Trojan horse to audiences: We’ve had our fun. Time to get back to business. After a pandemic period of fashionably isolated MCU films that seemed to cross-pollinate more with Disney+ shows like “WandaVision” and “Loki” than with each other, “Quantumania” is ostensibly out to set a chess board where checkmate means sizing our heroes up to someone as big, bad and mean as Thanos.  To that end, “Quantumania” (directed by “Ant-Man” subfranchise trustee Peyton Reed) introduces Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror, whose eponymous pastime is most immediately borne out in generically destructive laserbeams deployed as casually as Disney announcing another dozen projects. He’s overtaken the subatomic quantum realm that is apparently so small it’s ripped from space and time altogether.  Sounds dramatic and all, but that doesn’t do much to invest us when armies eventually meet and sludgy CGI cities come tumbling down. While diehards who tuned in to “Loki” are somewhat familiar with Kang, prior knowledge of him isn’t necessary to understand what he’s up to here… namely because, despite the magnetism of the actor playing him and the literal titles of future MCU projects, there isn’t much we’re compelled to understand other than 1) Kang is mighty strong and 2) Kang is mighty vengeful.  But why? How did he go from exile to overlord? What’s motivating him to conquer worlds and timelines? No insights are offered, which only makes Majors’s performance all the more impressive in its potency. It’s only February, but between “Quantumania,” the upcoming “Creed” threequel and the Sundance standout “Magazine Dreams” for which he’s receiving early Oscar buzz, 2023 is shaping up to be a banner year for Majors. A screen presence of remarkable nuance and creeping volatility, it only makes sense that he was enlisted for what’s expected to be a lengthy MCU tenure.  If only Majors's debut managed to fill the dead air around him. Through 31 films and counting, the MCU has proven its tendency to further tighten the creative leash on directors the more their movies have a role to play in the overarching universe (one of the franchise's greatest what-ifs stems from Edgar Wright exiting the first “Ant-Man” film years ago). So it goes that “Quantumania” is a dispiriting departure from what made superhero Scott Lang’s two prior outings so winning in the shadow of a larger Infinity Saga that chased down cosmic genocide with quips between Doctor Strange and Tony Stark. Plagued by an inability or unwillingness to find a sweet spot between silly and sincere, this supposed franchise resetter is itself in major need of a reset.  Like other recent MCU adventures, “Quantumania” is a family affair whose threadbare plot is set into motion when powerful technology or magic is trifled with. Here it’s a gizmo that acts up and sucks up Scott (Paul Rudd) and his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), into the forbidden quantum realm, a subatomic setting that is actually quite cosmic: Spidery nebulas hang in the distance and colorful CGI blobs glide through massive landscapes that lack depth, dimension or clarity.  It’s also devoid of a reason for us to care about the supposed oppression dished out by Kang. He nearly made it out years ago thanks to the help of Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer, who has participated in superhero projects much more interesting than this), who discovered in ludicrously timely and inexplicable fashion what this supposed castaway would do if he escaped. She hasn't told anyone that story, and too much of ""Quantumania"" hinges on the flattened drama of secrets inevitably divulged.  Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly are also back for the ride as Hank Pym and the Wasp, but rarely are they asked to do more than offer themselves up as gag fodder or provide a telling glance. Narrative payoff is instead reserved for the native, sentient hunk of goo that longs for something so ludicrous to type that I dare not do so here. Much of the excuse for a story that connects “Quantumania’s” scant attempts at invention – most memorably a fiasco that sees millions of Rudds piling up like a living anthill – is revealed in retroactive fashion between scraps of eye-rolling humor and weakling father-daughter conundrums. This is hardly the first time those attributes have been prescribed to a Marvel movie, but in “Quantumania” (written by Jeff Loveness) the only thing rarer than anything resembling our surface world is evidence of a production attempting to compromise its comedic aims with its cataclysmic ones. The movie – so visually ugly that I half-wondered if came down to a projection issue – can’t resist the urge to parody itself. It keeps you guessing about whether the next line of dialogue will be a one-liner or an ultimatum. Yet whatever is uttered rarely fits the situation at hand.  It’s a troubling thing for a franchise to be this much at an impasse when everyone involved insists, fingers apparently crossed behind their backs, that they’re finally forging ahead. “Quantumania” wants to size itself up to a standard-bearer like “Star Wars” but can’t disguise its ant-sized effort. Most frustrating is what amounts to a near-literal confession in the final minutes that, for all the expectation that Kang will be a major villain going forward, “Quantumania” doesn’t chart the franchise roadmap so much as uncrumple it from Kevin Feige’s back pocket. It could’ve been an email. Or a brief mention at a Disney shareholders call. "
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The world is an amazing spectacle&#44; but the writing feels 20 years old&#46;
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE," Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne, along with Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne, explore the Quantum Realm, where they interact with strange creatures and embark on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they thought was possible. After viewing the latest rendition of the “Ant-Man” series, “Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantamania” starring the familiarly jovial Paul Rudd, I felt compelled to write my review as a letter to you both as well as director Peyton Reed. Each year, I subject myself to countless Marvel and DC movies, most of which blur together no matter the Universe. The storylines are all much the same; good guys fight (and fight and fight) the evil bad guy who is set on destroying the world(s). But there was always something different about “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Shazam” (the one with Zachary Levi, not The Rock), and “Ant-Man.” I actually look forward to these iterations of the commonplace super hero movies and now, “Quantamania” has fallen prey to these other formulaic, dull and predictable big budget movies. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is two films in one; that the first is regrettably worse than the other gets things off to a tepid start.  A limp, world building enterprise, the details of which could have been dispensed with in 30 minutes, director Peyton Reed seemingly tempts viewer disinterest, refusing to share key narrative details while bombarding us with one silly, CGI-creation after another. However, the second is a somber, rip-roaring adventure, far different in tone than the previous two entries in this franchise that successfully raises the stakes for the entire Marvel Universe with the introduction of a formidable villain. Had this mood been present from the start, this might have been one of the strongest entries in the Marvel canon, rather than simply a passable entertainment. As always, Paul Rudd has charm to spare as Scott Lang who, after helping the Avengers defeat Thanos and restore half of the Earth’s population, is coasting on his fame, reluctant to don his size-altering suit again. However, he’s forced to play hero once more when his partner Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Hank and Janet Pym (Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer) and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) accidentally get sucked into the microscopic Quantum realm, an incredibly large micro-universe inhabited by myriad groups of creatures who tenuously inhabit an ever-varying landscape, forests of massive fauna butting up against sprawling cityscapes.  There’s more than a bit of “Star Wars” at play here as we’re plunged into this Dali-inspired micro-environment, a universe teeming with numerous cultures and species, each begging for a backstory to be written about them to be used as the basis for a series on Disney+. Having been lost in the Quantum realm for years, Janet has a history with the villainous Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who rules over this micro-verse with an iron hand.  This comes as a surprise to her family, but proves useful once the group sets out to defeat the despot and find a way back to their world.  While this puts Pfeiffer in the spotlight, which is always a plus, one of the more maddening things about the film’s first hour is Janet referring to her past but telling her husband and daughter again and again, “I can’t tell you about it now, we have to go find Scott and Cassie.”  This happens repeatedly and instead of generating suspense, it creates a sense of frustration so great, I nearly gave up on the whole movie. Fortunately, Majors is such a charismatic actor and Kang so intriguing that once he does make his appearance, we’re engaged once more. Reed aggressively switches gears here, the second half of the film becoming more serious than previous “Ant-Man” movies and the film is better for it.  Kang, who has the ability to travel across and destroy timelines in the multiverse, was introduced in “Loki,” his backstory hinted at but not fully explained.  The same remains true here as we are not privy to how he got his destructive abilities, nor why he’s so intent on altering timelines and history.  Obviously, this information is to come as the film’s two post-credits scenes hint of far more Kang in the offing, his character the linchpin for a multi-franchise spanning epic. To be sure, this isn’t first-rate Marvel, but it’s better than most of the Phase Four entries. In addition, the production values and special effects reach the bar the company has set for its product, while the cast, which includes a cameo by Bill Murray, playing “Bill Murray,” doesn’t phone it in and at times, seem to be having fun. In the end, the second act saves the film, as the personal stakes facing the characters are more dire, while Rudd’s angry-father act plays well, adding a sense of gravitas to the requisite big action finale which provides a rousing and poignant finish. These elements, as well as Majors’ star-making turn make “Quantumania” more than a mere placeholder in the Marvel Universe, but just barely."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE," Edwin Arnaudin: You're a longtime comic book reader, but how do you feel about the MCU overall and the first two Ant-Man films in particular? Isa Whitaker: I personally like both Ant-Man films, especially being a father myself and seeing the relationship between Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and his daughter Cassie, and the different trials he’s had to face. Overall, I've really enjoyed the MCU movies, too. I grew up watching the Spider-Man and X-Men animated shows and the original live action films — Sam Raimi's original Spider-Man is my favorite — and since the emergence of the MCU, I've learned about so many other characters I had little or no knowledge about. Edwin: Sounds like we have a similar foundation. Ant-Man never came up in those adaptations, so he was completely new to me when the 2015 film was released. It's such a weird character that I was disappointed by how conventional the origin story felt.  I attribute that flatness to the movie being a mix of ideas from original writer/director Edgar Wright and eventual helmer Peyton Reed. But I far prefer Ant-Man and The Wasp, which is wholly Reed's vision instead of a mishmash of styles. What expectations did you have for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — including the addition of Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors, The Last Black Man in San Francisco) to this series — and were they met, or even exceeded? Isa: I knew that Quantumania was the beginning of Phase 5, and the first introduction of Kang (the MCU's new big bad), and that it would be a deeper dive into the Quantum Realm. I thought Kang showed up and showed out in Quantumania, and thoroughly enjoyed learning more about his origin and seeing his power at work. I’d say my expectations were met, although I would have liked a bit more explanation about the Quantum Realm and the history of it's inhabitants. Edwin: After the MCU checklist feel of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, I feared that Quantumania would get into similar trouble delving into the Quantum Realm as Scott, Hope (Evangeline Lilly), and family are sucked into the sub-dimension. But I was pleasantly surprised by how much information former captive Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer, finally given a chance to shine in this series) was able to provide while on the run and making sense of their unusual predicament. And I agree with you about the Realm's residents. They're just kind of... there. If Disney+ made a series on them, I would definitely watch, especially if they're presented as weird and wonderfully as they are here. This is one bizarre movie with crazy sights up with Thor: Love and Thunder's screaming goats — and I'm here for it! Isa: I would definitely watch that series as well, and I think I'll have to go with Kang for this one. I felt like he grabbed my attention in every scene he was in, and I found myself eager to learn more about his history and his various variants. Some of the Quantum Realm residents were interesting, but didn't really make that big of an impression. Edwin: Majors definitely shows why he’s one of our most exciting young stars early and often, and I look forward to seeing more of him as Phase 5 progresses. He's understandably a serious fellow, not interested in cracking wise, so I was elated to have such oddballs as walking sack of goo Veb (voiced by David Dastmalchian) — as well as his goofy obsession with holes — plus reluctant mind-reader Quaz (William Jackson Harper) and the return of Ant-Man villain Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) in his wacky new M.O.D.O.K. form to lighten the mood. Kathryn Newton (Freaky) as the now teenage Cassie is also a welcome addition. But while I'm one of the world's biggest Bill Murray fans, his all too brief and inconsequential appearance as Lord Krylar made me wonder why he was in there at all. Being an MCU film, there's of course plenty of action sequences and extensive special effects. Did any examples stand out to you as being particularly exciting or eye-popping? Isa: I agree, Veb and Quaz are awesome additions and stand out among the rest, adding comic relief and interesting moments. But M.O.D.O.K. felt a bit out of place at times, like a random throw-in, but was also pretty funny and actually came around in the end. As for the visuals, I've honestly been a little frustrated with the MCU and the way they've handled their special effects. At times I feel like they’re somewhat lacking, and while some of the CGI in Quantumania looks a little choppy, the Quantum Realm is frequently breathtaking. Considering Disney can produce movies as visually stunning as, say, Avatar, I find myself expecting more on the effects side of things. Edwin: I hear you. Quantumania reminded me of the Star Wars prequels and also a trippier version of Dune at times — mostly in a good way. And I'm glad I didn't see it in 3D. The few times I've gone that route with the MCU, the dark visuals make me regret my choice. Overall, I consider this third full-length adventure with Ant-Man a great success and up there with my favorites from Phase 4: Black Widow and Love and Thunder. It was cruising along in solid B-plus territory until the stunning finale, which had my eyes wide with glee. The tag scenes are also particularly well done and nicely set up future films and the second season of a particular TV show that left my fellow moviegoers cheering. All told, it gets an A-minus from me. Isa: I skipped the 3D route as well. It's been a few years since I saw a movie in 3D but I remember being disappointed as it didn't stand up to how 3D movies were in the ’90s. I enjoyed Quantumania overall as well, and would put it up there with Multiverse of Madness and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever — favorites of mine from Phase 4. With some areas of the story and CGI feeling a little weak at times, and the MCU's continuing infatuation with unnecessary crude humor, I'd give it an overall B-plus."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Overall it’s another lackluster blockbuster.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE," Despite a nice family dynamic between the Langs and Pyms, the lack of clarity around new villain Kang and the subpar visual effects make the film a lackluster addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  *This review contains minor spoilers for the film.*Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe proved itself to be controversial in many ways. From a general superhero fatigue to the decentering of the traditional Marvel formula, there was much that fans criticized. However, I relished this new age of Marvel – Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness aside – as the increase in diverse storytelling that it brought felt like a breath of fresh air in the tired franchise. From Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings to Black Widow, we finally had a plethora of films that were made by and about people who weren’t white men.  So it’s perhaps not surprising that I wasn’t too excited for the third installation in the Ant-Man trilogy, directed by Peyton Reed and written by Jeff Loveness, which serves as the introduction to Phase 5 of the MCU. It’s a sequel to Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), but picks up with Scott Lang’s life following Avengers: Endgame. Scott is perhaps one of the blandest Avengers, whose character is only made interesting through Paul Rudd’s charming portrayal. He’s an “every man” who is continually shocked and awed to be considered one of the Avengers, alongside superheroes like Captain America.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania opens with Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) in the Quantum Realm, during her thirty years there. She meets a mysterious stranger that viewers who have seen the Loki TV show know is Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors). The caginess with which the film treats Kang in this opening scene will persist throughout the entire film, as his power is much more discussed than actually seen.  Now that he’s back from saving the world, Scott just wants to spend time with his family, including his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), girlfriend Hope Pym (Evangeline Lily), and her parents Janet and Hank (Michael Douglas). While Cassie is getting into some trouble with the law, it’s for a good cause – a subtle reminder of the unrest in the world caused by the return of half the population from the Blip, which was best explored in the Falcon and the Winter Soldier TV show. She’s bonded with her step-grandparents and has her own Pym suit.  Janet is relishing her return to the normal world and refuses to discuss her time in the Quantum Realm. So she’s dismayed when Hank, Hope, and Cassie finally share that Cassie has been studying the Quantum Realm and has found a way to communicate with it. However, before Janet can explain why it’s so dangerous, the entire family is sucked through a device into the Quantum Realm.  The two sides of the family are separated upon their arrival in the strange world that is a “secret universe beneath ours,” according to Janet. Scott and Cassie try to find their way back to their family but come across a band of Freedom Fighters, while Janet, Hope, and Hank find some of Janet’s old associates, who they hope can help them return to the world above. There’s plenty to test the limits of all five members of the family as they try to reunite and as they explore the risk that Kang poses not just to the Quantum Realm, but to the whole universe.  Unfortunately, the Quantum Realm represents some of Marvel’s worst visual effects work, as everything has a fake sheen to it, and there are seemingly continual reminders that it was mostly filmed with a green screen. The creature design of the plethora of beings there is a reminder of the Star Wars prequels, but Lucas Film improved their creature design in the sequel films. It makes the film seem somehow dated despite coming out in 2023.  The film is at its best when it focuses on the family drama between the Langs and the Pyms. There are parallels between Scott and Janet, who both want to focus on their families, but are reluctantly pulled into helping other people by their children. One of the themes of the movie is, “Just because it’s not happening to you doesn’t mean it’s not happening” and it’s a commendable idea.  However, the film gets bogged down by introducing too many characters. Bill Murray’s Lord Krylar only has one scene, which mostly serves to tell us that Janet had an affair during her time in the Quantum Realm, and Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) returns as a strange mutated creature called M.O.D.O.K. This creature is indicative of another of the film’s issues: its inability to pick a tone. It jumps between comedy (though not as funny as the MCU’s other comedic offerings) and seriousness and the absurd. It’s difficult to buy into the fear and threat of Kang that the film spends over a half hour setting up when it’s constantly bouncing back to make dumb jokes. Majors is definitely capable of being a formidable antagonist, as we saw in Loki, and he gives a good performance in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. However, the film seems unsure of how we should view him. He’s too bad to be the hot morally grey villain that Marvel loves to set up, but we’ve yet to see him do anything truly malicious enough to warrant him being a big bad like Thanos. The film tries to function as an origin series of sorts for him, but by the end, we still don’t know that much about him or have any concept of his powers. "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania sends Marvel’s size-defying heroes on their biggest adventure beyond assisting the Avengers. Yet by teeing up another giant villain for Marvel’s ongoing cinematic universe, the film shrinks some of the duo’s quirky charm and relatable, everyday appeal.  Granted, the effects team makes it stunning in parts, with constantly shifting colors and vistas. We see forests of “trees” like video game mushrooms, giant flying mantas, neon skies, creatures with heads resembling broccoli florets, and living buildings that fly and blast lasers. Nevertheless, I missed the previous films’ creative simplicity, where the heroes resize not just themselves but objects such as salt shakers, PEZ dispensers, cars, and buildings while an army of helpful ants provides backup.  As the film opens, Ant-Man, a.k.a. Scott Lang, enjoys life in San Francisco with his sweetheart, Wasp, and his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton, Big Little Lies), now a young adult. While Wasp, a.k.a. Hope van Dyne, uses technology that her father, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas, The Kominsky Method), invented to supersize food and resources for those in need, Scott tools around San Francisco, promoting his memoir, Look Out for the Little Guy. Rudd’s affable charisma and comic timing are their own superpowers, but here, he also shows sweetness as Scott, an ex-con, relishes being a legitimate hero.  Scott appreciates having a breather after helping the Avengers restore to life the people that the villain Thanos blipped from existence during the Infinity War/Endgame saga. However, Cassie urges him to do more. She gets arrested while helping the homeless, then shows off how Hank has been encouraging her to build a device that maps the quantum realm.  After Cassie’s device zaps her, Scott, Hank, Janet, and Hope into the realm, we learn more about Janet’s earlier adventures and the being she met—a traveler named Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors, the upcoming Creed III). Kang can manipulate time, and his kind exiled him to this realm because of the worlds and timelines he destroyed. Soon Janet and the others learn that he’s made his prison an empire—and now plots how to escape.  The actors’ interplay makes for some amusing and absurd moments, such as when a creature marvels at Scott’s mouth and wonders how many holes he has. (Rudd’s reaction as he does the math is priceless.) When one of Janet’s old flames turns up, a jealous Hank reveals a few things that make Hope want to cover her ears and hide.  Some viewers might have a similar reaction to a former adversary who appears in an unfortunate CGI form. That aside, it’s a treat to see veterans Pfeiffer and Douglas get plenty to do this go-around. Adding the eager and headstrong Cassie to the mix gives Rudd additional depth to play as a proud yet protective parent.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania leaves some unanswered questions, and its action scenes rely more on fisticuffs than clever size-shifting props and fight choreography. It’s still a fun outing with likable characters, just not a fantastic voyage.  Valerie Kalfrin is an award-winning crime journalist turned freelance film writer whose work appears at RogerEbert.com, In Their Own League, Script, The Hollywood Reporter, and other outlets. Also a screenwriter and script consultant, she’s passionate about challenging stereotypes about gender and disability. Let’s tell better stories and tell stories better."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," From Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness to Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Marvel Studios is squeezing a lot into its movie titles lately. It’s a trend that’s a headache for anyone professionally obligated to write about these films on a regular basis, certainly, but it makes sense as the studio attempts to expand its cinematic universe with each film. Title complaints aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania opens up another new, wonderfully weird avenue for adventures in the MCU, but the film’s ambition occasionally outpaces an otherwise fun cast and the intriguing concepts it teases. Directed by Peyton Reed from a script by Jeff Loveness, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania brings back most of the core Ant-Man franchise cast for a story that sends the whole group of size-changing, insect-themed heroes into a weird, subatomic universe to battle a powerful villain attempting to escape exile. Paul Rudd returns as the titular Ant-Man, Scott Lang, alongside Evangeline Lilly as scientist Hope van Dyne, aka the Wasp. They’re joined by Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer as Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne, respectively, the original Ant-Man and Wasp, as well as Kathryn Newton (Freaky) as Cassie Lang, Scott’s daughter. Quantumania pits the returning Ant-Man heroes against Kang, a time- and space-traveling conqueror played by Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country). The character is an alternate version of the character Majors portrayed in Marvel’s Loki series — dubbed “He Who Remains” — and one of many variants of the character he’s expected to play across multiple, upcoming Marvel films. Like the aforementioned Multiverse of Madness, as well as Spider-Man: No Way Home and the last few Thor films, Quantumania feels like a broad, universe-expanding chapter of the MCU, introducing a new, narrative sandbox for Marvel’s characters to play in. Where Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home opened the door to alternate dimensions and Thor extended the cosmic reach of the MCU, Quantumania goes in the opposite direction by going small with the Quantum Realm, a microscopic universe that exists beyond the typical limits of our perception. Marvel and Reed populate the Quantum Realm with a colorful assembly of weird, surreal creatures and landscapes, from sentient buildings and talking broccoli to massive, amoeba-like entities that inhabitants ride around various regions that range from broad deserts and lush, neon-hued jungles to crowded, sci-fi cityscapes. It’s the most trippy environment we’ve seen so far in the MCU — which is saying a lot, given how strange Multiverse of Madness was willing to get — and blends the bright, comic-book palette of Marvel’s movieverse with the bizarre, physics-defying weirdness of an Alejandro Jodorowsky fever dream. Douglas and Pfeiffer are as reliably entertaining as ever, even amid the green-screen spectacle of it all, and have a great chemistry with each other and the rest of the cast. Their roles play to their strengths, and the same can be said of the parts Rudd, Lilly, and Newton play in the film. The Ant-Man family feels like a family, and Quantumania establishes them as the sort of close-knit superhero team Marvel fans typically associate with the Fantastic Four, as they share a bond that goes beyond being mere teammates. Rudd delivers the sort of charming, never-too-serious performance audiences have come to expect from his MCU character (and most of his roles), and even in a cast filled with A-listers, he’s the most entertaining element of any scene he’s in. Marvel has smartly turned Ant-Man into an average Joe hero, and Rudd is the perfect actor to convey the character’s wide-eyed view of a world filled with larger-than-life heroes and villains. On the flip side, Majors is just as perfectly cast as the sinister Kang, whose quietly calm, methodical approach to his sinister ambitions makes him exponentially more scary, while also making the rare moments when he does let loose feel truly terrifying. Kang is a cold-blooded conqueror in the MCU, and Majors finds just the right balance in his performance to sell his devastating potential — even in a world protected by Thor, Doctor Strange, and Hulk. With so much narrative ground to cover, Quantumania delivers some of its most interesting new characters and concepts in frustratingly small portions, teasing the audience with intriguing plot points that never pay off and fresh, fascinating characters that ultimately get left on the side of the road as the main story hurtles along without them. An underused, telepathic character played by William Jackson Harper is one of the most egregious examples of this, and it occasionally feels like Quantumania is more interested in creating new characters than building stories around them. That frantic pace also does a disservice to the story’s emotional beats, which never manage to strike a chord before the plot barrels along. That speedy path through the narrative works fine with the film’s snappy style of humor, but the action never pauses long enough to let the emotional toll of events set in with either the characters or the audience. While Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania never quite rises to the same level as the MCU’s best films to date, it still does enough to keep it out of the bottom tier of Marvel movies — which is a thoroughly entertaining batch of films regardless. Rudd’s performance and the super-family vibe of the heroes’ adventure sets Quantumania apart from other MCU films, and Majors’ chilling portrayal of Kang kicks the entire project up a notch. It’s neither as funny as Thor: Ragnarok (or even prior Ant-Man films), nor as epic as most of the Captain America films, but Quantumania is up there with Multiverse of Madness among the weirdest Marvel movies to date. The MCU has plenty of upcoming projects that fans are excited about, but a potential fourth entry in Tom Holland's Spider-Man series is near the list's top. 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home ended with Holland's Peter entering a new phase in his life. Forgotten by the world and with no one left by his side, Peter is now closer to the perpetually down-on-his-luck version from the comics that fans have come to know and love. The ending is the perfect setup for a new Spidey adventure, with Spider-Man acting as the street-level hero he was always supposed to be. But who should he fight in his new adventure, especially now that he has no Avengers or Avengers-adjacent allies by his side? Ant-Man is tired of being the comic relief. After playing a surprisingly pivotal role in Avengers: Endgame, he's back in his own high-stakes adventure to take on Kang, the time-traveling super villain from the Loki TV series, who seems to be at the center of the next phase of Marvel movies and shows. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania sees Scott Lang's whole family travel to the quantum realm, a trippy, sub-atomic, CGI-heavy dimension. As the Marvel Cinematic Universe has continued to expand, so too have the powers of the people inside of it. What started out with Tony Stark in a mechanized super suit has slowly but unmistakably transformed into a universe filled with beings who are basically and sometimes literally gods. Even so, there are certain characters in the MCU canon who represent the cream of the crop.

"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A solid film that happens to have Ant-Man and The Wasp in it as opposed to being a good Ant-Man and The Wasp film&#44; but it does provide a course correct of sorts while providing needed focus to the saga&#8217;s ultimate threat&#46; 
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," The MCU enters Phase 5 with Peyton Reed‘s trilogy-capper Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, which (re)introduces the main villain/ongoing threat for the next batch of films. One of the challenges that Marvel has set for itself by interlocking all of its films is that they are simultaneously separate from and dependent on each other. That’s particularly challenging for the third Ant-Man, which bears the responsibility of setting up the conflict for the next Phase, while still attempting to tell a compelling standalone narrative for these characters.  Screenwriter Jeff Loveness opens and closes the film with an amusing framing device wherein Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, charming as ever) walks down the street, catching the audience up on his life via voice-over. As the film opens, Lang is adjusting back to a low-key life: he has written a bestselling memoir, girlfriend Hope (Evangeline Lily, sporting a fresh short ‘do) has taken over Pym Industries and her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) are getting reacquainted after Janet’s 30 year stint in the Quantum Realm. It’s a solid, expeditious re-entry before Scott and Hope pick up Scott’s daughter, Cassie (now played by Freaky‘s Kathryn Newton) from jail. Cassie is a burgeoning scientist in her own right, as well as an activist who wants to make a difference in the world. She feels that her father is coasting following the events of Endgame and there’s a disconnect in their relationship because he won’t acknowledge how much she grew up during his 5 year absence during the Blip. The plot kicks into gear when Cassie reveals she’s built a device that sends a signal to the Quantum Realm and everyone is sucked into a vortex. The group is immediately separated into their respective families for separate adventures: the Langs encounter a rebel group of marauders, while the Pyms contend with the dark foe that Janet has a mysterious relationship with.  That would be Kang, the MCU’s new Big Bad, played by the incomparable Jonathan Majors. The break-out star of Lovecraft Country and countless other recent productions is, as expected, excellent in the role. Marvel has a difficult history of creating memorable villains for their superhero films, and while Kang isn’t on par with Thanos or Killmonger, he has plenty of potential. Majors’ soft spoken eloquence is quietly menacing, he has a commanding presence and the character has seemingly limitless powers (Sidebar: while we barely get any skin, the brief glimpse of bicep is clearly still Magazine Dreams-level toned). The issue is that Kang is quite obviously being groomed as the next major MCU villain (a la Thanos) and Quantumania exists principally to (re)introduce him. A variant of the character first appeared as the Big Bad in Disney’s Loki TV series (TVLine has a helpful reminder article if you’ve forgotten how that all went down), but suffice it to say that Quantumania doesn’t do much to expand upon the character’s already established desire to clean up the multiverse of different timelines and, in the process, kill billions. Thanks to the film’s self-imposed hurdles, though, the immediate threat posed by Kang is this film is quite small: he must be kept incapacitated. That means that the whole film is a big case of “hurry up and stop”, where the true conflict is being held back for future films, not this one.  The rest of the film is fine. There’s some fairly broad humour, particularly M.O.D.O.K, a returning character in a new form that Loveness thinks is hilarious and will undoubtedly divide moviegoers. There’s the expected family storyline wherein Scott learns to let Cassie become her own person, though Cassie is far too shallow a character to make much an impression (despite Newton’s charm and clear enthusiasm).  Most frustratingly, after a nothing role in Ant-Man and the Wasp, Pfeiffer finally gets a juicy role in Quantumania. Alas it amounts to keeping Janet tight-lipped about her time in the Quantum Realm for the first half of the film, much to the chagrin of both her family and the audience. It’s Loveness’ attempt to build suspense and delay Kang’s reveal, but the reality is that Janet’s refusal to fill her family in is a frustrating narrative ploy that makes Janet look foolish for endangering her family. Characters repeatedly refusing to divulge important information is a lazy plot device and it saps the enjoyment of the film’s early portions. This is frustrating because the visual look of the Quantum Realm is pretty fun, particularly the introductory world-building. The FX looks good and has, yes, a Star Wars feel in its setting and alien creature design (one almost expects to hear the familiar Cantina music from A New Hope when the Pyms swing by a bar).  Sadly the action is the film’s other letdown, as only the second act hallucinatory set piece wherein Scott multiplies into a million Ant-Mans, really stands out. After two films (and several guest appearances in other Marvel titles), the shrinking/embiggening effects are pretty familiar at this point. Even Kang’s abilities feel reminiscent of Thanos, albeit with a touch of Darth Vader telekinesis. One simply wishes that the film didn’t exist principally to set-up the villain/conflict for the rest of the Phase. Did we really need a two hour and five minute film just to introduce Kang? "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania--Paul Rudd, aka Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man, is taking a little hiatus from front line superhero duty. On inactive status with The Avengers, he's written a book, so he's giving readings, and hanging out with family, and smugly basking in celebrity. That's the set-up, in a few quick scenes in San Francisco, for this third eponymous Ant-Man feature. Then, thanks to science experiments by his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) gone wrong, Scott and Hope Van Dyne, aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) get swept into the ""Quantum Realm,"" along with Cassie, Hope's Mom Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and dad Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). The Quantum Realm is a subatomic micro-verse teeming with life in which Janet was stranded for decades. Thus Janet knows the turf, and she knows that the people there are ruled over by the tyrannical Kang (Jonathan Majors), a dimensional conqueror who she marooned in QR before she escaped. Kang would like very much to be reunited with Janet. Far-out fantasy adventures ensue. Director Peyton Reed seems to pays heavy homage to the original 1977 Star Wars; the Quantum Realm is full of cousins of Tusken Raiders and Jawas. There are also strong echoes of the Avatar flicks, of Zardoz, and of Dr. Who, and maybe a thematic hint of Horton Hears a Who. This is yet another Marvel entry featuring alternate universes; it has a somewhat similar look to Sam Raimi's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness from last year. As with that film, I went in with the feeling that the This-That-Or-The-Other-verse conceit that the Marvels have leaned on so hard in recent years is of limited sustainability, as it has a tendency to dilute the dramatic stakes. On the other hand, also as with Multiverse of Madness, taken on its own terms Quantumania is perfectly enjoyable. The visuals, however derivative, are elegant, witty and well-executed, and the glamorous cast is in pleasant form. Rudd's sly, subtle clowning is always good company, and he carries the movie effortlessly. The best performance, however, is by Jonathan Majors, from The Last Black Man in San Francisco. His Kang is quiet, subdued, even sad, as if haunted by the joyless drive to conquer and rule. As with Christian Bale's Gorr in last year's Thor: Love and Thunder, Majors brings a needed edge of serious, almost tragic menace that helps to ground this silly sci-fi spoof."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," Little “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” opens on large screens all over the place on Friday. A Marvel movie about another drab apocalypse, but with charming fellow passengers to pass the time in charming fashion as noxious clouds swirl, and dim tapestry keeps unfurling in lieu of landscape. The actors give a lot: Paul Rudd, whose ever-youthful mien reminds of the comment by a character in the Monkees’ “Head” that they would like to “run barefoot through Victor Mature’s hair”; Michelle Pfeiffer, taking very seriously a role as a universe-wrecker while lit by Bill Pope (“The Matrix”) as eyes, cheekbones and mischief; the just-rolled-out-of-bed still-embargoed big-name cameo artist; Jonathan Majors bringing sly dignity to the time-jumping multiverse-wrecker Kang the Conqueror and the wonderfully charismatic Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang, part of one more generation of superheroes, if not the first spawn. Classically inclined director Peyton Reed (“Bring It On”) excels at the non-sequitur-driven comedy; the slurry of action is just more Marvel mayhem. Opens Friday, February 17. “Irreversible: Straight Cut” is Gaspar Noé’s 2020 revisiting of his 2002 provocation about a day in the life of a content French couple, played by the then-married Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel. (This is the first American theatrical release.) Of this version, Noé says, “Putting the scenes in clockwise order makes it easier to identify with the characters and understand the tale unfolding. The same story is no longer a tragedy, this time it is a drama that brings out the psychology of the characters and the mechanisms that lead some of them to a murderous barbarity. While ‘Irreversible’ has sometimes been wrongly perceived as a ‘rape and revenge’ B movie, here the deadly outcome is all the more depressing. The film can be more easily seen as a fable on the contagion of barbarity and the command of the reptilian brain over the rational mind.” (Yes.) An interview with Noé on the reediting of his film is here. Opens Friday, February 16 at Alamo Drafthouse. Another stealth release of the work of older filmmakers: a  “Marlowe” starring the seventy-year-old Liam Neeson and directed by the oft-great Neil Jordan, who turns seventy-three next week, is in theaters, from “The Departed” screenwriter William Monahan (a mere babe of sixty-two). “Dick Tracy Special: Tracy Zooms In” (sic) is one of the strangest half-hours in an age, smuggled last Friday night into a late-night slot on TCM. Could it be the last, eccentric gasp of the eighty-five-year-old producer-director-actor? The 2023 Academy Award Nominated Shorts play starting Friday, with live-action and animated shorts at the Music Box and live-action, documentary and animated work all showing at Siskel. “The Master” is a movie that gains from the big screen; I first saw it at the semi-authorized 70mm sneak preview at the Music Box before its release. “This is something you do for a billion years or not at all.” There’s much declaimed about mind and matter and devotion to ideas, ideas that will weather time, in “The Master,” and the teeming result is crafty, chunky delight, an enigma of ape and ego. Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson wrestles with man-vs.-animal in eccentric, compelling, outrageously plush fashion: it’s not just about L. Ron Hubbard and the roots of Scientology, as was rumored before the film’s release. It’s most particular about sterling, physical performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix as battling, wrestling embodiments of flesh and philosophy. (35mm) DOC Films, Friday, February 17. With Damien Chazelle’s “Babylon” now on video after wildly disparate reviews, is it time to reevaluate 2018’s also-underestimated “First Man“? Neil Armstrong steps away. Apart from the crew, the crowd, the fray. Armstrong pauses, looks for calm. He does this a lot in Chazelle’s portrait of loss, mourning, grief and solitude, “First Man.” Several times he lifts his chin, face plain, toward the night sky, toward a waxing moon, a waning moon, never a full one. Neil Armstrong is apart. A part of a huge apparatus, as well, on track to the Apollo 11 mission to the moon, but that is not what interests director Damien Chazelle and screenwriter Josh Singer (“Spotlight,” “The Post”). Armstrong loses someone he loves dearly, and fears loving again in such measure. Ryan Gosling goes deeper into his incarnation of the charismatic mask: the Gary Cooper face that is still, sometimes stock-still, yet always a fraction of a hair from bleakest melancholy. Gosling’s expression in a word: bereft. The trajectory of the space program is strewn with deaths. “First Man” hasn’t fully announced its form until around the middle, where the camerawork calms and we watch the preparations for a test for the first Apollo mission that ends in sparks and fire and death. (The repeated shot on either end of that scene is as terrifying as the black airless void itself.) Loss. Further loss. Armstrong’s resolve. Armstrong’s silence. Armstrong’s PTSD. Gosling’s face. This is where “First Man” tightens the bolts. You can walk on the moon and return home alive but can you face your purest fear, to love in spite of the greatest danger, loss of those you work with, live with, love?  Chazelle’s accomplishment is to restore that single letter, “a”—so small; everything; this piercing movie—which Armstrong left out when he said, “one small step for man,” rather than the planned “one small step for a man.” Claire Foy, as Janet Armstrong, is also kept close to camera, and multiple times barefoot and innocent in long shot, eyes always wide and hopeful, fearful. The gestural strength Chazelle draws from close-ups of Foy is immense, from the slightest turn of her head, from a trickle of fingers, from a canvas of freckles and resolve. Armstrong was a Korean War veteran, like my father, in the Air Force, like my father. Then there was Gosling: silent but not stoic, distant, unaccountable, self-contained, like my father. Thirty-three-year-old Damien Chazelle has captured a generation of men who have left, or are leaving us. The Block, Evanston, Saturday, February 18, 1pm. After the passing of film critic and Black Harvest Film Festival co-founder and consultant Sergio Mims, the Siskel Film Center has established the Sergio Mims Fund For Black Excellence In Filmmaking to honor his legacy of giving a voice and platform to the next generation of Black filmmakers. “Sergio was a family friend for many, many years,” board chair of Kartemquin Films Sylvia Ewing says in a release. “ As a producer, I recall how delightful it was to be first to book him as a guest on Chicago Tonight and other media to share his wit and wisdom. Sergio was a connector, always bringing people together over shared passions and strong opinions. Sergio was deeply committed to giving Black filmmakers a platform to show their work and engage new audiences. This fund is a worthy memorial to his vision to help bring more Black voices to the conversation around film and the film experience.” The fund was established by a planning committee consisting of Black Harvest Film Festival supporters Barbara Allen, Sylvia Ewing, Amir George, N.K. Gutiérrez, Isabelle Martin, Lisa Mims, Troy Pryor and Cleo Wilson. It is administered by Kartemquin Films. More here. Walter Chaw’s ebullient epic career biography and festschrift “A Walter Hill Film” (reviewed here) has more copies stocked in the publisher’s store; $100 for the signed hardcover, $50 for the forthcoming paperback here. “Dick Tracy Special: Tracy Zooms In” is a sequel to 2008’s similar half-hour emanation with Leonard Maltin (who appears again, along with Ben Mankiewicz.) It’s a deeply odd artifact, crafted merely in order to keep  the contractual rights to the character of Dick Tracy in Warren Beatty’s hands, rather than the successors to the Tribune Company. The Los Angeles Times’ Mark Olsen: “Will this be the last thing directed by Warren Beatty?” (Beatty, whose feature debut was in “Splendor in the Grass” in 1961, will be eighty-six in a few weeks.) A lot of the half-hour is just Dick Tracy in a bright yellow coat talking on a Zoom call and some of it is Tracy and Beatty talking at each other about modern movies. Here’s a patch: “By the way, if you ever do make another movie, I think maybe it’d be good for you to have somebody you can argue with. You say you don’t know what to think about making movies now. Well, that’s because things have changed so fast. People want to watch movies at home and put them on pause so they can use their cell phone, so they can break for dinner, so they can go to the toilet, so they can treat movies like books, so they can look at them, put them down, pick them up later. They don’t want to have to drive to a theater, they don’t want to have to park their car. They want to look at whatever they like, whenever they want to look at it. Yeah, sure, sometimes they’ll take the trouble to go to a theater and see a movie on a big screen. fine…. And would you think about maybe getting somebody a little younger than you to play me? But I don’t know. I’m not sure. Maybe I should be played old by somebody who’s able to do things old. People can’t ordinarily do. And you know, maybe it’s better as a series. That’s how we started in 1931 on the funny papers.” Whew? Ray’s history of Chicago Ghost Signs is planned for publication next year. Previews of the project are on Twitter and on Instagram. More photography on Instagram."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Ant-Man and the Wasp is two hours of the last 20 minutes of most Marvel movies&#46; Even viewers who haven&#8217;t experienced MCU fatigue may find themselves feeling it this time&#46;
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," Not settling for just being the third film in a trilogy, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania also has the privilege – or curse – of being first out of the starting blocks for the dawning of Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the all-encompassing goliath of Hollywood since 2008 which hasn’t looked like slowing down anytime soon. Much has been written about its positive and negative impact on the film industry and the now over-reliance on its bank-busting exploits but recent years have perhaps seen the first cracks appear in its seemingly unbreakable armour. Has the sheer weight of worldwide anticipation and expectation started to affect on its master plan? In Quantumania’s case, yes is the answer. After helping The Avengers overcome Thanos once and for all after The Snap, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying his newfound fame as San Francisco’s own superhero. His life with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) is flourishing but his relationship with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) is on shaky ground, with his inadvertent time stuck in the Quantum Realm forcing an emotional gap between them. Ironically, that time away has led Cassie to research more about just what is down there with the help of grandfather Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) but her fascination leads them to send a signal that sees them all sucked into the microscopic universe that Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) hoped to never go back to because of a dangerous man known as The Conqueror. The stakes are certainly high on paper for this one with the introduction of Kang and his conquering habits of bringing our intrepid superheroes to their knees like never before, but for much of the film you don’t feel much for much of the film, you don’t feel there’s any real threat despite Jonathan Majors’ fantastic performance as the new big bad Kang who has only just begun to change the game. There’s certainly spectacle in spades here for fans to sink their teeth into with director Reed utilising the much-loved new The Volume which allows full immersion for fans and for the actors rather than greenscreen but it’s all lacking the usual magic that we’ve seen done better over the past fifteen years. It’s hard to truly call the film a terrible one as its winning cast is always a pleasure to watch (Rudd and Pfeiffer, in particular, carrying the film when Kang-less) but despite all their best intentions and all the love that follows them from the first two films, it all feels surprisingly flat and uninspired. Its welcome and sharp funny bone is sadly lacking under an underwhelming and mawkish screenplay from Jeff Loveness, one that misses the punchier aspects that Adam McKay and Paul Rudd (and, by extension, Michael Peña) had sewn in the previous installments as well as a severe lack of character expansion. It falls into the trap of seemingly being more concerned about the future of the series rather than the here and now, a mistake that continues to undercut their films. For fans, there will be moments here unlike anything they have seen, and they will have a good time watching on the big screen but like many of the other recent MCU efforts, everything feels messy and undisciplined, more as if it’s rushed out to meet a date than anything else and only serves to frustrate than illuminate. There will be better films to come, we’re sure and the future for Kang and who portrays him is very exciting, but on this occasion, they haven’t looked out for the little guy."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," Since the conclusion of the Infinity Saga in 2019, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become quite divisive. What was once one of the most profitable and beloved franchises has become an underperforming and tonally inconsistent universe. Phase 4 was a rollercoaster ride of good, bad, and indefensible entries. While Black Panther: Wakanda Forever concluded Phase 4 on a high note, fans, including myself, have longed for the overarching arc Marvel was known for masterfully executing. As phase 5 commences, it’s hard to wonder if ideologies set up in phase 4 regarding the Multiverse saga would be examined from the start. That question is answered with this first entry: Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, a film that blasts into a galaxy far, far away. While there are plenty of bumps on the journey, it’s hard not to be fully invested in Jonathan Majors’ magnetic presence and Paul Rudd’s contagious charm. Peyton Reed’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania marks the third entry in the franchise, and this entry is its most somber. Following the events of Avengers: Endgame, Scott (Rudd) has become an author, Hope leads a successful career, and Hank and Janet are making up for lost time. Scott’s teenage daughter, Cassie, has been quite busy studying the Quantum realm. Thanks to an invention gone wrong, Scott, Cassie, Hope, Hank, and Janet end up in the realm, where they encounter inhabitants, including a unique conqueror (Majors) longing to escape. While Jeff Loveness’ screenplay evokes the tropes from his Rick and Morty days with the film’s introduction to all the inter-dimensional beings living in the realm, it doesn’t offer credence to Scott’s overlaying arc of time. While it’s mentioned in passing in his conversations with Kang, his desire to recoup lost time is only examined on a surface level, and often time doesn’t blend well with Scott’s comedic demeanor. Loveness’ surface-level exploration also bears true to Kang the Conqueror. While Jonathan Majors is fear-inducing, Loveness’ script and Reed’s direction fail in setting up Kang as the next big bad something that was achieved with Thanos previously. Thanos’s presence was felt throughout the Infinity saga, whether in the film or not. The film’s narrative choices will leave cinephiles wondering how Kevin Feige and company plan to make Kang the ruler of a dynasty throughout phase 5. For those that have been cracking jokes on the Marvel VFX, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania may not be the film to fully rejuvenate faith in the MCU brass as the film leans heavily in visual effects as the film mostly takes place in the Quantum realm. While most of the effects worked for me, the presence of MODOK may disqualify those positive feelings. It’s hard to fathom that a multi-billion dollar company would green-light the final look of MODOK. It is reminiscent of George Lopez’s Mr. Electric from the Spy Kids franchise, only that franchise did not have a machine like Marvel behind it. MODOK aside, there are stunning visuals, including a multi-Ant-Man pyramid that will surely spellbind fans. Where the film is elevated is in its performances. First, it’s always great to see Michelle Pfeiffer, and she’s pretty good in her most meaty role as Janet. It’s a confident performance that will make you wonder why DC Comics has not brought her back as Catwoman, seeing as Michael Keaton is returning as Batman. Despite the change in actress, I found Katheryn Newton to be quite charming as Cassie, and she adds another layer of the possible Young Avengers setup in the future. Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly continue to impress in their roles, while Bill Murray’s cameo was a riot. Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors are the standouts. Rudd continues to charm audiences, and despite its weak screenplay, Rudd evokes a level of emotion unseen by the character thus far. Majors is ferocious and menacing as Kang. It’s the type of performance that gives hope to the future of the MCU despite its rocky phase 5 start. Majors continues to prove he’s one of the best working actors today. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it doesn’t fully take the MCU out of its most recent slump. But, on the other, the film sprinkles different narrative choices that will make phase 5, at the very least, intriguing."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fails to live up to the standard of his first two Ant-Man films&#46;
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The whole film takes place in the green-screen world of the quantum realm; it’s heavy on the visuals with a fairly light, predictable Marvel story."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Ant Man And The Wasp: Quantumania wastes no time. This is a movie that gives us all of six minutes to ease back into Scott Lang’s (an enjoyable enough Paul Rudd) world and get up to speed on the last few years of his life before throwing him into the Quantum Realm to kick off the MCU’s latest adventure. With him on his latest interdimensional adventure are daughter Cassie (a squeaky Kathryn Newton), Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfieffer) and Hope (Evangeline Lilly). Team Ant-Man spends the entirety of the proceedings in said Quantum Realm which they find out is being ruled by evil dictator Kang The Conqueror (a commanding, movie-carrying Jonathan Majors). And Janet Van Dyne has something of a history with Kang. Turns out she’s been keeping a lot of secrets about her activities in the 30 years she spent in the Quantum Realm before getting rescued in 2018’s Ant-Man And The Wasp. (Like this review, this movie doubles as a drinking game - do a shot every time they say Quantum Realm and you’ll be catatonic before the post-credits scene). But as to the aforementioned rushed six minutes - what’s Scott been up to since Avengers: Endgame you ask? He’s been riding the fame of being an Avenger, living off of free coffees, regularly getting asked for selfies and being mistaken for Spiderman. He even wrote a book about his Avenger-ing. (No mention of his podcast Big Me Little Me though, which we saw a glimpse of in Ms. Marvel). In short, Scott traded in the superhero life for the small-time celebrity life, much to the disappointment of his daughter Cassie. His girlfriend and superhero partner Hope, on the other hand, has taken over her dad’s company and has been using the Pym Particle to save the world with science. (I almost laughed out loud. To have a rumoured anti-vaxxer play a science-led saviour? Smooth move Marvel PR team, smooth move). Quantumania packs in a whole lot of plot in its two hours - the world-building of introducing us to the Quantum Realm (shots! shots! shots!); an ensemble adventure for team Ant-Man; an introduction to the villain that will define the next phase of the MCU and even a Star-Wars-style resistance-dictatorship story. And Quantamania is the least bland bland MCU film in a while. Despite being a superhero nerd, I had to rely on Google to remind myself what the recent ones even were. There have been 8 movies since the triumph of Avengers: Endgame. Amidst the tiresome blur of disappointment, a handful have either been promising (Shang Chi, Wakanda Forever) or too “epic” to discount (Spiderman: No Way Home). While it’s hardly a film anyone will look back on fondly years from now Quantumania at least gets its basics of good vs evil stakes right, largely down to Jonathan Major’s movie-salvaging Kang (more on him later). But it takes a while for said forgettable fun to kick in. The patience-testing first leg of Quantumania is its weakest and most irritating as various elements of the movie seem to compete with each other to see which one can take us out of it the most. Whether it's writer Jeff Loveness’ more-miss-than-hit dialogue (Quantumania is a far cry from the zany, imaginative irreverence that made the first Ant-Man one of the MCU’s most underrated films). Or even how the Quantum Realm is brought to life through the film’s indistinct throw-everything-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks visual aesthetic which can only be described as the lovechild of Spy Kids 3D and crayons on crack. What’s particularly off-putting are certain sequences where I could see through the filmmaking. Take the sequence where Scott and Cassie first land in the Quantum Realm. I couldn’t help but see the actors standing on a sand-filled set with what looked like a giant static backdrop behind them. Not exactly what you’d expect from the studio that makes a bajillion dollars each year. With his creation and exploration of this strange new subatomic universe, director Peyton Reed - who, at this point, appears to be competing with Spiderman director Jon Watts for the title of 'MCU director with the most zero-personality films’ - tries to create a James Gunn/Taika Waititi-esque vibrant world full of oddball characters. But all we get is a blurry acid trip of colour upheld by underpaid, overworked VFX artists. Once in said Quantum Realm (I may just be doing it intentionally at this point) Team Ant-Man split in two. Scott and Cassie are off meeting the resistance, led by their near-impossible to take seriously leader Jentorra (Katy O'Brian) who can only be described as decaff Xena: The Quantum Realm princess. Elsewhere, Hank, Hope and Janet are off meeting Janet’s old accomplices and learning about her mysterious past. It’s clear she was a big shot here and knows a great deal about the origins of Kang and his conquering. And yet, in a truly insufferable narrative decision, for some reason, for what feels like over an hour, we get repeated scenes of Hope and Hank asking Janet what the hell is going on, what she knows and what she isn’t telling them. Yet all she does is refuse to divulge anything to them till the plot requires her to. In short, most of the first half of this movie could’ve been avoided with an email. But somewhere along the way in its substandard world-building, I found myself falling into the film (as much as you can with a big, goofy popcorn adventure of empty movie calories). The narrative starts to engage when Kang takes centre stage. Following his introduction in the final episode of Loki, we know he spends his days alongside versions of himself from parallel universes, conquering and destroying entire timelines. It’s the MCU’s version of upping the grand villain stakes - Thanos was the destroyer of worlds, Kang is the destroyer of entire timelines and realities. More than the character, it's how Jonathan Majors plays him that makes him enticing. Majors imbues him with a tragic vulnerability, balancing a creepy calm with an emotionally-charged unpredictability. As if he’s never more than a moment away from seething, scorching rage or breaking down entirely. As Tony Leung did so beautifully in Shang-Chi, Majors out-acts the movie around him. A testament to what great actors can bring to funky fantastical franchises. Kang may be the conqueror of timelines, but he's the saviour of this movie. Though I couldn’t for the life of me tell you what his abilities are or how powerful he is. As Ant-Man, Paul Rudd and seems to be doing the most any returning Avenger can seem to muster these days - turn up and be watchable. Kathryn Newton’s Cassie, however, comes off particularly whiny as the superhero equivalent of a whiny social media activist. Instead, Quantumania belongs to the dignity and grace of Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer who do much to make the proceedings credible and enjoyable. I continue to be impressed with what Marvel has done for stars above a certain age and the significance it awards them. In the end, does Quantumania have me more excited for the next phase of the MCU and its exhausting interconnectedness? Almost slightly. Does it make for a fun standalone superhero adventure? Partially. Now excuse me while I inspire a final shot by thinking of an effective way to end this sentence with the words Quantum Realm. Believe me, it'll help you enjoy this movie more."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," Comic book expert, Erik Laws, returns to talk with Erik Childress about the third Ant-Man film and the beginning of Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Phase 4 did not close out well by either of their standards so they were certainly in the mood for a good palette cleanser. Unfortunately, this one did not go down nearly as smoothly as the previous films with Paul Rudd. They wonder if Kevin Feige has checked himself out more than imagined and why the latest entries have been so bad at melding the super silly with the super serious. There is certainly one element the Eriks agree upon in this chapter that is so good it is a wonder no one thought just a standalone film with their origin story would have been the more interesting kickoff. Thoughts get so meh that talk eventually turns to what DC has up next and how they can sendoff the last of the pre-Gunn era while still looking forward to his own sendoff from the dwindling Marvel Universe."

critic's rating: 



3.0/5

   Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, is the third instalment in the Ant-Man series and kicks off phase five of the Marvel Universe.  The movie, directed by Peyton Reed, takes place in the Quantum Realm and makes us believe that there’s a universe beneath the normal universe which is as vast, extensive and esoteric as our own. It introduces the next big Marvel villain  Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a megalomaniac who can manipulate both time and space. The film pits Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), his wife Hope Van Dyne a.k.a. the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), father-in-law Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and mother-in-law Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), as also his rebellious daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) against a supervillain who likes playing around with timelines and killing people by the planet. He’s so powerful he can annihilate  an entire universes, making him more powerful than even Thanos. He gets exiled in the quantum realm, where Janet van Dyne has also been stranded. They spend years repairing the power core of his spacecraft. However, just as it’s finished, she’s able to read his thoughts and finds out about his evil intentions. She runs away with the power core and deprives him of his escape. Years later, when the family lands back into the quantum realm, they find that Kang has become an all-powerful entity there and has set up an empire. He kidnaps Cassie and asks Scott to get him the power core. Basically, just like Star Wars, a rebellion has been brewing against the evil emperor, and the addition of the Ant-Man family tilts the odds in the favour of the rebels. A battle royale ensues, and all seems to be lost, till Hank saves the day with his army of intelligent ants. They even manage to annihilate Kang but can such a powerful entity really be totally killed? The film draws various references to classic sci-fi movies like the Star Wars franchise, the Dune series, Star Trek, and even the flora and fauna of earth’s oceans. Think of your favourite science fiction character from any novel, or movie you like and something similar to it is in the film. There are so many possibilities that exist within the film as to how the Ant-Man universe can be taken forward that it boggles the mind. The makers have let their imagination go wild and take us through a landscape filled with fantastic creatures and fantastic sights.The CGI artistes are the true heroes of the film, creating landscapes and inspired by deep space telescopes on one hand and a kindergarten kid’s imagination on the other. The creature effects take the cake. What can you say about a slime-like creature who yearns for holes and drinking parts of it gives you instant translation abilities. There is a scene where hundreds of ant-men form a human pyramid. A similar scene has thousands of Kangs sitting in a stadium, hooting like chimps. A sun-like creature, looking gorgeous on the outside, turns out to be a cunning predator. However, amid the technical wizardry, the core idea of the film, a family standing up to an inter-galactic villain, gets lost somewhere. You wonder how Kang is purported to be such a powerful being when a dysfunctional family can overpower it with such ease. It’s all very haphazard and not well thought off. It’s as if the director just wanted to dazzle the viewers with the grandeur of his vision but has forgotten to lend meat to the story. The film feels pretty lopsided because of that. The director has been handed a fantastic cast of proven actors but the final product doesn’t do justice to their collective talent. There are moments which come close to touching you emotionally, like the hint of an affair between Janet van Dyne and Lord Kylar (Bill Murray) and Hank Pym feeling jealous because of that. And Cassie’s teenage angst too adds a spark to the proceedings. But these moments aren’t developed properly and soon peter out.The film is strictly made for die-hard Marvel and Ant-Man fans.

"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," The problem with Marvel movies is a bit like the problem with the American frontier. Eventually, you run out of cheap real estate. The superheroes have been saving the Earth, the universe, the multi-verse, the space-time continuum itself, for so long that the big question becomes, what else is there to save? What can a bad guy conceivably destroy? Ah, but what if we had them go back in time? Sorry, already did that one. A few times. Okay, what about alternate dimensions? Ditto, been done.  Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, which I’m going to be calling Ant-Man 3 from here on out for reasons that should be obvious, has a galaxy-brain solution to the real estate problem: go subatomic. Surely there’s plenty of space left down there squirting around between all those electrons and quarks!  I’ve been begging superhero movies to make the stakes smaller, but not like this. Would you believe “the Quantum Realm™,” where the characters travel to in Ant-Man 3, is basically just every other Marvel movie with a different screensaver background? Yep, turns out it too is just a mess of portals, an all-important energy core, and a bad guy who destroys not only planets, but entire timelines and planes of existence! Not again! So much death and destruction (especially the hypothetical kind, which is mostly what we’re dealing with here) naturally inures audiences to the idea of death and destruction and massive body counts. In the Marvel Universe, we’re on, what, our tenth movie about a planet/universe/timeline/reality smashing bad guy? Now, is seeing so much of it this many times going to make us care more, or less? It’s almost like they’re having a contest with themselves over how much money and manpower they can spend on a monumental, visually spectacular, maximalist FX extravaganza and still have it be boring as shit. Part of the problem is that in a movie economy where movies weren’t glorified NFT schemes, you figure Marvel would’ve killed off Ant-Man long ago. It has to be the weakest sub-franchise. I know that I saw the second Ant-Man movie, because there’s a review to prove it, but I’ve had experiences under general anesthesia that were more memorable. Now we’re back for a third installment, because… well, there are no narrative reasons, only economic ones, and even those are mostly based on groupthink and inertia. If the Marvel Universe movie is going to remain relevant, it’s going to need to start killing off characters, and doing it for real (no time travel tricks!).  The big conflict is that Scott’s daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton) is itching to do superhero stuff while Scott wants her to have a normal life. “Dad, a man dressed as a bee tried to kill me in my bedroom when I was six, I was never going to have a normal life,” Cassie sasses him. Touché, dad. Cassie’s secret science experiment includes a kind of satellite dish for communicating with the Quantum Realm™. When Cassie’s grandmother (Scott’s mother in law), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) sees what she’s done, she screams and tries to break it. Janet, you’ll remember from some other Ant-Man movie, actually spent 30 years trapped in the Quantum Realm™, and there’s something about it she’s never told her family. Basically, that there was a bad guy down there: Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors, who the whole family ends up having to fight when they get sucked down the quantum hole themselves. I thought about that a lot while I was watching Ant-Man 3, which has scenes that exist on the very cutting edge of what is even possible in a movie, visually, and yet are so dull. The action and the emotion are almost completely disconnected.  Not only does the movie barely reckon with the fact that it takes place amongst a population who has seen their universe come just to the brink of collapse multiple times, there’s a bit where one of the characters describes choosing to sacrifice ever seeing her home or family again in order to save billions (maybe it was trillions?) of people she’s never met, on planets and timelines she’s never visited. That’s kind of a huge decision! Ant-Man 3 just treats it as a given and yadda yaddas onto the next thing with nary a comment.  There’s a bunch of “action” here, but it’s all meant to address continuity, not emotion. This movie (and a lot of the sub-par Marvel product lately) doesn’t appeal to viewers’ emotions, or if it does, does so only as an afterthought. The appeal is to continuity, and to the viewer’s innate sense of completism. It’s all based on the expectation that you’ll go just to avoid that feeling of missing out when their next movie inevitably references something that happened in this one. It’s an emotional Ponzi scheme, in a sense, justifying a current debt with the promise of a future return and assuming that this will work forever.  Seeing as it stars Paul Rudd and is directed by a guy (Peyton Reed) once known for comedy, it seems Ant-Man was intended as the sort of comic relief of the Marvel sub-franchises. Certainly, there are “jokes” and “humor” in Ant-Man 3. Yet the jokes too mostly only serve continuity — a couple of yuk-yuks to caulk up a plot hole, the humor of a corporate consultant trying to keep you from falling asleep during a PowerPoint presentation. Jokes this utilitarian sort of just make you feel sad about jokes. The MCU uses comedy the way a super uses drywall filler. The heroes in Ant-Man 3 spend most of the movie in this Quantum Realm™ where no rules seem to apply, and the conflict is over whether they can save millions or billions or trillions of hypothetical people, timelines, and dimensions, which they eventually do using methods that seem like they could’ve done 90 minutes of screentime prior. It mostly all seems like stuff we’ve seen and done before, and it’s hard to care one way or another about any of it. But hey, maybe it will seem important in the next movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," The Marvel Cinematic Universe is so vast that the many franchises within it can vary greatly in terms of tone, ambition, and quality. On the disappointing end of the spectrum are the Thor films, which, with the exception of Ragnarok, reduce the God of Thunder to a meandering himbo. Conversely, there’s the endearing Guardians of the Galaxy franchise that embraces a freewheeling spirit in line with James Gunn’s sensibilities—look no further than Warner Bros. Discovery enlisting the filmmaker to be its creative architect for the new DC Universe as evidence that his superhero movies have a high approval rating. (A third Guardians film will be released this spring before Marvel and Gunn go their separate ways.) But if there’s one franchise that’s gone underappreciated in the MCU’s 15-year existence, it’s the one—rather fittingly, and quite literally—about the little guy.  After a lengthy development process that predated the MCU, with Edgar Wright originally attached to direct, the first Ant-Man movie arrived in 2015 with minimal fanfare by Marvel standards. (To be fair, Ant-Man doesn’t have the same mainstream recognition as heroes like the Incredible Hulk or Captain America.) But that has suited the Ant-Man series just fine: The original blockbuster and its 2018 sequel, Ant-Man and the Wasp, have thrived in their own tiny corner of the MCU, with lower stakes compared to their peers. While other Marvel characters traverse the galaxy or wield mythological hammers, thief-turned-superhero Scott Lang (played by Paul Rudd) spends most of the first Ant-Man planning and executing heists before battling his nemesis in a child’s bedroom: a sequence that uses a Thomas the Tank Engine train set to incredible effect.  With so many Marvel fight scenes devolving into a mindless mishmash of CGI, the action in the Ant-Man movies stands out with its clever shifts in scale. When Ant-Man goes small, water in a bathtub flows like an unstoppable tsunami; when he goes big, he can use a truck as a makeshift skateboard through the streets of San Francisco. With Rudd’s everyman charm and a winning ensemble adept at comedy—Michael Peña’s rambling monologues as Scott’s best friend, Luis, are a work of art—the Ant-Man franchise has been a refreshing change of pace from the rest of the MCU. Unfortunately, all the little things (like Thanos, the size puns are inevitable) that make an Ant-Man film so delightful have been stripped from the latest installment in service of the greater Marvel machine.  As the first entry of the MCU’s Phase 5, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is saddled with setting up Marvel’s next major villain, who will terrorize its heroes for the foreseeable future. While one variant of Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) was already introduced in the Disney+ series Loki, under the moniker “He Who Remains,” his appearance mostly boiled down to warning the characters (and the audience) that his other selves are coming to subjugate all the multiverses. (It was a lot more entertaining than it sounds, thanks in large part to Majors’s magnetic performance.) Right on cue, Quantumania is our first taste of Kang in true conqueror mode, as this version of the villain lords over the Quantum Realm—the subatomic world where all constructs of space and time don’t exist—until the opportunity arises to escape. As for how our diminutive hero fits into the equation, Scott’s teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), creates a device that can send signals down to the Quantum Realm, unaware of the danger it poses until Scott and the extended Ant-Man family—Cassie, Evangeline Lilly’s Wasp, Michael Douglas’s Hank Pym, and Michelle Pfeiffer’s Janet van Dyne—get sucked into the world against their will.  The Quantum Realm isn’t a new concept for the Ant-Man franchise—it’s the place where Janet disappeared for three decades—but it’s never been used as a primary setting in the MCU. Initially, the Quantum Realm is an intriguing sci-fi landscape reminiscent of Disney’s recent animated film Strange World, filled with eccentric life-forms that wouldn’t feel out of place in a Star Wars cantina. (Bill Murray included.) But considering its closest analogue is a movie that comprehensively bombed at the box office, perhaps Quantumania was always fated to be one of the MCU’s worst projects to date.  A similar dilemma arises with the Quantum Realm, which doesn’t play to the strengths of the franchise’s calling card: those nimble shifts in scale. When Ant-Man is surrounded by a CGI landscape with no identifiable characteristics in relation to the real world, the hero shrinking down (or vice versa) doesn’t have the same novelty—instead, these sequences lose any sense of meaning. It’s easy to appreciate a PEZ dispenser being enlarged to obstruct some bad guys during a car chase; the same can’t be said for Scott changing size next to an otherworldly amoeba.  There’s a lot of TV out there. We want to help: Every week, we’ll tell you the best and most urgent shows to stream so you can stay on top of the ever-expanding heap of Peak TV. Maybe it was only a matter of time until Ant-Man had to shoulder some of the universe-building burden from other Marvel heroes, especially when high-profile stars like Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. finally called it quits as Captain America and Iron Man, respectively. But in doing so, we lose one of the underrated joys of the MCU: the stand-alone Ant-Man adventures that were always lighter and more playful than their blockbuster contemporaries. If this is the direction Marvel fans should expect going forward—more projects sacrificing their singular charms at the altar of larger MCU interconnectivity—then it could accelerate the encroaching feeling of superhero fatigue.  It might seem silly to lament that Quantumania doesn’t have the same low-key, breezy vibe as the first two Ant-Man films, which are arguably some of the least consequential entries in the MCU. (That being said, I think we can all agree the complete absence of Peña’s Luis in Quantumania should be a federal crime.) But if the MCU keeps expanding its scope at the expense of what made these kinds of movies crowd-pleasers in the first place, then Marvel will come to realize it isn’t too big to fail. Hopefully, the fundamental misunderstanding of Ant-Man’s appeal in Quantumania, and the unspectacular kickoff of Phase 5, will cut the MCU down to size.  Three days after its release, how’s the double album landing? And was Swift’s approach to this highly personal project successful? Nora Princiotti and Nathan Hubbard discuss on ‘Every Single Album.’ Nora and Nathan are here to dive into the album and discuss ""Fortnight,"" how Swift is grappling with her level of fame, and much more!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," The most unassuming of superheroes, Ant-Man only harnessed his powers by accident, and started his career as a common thief. Nevertheless, the little guy has swung hard at the box office, grossing more than a billion dollars in two previous outings. And as the Marvel universe peters off into various indulgent tributaries, this one’s success has a lot to do with casting. Paul Rudd has carved a career out of playing best friends, boyfriends, sidekicks, hangers on. He moped eloquently as Phoebe’s squeeze in Friends, was a lovelorn drip in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, the sensible in-law in Knocked Up. So it was nice to see him land the lead role in Ant-Man in 2015, an opportunity he grasped with both hands. Rudd has instinctive comic timing, which is just as well, because if the Ant-Man films weren’t funny, they’d be altogether insufferable."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," Along with popular franchises like Iron Man and Spider-Man, Ant-Man is one of my favourites of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe mainly because the stories are different and focus on family drama that is entertaining, lighthearted and never takes itself too seriously. But with the third film Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, which marks the beginning of Phase 5 of the MCU, there is a drastic change from the previous two instalments. The new film embraces a full-on fantasy world, sci-fi adventure and is packed with CGI. It also introduces the audience to a horde of new characters and a new supervillain, and although it sounds quite spectacular, there are problems with the script, an uninteresting plot and it seems to be nothing more than just a set-up for what's to come. Everything has been going pretty good for Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) in the aftermath of Avengers: Endgame (2019). But now he's back with his grown-up daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), his partner Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and his mentor, Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Scott is famous now showing up to events, he has his own book tour and is recognised on the streets. Everything seems golden until Cassie secretly invents a device that results in Scott and his company getting sucked back into the Quantum Realm once again. There, our heroes are stuck in this bizarre microscopic world populated by strange characters. In addition to the various creatures lurking about, there's also Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), the dimension-hopping time-travelling dominator of the multiverse. Once there, the plot of the movie is about Hank, Janet and Hope being separated, trying to find Scott and Cassie, while Kang looks for all of them. The plot for Janet's origin story is attached to the Quantum Realm and how it relates to her relationship with Kang in the first place. And from there we learn a bit about who he is and how he came to power. As many of us know, Marvel Studios now belongs to Disney, the same company that owns Lucasfilm. So don't be surprised to go down into a quantum realm where you feel very familiar with the design as Disney is injecting its intellectual property here, especially Star Wars references. It looks like a vast intergalactic world filled with strange new creatures such as octopuses or broccoli-headed aliens, and giant stingrays that feel very Star Wars-like. There's even a local bar/restaurant with weird-looking musicians that are almost like an Oga's Cantina ripped off. From the start, this movie feels empty with very slow progress filled with the same old flat jokes. The film takes too much time introducing old and new characters with nothing else going on. The first two Ant-Man movies were straightforward and full of laugh-out-loud comedy. However, Quantumania tries to dig deeper to make this a more sci-fi action film like Guardians Of The Galaxy, yet fails at making any emotional connections whether it be between Scott and his daughter Cassie, or Hope and her mother Janet. The film is a lot of things -- loud and supersized but little feels new, visually creative or interesting. It's very clunky. The plot is very repetitive, especially in the first two acts, where characters feel very generic and manufactured. The dialogue and the screenplay are some of the worst I've experienced recently from an MCU film. However, once Jonathan Majors's character Kang comes into the play during the third act, things get slightly more interesting. Kang, whose character is bolstered by an ominous performance from Majors, is set up to portray Darth Vader-plus-Thanos-level horror. And he is basically the highlight that keeps the story and the film interesting. I don't know how the majority of people are going to react, but I can definitely say that Quantumania isn't going to be a movie for everyone. The film definitely felt like episode one and less of a stand-alone movie. So you may enjoy this more as an episode of something greater rather than its own film that concludes a trilogy."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," There is a lot riding on Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania – from delivering on a satisfying conclusion to Marvel’s most consistent, but understated trilogy, to setting up the stakes for the upcoming multiverse saga. Flawed yet fun, much like its titular character, Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is most certainly a theatre watch, given its ambitious and gorgeous visuals. At the beginning, we find ourselves in the middle of an exposition from Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) that takes a look at his life post Avengers: Endgame (2019). A lot has happened in the Marvel cinematic universe (MCU) since then, but all of that is water off a duck’s (or ant’s) back when it comes to Scott. He is in a good place. He has a book out, he’s still well in love with Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), they are using Pym particles to change the world for better. He is well-loved, he is happy, he has friends and most importantly, he has daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who has grown up and aspires to do good too. What could go wrong?  Directed by Peyton Reed, Quantumania’s first half is peppered with the humour that we’ve come to expect from MCU and specifically the Ant Man franchise. That’s all good, because it doesn’t feel as forced as it does in offerings like She-Hulk. However, when Cassie experiments with the quantum realm and the family, including Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (the stunning Michelle Pfeiffer) are dragged into this parallel universe by an unknown force, everything changes. Scattered into two separate groups, the family has to make their way towards each other while battling a secret — it turns out to be one of many — that Janet has been hiding, about her time in this realm. The familial bond between the Langs, Pyms and Dynes remains the core of the film, along with a father’s love for his daughter. From there on, the movie shifts gears from being a comic book movie and a (sub)space opera to an epic war fantasy. Within the quantum realm, we are treated to species, cameos and the world-building spectacle, powered by stunning computer-generated imagery, that we’ve come to associate with the MCU. Visually, this world is arguably more stunning than Avatar: The Way of the Water (2022). If you mean to watch the movie, watch it on the biggest screen possible instead of waiting for it to land on a streaming platform. William Jackson Harper as Quaz (the telepath), Corey Stoll returning as M.O.D.O.K. and David Dastmalchian (in a new cameo) as Veb stand out as supporting characters while Bill Murray as Lord Krylar is wasted for a few whoops of familiarity. The man of the hour in Quantumania has to be Jonathan Majors’ Kang The Conqueror. While Majors is undoubtedly a powerful performer, his villain act lacked the depth of Josh Brolin’s Thanos. This may have more to do with the screenplay than Majors’ acting, but the effect is to give us a villain who unwittingly ends up reminding you of his predecessor. Kang ranges from being menacing to seemingly compassionate, and leans towards invoking empathy from the audience, without actually giving us any reason to do so."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," Lisa Johnson Mandell’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania review wonders how this third Ant-Man installment spun so wildly out of control and became so utterly underwhelming. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania loses viewers in the first 20 seconds. Shadowy characters lurk and lunge about a painfully obvious faux rock set in front of an ill-rendered green screen backdrop. The original Star Trek TV series characters would have been right at home here. “Is this a finished cut?” I wondered as I sat in a critic’s private preview screening. “Do they still have more work to do on it to make it look semi believable?” It had to be the final—the movie was opening in less than a week. It’s a rather inauspicious start for the film that’s supposed to usher in the next phase in the Marvel Universe. It’s a rather weak attempt to establish Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors) as the next super villain of Thanos-sized proportions. Even seasoned A-lister actors like Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas and Bill Murray can’t redeem this shallow, ill-advised, effort. Could it be the worst of the 40+ movies in the Marvel Universe? It certainly gets my vote. This time around we find Ant-Man (the toothlessly engaging Paul Rudd) and his annoying daughter (Kathryn Newton), plus the Wasp (Evangeline Lily with an “interesting” pixie cut) and her parents, played by Douglas and Pfeiffer, all getting accidentally sucked down into the Quantum Realm, where they alternately screw up, crack wise and fight evil. Warning: this is not one of those Marvel movies that generously and adroitly fills you in on what happened last time we saw the protagonist, or visited the Quantum Realm. C’mon! It’s been about five years since  Ant-Man and the Wasp was released. Are those of us who are not avid Marvel devotees supposed to remember all those details? That was half a decade and what seems like dozens of films ago. So while you’re trying to figure out what’s actually happening, who’s doing what to whom and why, you’re subjected to a bloated, busy and baffling CGI world, filled with silly science and ridiculous dialogue. After a short while, you stop caring. Just to remind you, this film was made before Disney announced extensive cutbacks and vowed to focus more on quality than quantity in the Marvel Universe. Now Ant-Man has never been my favorite Avenger, but the previous Ant-Man movies, both also directed by Peyton Reed (who is also responsible for the perfectly serviceable comedies “Down With Love” and “Bring it On”), were mildly entertaining. Lisa Johnson Mandell’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania review wonders how this third Ant-Man installment spun so wildly out of control and became so utterly underwhelming.

"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,While the story isn&#8217;t as compelling as it could be&#44; thanks in part to some choppiness of the narrative&#44; the overall arcs are engaging and this really sets up a villain who&#8217;s a powerful threat&#46; 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Most comic books are dumb. Fun? Yes. But dumb. I am allowed to say this because I have a walk-in closet dedicated to housing thousands upon thousands of them. It’s like the last scene in “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” only I care deeply about organizing and protecting those “top secret” documents, unlike the government. As comic book adaptations now multiply like Gremlins at a waterpark, everybody has to adjust to three big things that “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is bringing to light. For studios: Not every installment can have bonkers-crazy high stakes. If you scream “This changes everything” every time, you are totes being a Chicken Little, and I’m 95% sure he gets eaten at the end of that parable. His meat is very valuable these days. For audiences: You have to set your expectations to “having fun with characters I like” and not “this movie is the culmination of my childhood dreams.” I get that going to the movie theater is cheaper than therapy, but you probably need therapy. For critics: Not liking blockbusters is kinda our thing, I know. Marvel movies and like three of the “Fast and Furious” movies had been the exception. But salivating over the chance to uncork spandex jokes we’ve previously only let fly at DC movies feels fairly desperate. This is all to say: “Quantamania” is fine. Absolutely, totally fine. Several weeks back, lots of people held “Plane” up as an example of a perfectly average, audience-pleasing-but-irrelevant film. It sucked and was offensively ungood. “Quantumania” is cinematic room temperature. It is Diet Pepsi when you wanted Diet Coke. It is a three-day vacation to Six Flags. It is forgettably, meaninglessly, passably entertaining. The whole movie exists only to setup the new big bad guy in the Marvel universe. Scott (Paul Rudd) and Hope (Evangeline Lilly) get sucked into the quantum realm, along with Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), after Scott’s daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), accidentally opens a bridge between the worlds. Filled with weird creatures, some shaped exactly like the best character from “The Good Place” (William Jackson Harper), the “world beneath our world” would be visually stunning if anybody in the quantum realm turned a single light on. I’m not saying it’s dimly lit, but it was just elected to congress. The whole micro-universe is ruled with an iron fist by Kang (Jonathan Majors), whose silly voice will either make you giggle with delight or infuriated. Majors is a massive talent who very much understands the broad, goofy melodrama he’s committed to for the next decade or so of his life. I absolutely love it. Despite everyone in the movie treating him like either Voldemort or how we should be treating JK Rowling, refusing to speak his name and implying awful things about him, Kang doesn’t actually do a lot of uniquely bad stuff. Like, he snaps his fingers and people die. He also shoots laser beams at people and “ends entire timelines,” which should be impressive but mostly looks like stepping on a glowstick. Mostly, he just delivers deliciously dripping monologues. And all that really happens in the movie is that the Ant-Man squad tries to get out of the quantum realm without also releasing Kang. If he does get out, “This changes everything!” The big action set pieces are fine. Although, if the point of the movie is to establish Kang as the biggest, baddest baddie in the history of bad badding, having him be significantly challenged by a couple of characters who can either be very big or very small isn’t helping. Honestly, it would have been fine if the tone had matched the silliness of its simple story: A time-killing God goes toe-to-toe with a superhero known for riding on winged ants. Instead of leaning into the absurdity and genuinely having fun with the nonsense, the most we get is characters basically saying “This is dumb, huh?” There’s a character who is a giant floating head. The best jokes they whip in his direction involve mocking his name and calling him a dick. One scene contains an almost infinite number of Ant-Mans (Ant-Men? Ants-Men? Ants-Mens?). The only laugh is that one of them is wearing a Baskin-Robins outfit. Bill Murray has a cameo that is almost entirely exposition. It needed more “Doctor Who” and less “Infinity War,” more Salvador Dali and less Francisco Goya, more ants and less mans. Because at the end of the day, other than making money, the only artistic reason to have a billion different superhero movies is that they have something unique about them. If they’re all just Armageddon prevention movies a la “The Avengers,” we grow numb to the scope. Ant-Man films should have been a family-friendly comedy series. Instead, they shoehorn in some serious, lame-ass theme about Scott being selfish. He’s literally only been selfless and tried to do the right thing in the other half dozen films he’s been in. And yet, to reiterate, nothing in “Quantumania” is bad. It is shallow, yes. It could have, and arguably should have, been a more delightful experience. Not one single, meaningful event actually occurs. But it is pleasant from start to finish, with frequent outbursts of glee. I’d watch it a hundred thousand times before watching “Avatar 2” ever again. Nobody tell James Cameron I said that. He’s got “Make that guy disappear” money for sure now. Britany Murphy at Muses of Media says “there was a great chance for worldbuilding in the third installment of the franchise, and while it worked in some areas, it faltered in others. The chances were there for the taking, but much of it is lost in sloppy storytelling and exasperating comedic beats.” Kristy Puchko at Mashable says “In the end, with its clumsy collision of influences, star power, CGI that is often rubbery or outright ugly, and a convoluted plot that should have an Excedrin tie-in, ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’ is like a child’s mixed media project, made of paper mache, glitter, and hunks of rotting ground meat.” Siddhant Adlakha at Truthdig says “In the process, its father-daughter story falls by the wayside and ends up being told through hasty character beats. This becomes all the poorer in taste due to invocations of contemporary political ugliness — i.e. the thematic mirroring between police storming homeless encampments and armed guards attacking displaced alien refugees — that yield disappointingly little by way of story, meaning or even visual comprehensibility. Viewers old enough to understand even rudimentary narratives deserve better than a handful of scattered laughs and a great deal of visual unpleasantness.”"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an atrocious movie, but it’s atrocious in a way that Marvel movies rarely are. Up until now, the films of the MCU have for the most part managed to strike up a decent blend of sentiment, jokey humor, and superhero derring-do. When they succeed, it’s because most of these elements are firing at full blast. When they fail, it’s usually because they pushed too hard in one direction or another — the movies are either too sentimental, or comic, or cluttered with unimpressive action scenes. I’ve loved and hated my share of these films (and, as a parent, I’ve had to see just about all of them multiple times), but I’ve never been quite so stupefied by one the way I was by Quantumania. Save for a relatively brief, breezy opening section set in the Marvel present, where Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has written a memoir about his eventful life as Ant-Man and his experiences saving the world in the wake of the Thanos Snap and the ensuing battles, the vast majority of Quantumania takes place in the Quantum Realm, that deadly microworld that you fall into if you shrink so much that you find yourself slipping between subatomic particles. As you may remember, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) was rescued from that land in the previous Ant-Man film. Now, she reveals that she wasn’t alone down there — that a whole universe of beings exists in the Quantum Realm, elaborate and diverse alien tribes in seemingly constant conflict. Among them, we learn, is Kang (Jonathan Majors), an enigmatic traveler whom Janet initially befriended, thinking he was a wayward soul who had accidentally wound up in this dimension. It turned out, however, that Kang was a dangerous, imperious, all-powerful being who had been exiled to the Quantum Realm from his own world. What does any of this have to do with Ant-Man or the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly)? Within what feels like the first 15 or so minutes of the movie, our heroes wind up getting sucked into the Quantum Realm (alongside Janet and her husband Hank Pym, played again by Michael Douglas) when Scott’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) begins sending signals into this world in an effort to map it. It all happens so quickly that I wondered if I was watching a dream sequence. Look, I’m getting bored just typing all this up. More concerningly, it looks like the filmmakers themselves were bored putting it onscreen. When Janet told us there were people down there, she wasn’t kidding: There are rebel tribes, and smugglers, and intricate new aliens, and queasy alliances, and new spaceships, and cantinas. Maybe director Peyton Reed and his collaborators thought they were making a Star Wars movie; the protagonists’ adventures in the Quantum Realm at times look like they were meant to be a knockoff version of George Lucas’s space operas, albeit in compressed form. Or maybe they all just watched Taika Waititi’s Thor Ragnarok once. But good luck finding any of Lucas’s earnestness or imagination, or Waititi’s irreverent prankster sensibility, here. Our heroes’ journeys through the Quantum Realm are presented in totally listless fashion, with the performances failing to convey either the wonderment or terror that the characters should presumably be feeling. Everyone just kind of wanders through this movie — through its elaborate, colorful, cluttered psychedelic-album-cover-style environments. They occasionally crack jokes or cross their arms. Nothing seems to match. If you told me that the actors had been shot before the filmmakers decided what they would be looking at or interacting with, I’d believe you. Even Majors, a fine actor who can usually muster up intensity with seemingly little effort, doesn’t seem to know what to do with Kang. Most of his performance involves walking around and softly muttering his dialogue. You keep waiting for the menace or the grandiosity or the vengefulness to ratchet up — we’re told that Kang is a terrifying, nearly omnipotent being who needs to be prevented from ever escaping the Quantum Realm, lest he destroy the universe — but aside from a few unconvincing, late-inning battle sequences, there really doesn’t seem to be much to Kang. Yes, he can make people levitate and shoot lasers out of his hands, but really, does that feel particularly special in the Marvel world? So the film fails on a basic, meat-and-potatoes comic-book-movie level. It doesn’t even manage to clearly explain the magic doodad (there’s always a magic doodad) our heroes have to recover this time. More importantly, it fails to make you feel anything, which is odd since part of the story involves Ant-Man’s desperate attempts to save his daughter, as ostensibly relatable and immediate a character motivation as one can imagine. But it’s all executed with such little commitment (by otherwise talented actors) that the end result is numb alienation, which is probably not a thing you’re supposed to want from a superhero flick. The action is tired, the universe unconvincing, and nobody onscreen looks like they want to be there. They don’t even look like they know where there is. Quantumania makes you appreciate even more the achievement of something like the Avatar films. There, too, we have mostly ornate, visual-effects-created environments, but they’ve been thoroughly imagined and fully thought through; there’s a vision to them, a consistency and inner logic to go with the awe, which helps with immersion. The Quantum Realm, by contrast, looks like armies of artists and technicians just tossed in whatever struck their fancy. Maybe this patchwork quality was intentional, but as expressed onscreen, it’s a dog’s breakfast of fantasy elements. The first Ant-Man, one of the high points of the whole Marvel cinematic project, was distinguished by its goofy humor and smaller-scale story. At a time when MCU films seemed to be leaning further toward overarching story lines and portentous mythology (all in an effort to build up to the final Avengers pictures, at least one of which was terrific), it came like a breath of fresh air. The smaller scale has all but vanished this time, but some element of the humor remains, albeit in the strangest possible way. Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), the villain of the first film, is reincarnated by Kang as MODOK, a giant, distorted, pathetic head inside a diving-bell-like contraption, with tiny, weak limbs. He looks like a Minion and Max Headroom had a baby. I won’t lie; I did laugh whenever he was onscreen. I’d probably watch a MODOK spinoff series. But it’s hard to decide if Quantumania needs more of this kind of joke, or less. There are a few other stabs at cheeky humor, including a gelatinous creature that gets very excited at the thought of having holes. (It’s funny the first two times it eagerly says “holes,” but eventually you start to live in fear of another “holes” line.) The problem isn’t that such bits aren’t funny — they sometimes are — but that they reveal a noxious carelessness beneath the slipshod filmmaking. This is not humor designed to enhance what you’re seeing, or even to cleverly undercut it. There’s a lifeless bitterness to it all, like a dumb, nothing-matters joke you might make while working a tedious, demeaning job you can’t wait to leave. I’m sure it’ll make lots of money, but Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania might be the first time I’ve ever found myself genuinely sorry for the people who make one of these movies. It feels like a cry for help."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Los dos primeras aventuras del Hombre Hormiga fueron particulares porque se desarrollaron dentro de su propio universo y en los contextos propios del personaje. Pero Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania cambia por completo la dinámica para hacerle saber a la audiencia que se trata sólo de una sección de un rompecabezas más grande. Y es quizás allí en donde flaquea, pierde cierto encanto y revela una narrativa que necesita de otros filmes para poder sobrevivir. No por ello deja de ser una aventura seductora. La nueva odisea de Lang y compañía es un viaje familiar al microcosmos. En su idea de introducirnos al reino cuántico, la trama de esta película es una oportunidad para presentarnos un nuevo mundo, sociedades extrañas que lo habitan y nuevos peligros. Quizá sea el acercamiento más puro que ha tenido Marvel al sci-fi más clásico; ése que huele como al John Carter de Edgar Rice Burroughs y por ende a las películas de Star Wars.  Sin embargo, el guion de Jeff Loveness pronto pierde aquella esencia tradicional y divertida que nos remonta a los códigos de la ciencia ficción. En cambio, decide continuar la agenda del universo cinematográfico de Marvel, para abordar el verdadero objetivo: presentar al personaje de Kang, el Conquistador.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania inicia con un Scott Lang en plenitud. Ahora es el vengador favorito de varios (aunque lo confundan con Spider-Man). Escribió un libro en donde relata sus memorias como superhéroe. Pero lo más importante es que mantiene en estabilidad sus relaciones afectivas, tanto con su hija Cassie (Kathryn Newton), como con el amor de su vida Hope (Evangeline Lilly).  No tan desconocido para Janet quien vivió atrapada en dicho lugar por treinta años y conoció (desató) una amenaza en potencia que busca escapar para conquistar todas las líneas temporales existentes. Así Kang, interpretado por Jonathan Majors, hace su debut en forma en el MCU. Aunque conocíamos una variante del personaje, gracias al capítulo final de la serie Loki, es aquí que somos testigos de la potencia del personaje; de su nivel de amenaza; y de lo que le depara a todos los vengadores en los futuros crossovers. En ese sentido, Quantumania triunfa en su presentación del nuevo villano de la saga. No sólo el personaje de Kang es amenazante, sino que sus motivaciones y características son resueltas con gracia. La idea de un antagonista que conoce el final y el inicio del tiempo, se percibe como algo que está más allá de cualquier otra cosa que hayan enfrentando nuestros personajes. Jonathan Majors es una figura imponente. Si bien el personaje y sus diálogos son acertados, su interpretación le brinda una dimensión todavía más aterradora. Su actuación estoica e impredecible, hace de cada escena con Kang un momento de verdadera tensión. Los fanáticos de los impresos originales estarán complacidos con la recreación de Kang en el live action. No así lo estarán aquellos espectadores más exigentes. En aras de presentar al gran villano y de pavimentar el camino para las siguientes entregas de la saga del multiverso, la nueva aventura de Ant-Man pierde el carisma que caracterizó a sus dos entregas anteriores. Además de Kang, no existe mucho campo de acción para que el resto de sus personajes luzca, o al menos alcancen un arco narrativo distinto del que ya conocíamos. De igual forma las intenciones de construir una aventura de ciencia ficción con nuevos mundos queda en segundo plano. El guion de Loveness desaprovecha la oportunidad de brindarle una personalidad única al proyecto y cae en la trampa de convertirlo únicamente en un puente necesario para otras películas del universo Marvel.  A pesar del ligero dejo de decepción, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, es una película al nivel de su género. Si bien ya no existe ese estilo encantador de espionaje a gran y pequeña escala; o esas narrativas de ladrones en misiones imposibles, al final es una aventura de superhéroes sólida que se vale de su buen humor, su gran despliegue audiovisual y el carisma de su elenco para salir indemne de la experiencia en una sala de cine. Existen algunas secuencias que todavía nos recuerdan por qué nos gustan tanto este tipo de películas. Destellos de brillantez con conceptos como una lluvia de probabilidades; mundos dentro de mundos; el personaje de MODOK, ridículo desde su concepción en los cómics y aquí tratado con esa misma absurdez para generar las mejores escenas de humor; o un villano que de verdad sabe poner a prueba a nuestros héroes y elevar el riesgo. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania es más de lo mismo, pero no se puede negar que lo sigue haciendo bien, aunque su público ya haya perdido la capacidad de asombro. Los fanáticos de Marvel estarán complacidos con dos escenas poscréditos que dan la sensación de que las cosas por fin de ponen en marcha. Pero aquellos que buscan algo innovador, o el giro tan esperado que necesitan los filmes de superhéroes, estarán ciertamente decepcionados.

"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” is a sci-fi adventure that manages to feel both big and small at times, but mostly, comes across as back-to-basics approach for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) - with some ludicrous but fun added in too.  In the film, Ant-Man/Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) — together with Hope’s parents Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott’s daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) — embark on an adventure in the Quantum Realm that push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible. Directed by Peyton Reed, “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” also stars Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror, David Dastmalchian as Veb, Katy O’Brian as Jentorra, William Jackson Harper as Quaz and Bill Murray as Lord Krylar.  The MCU previously opened the door to go beyond the atypical movie trilogy, especially now with the most recent “Thor: Love and Thunder” film being the 4th in that saga, and “Quantumania” doesn’t come off as the concluding film in its story. Instead, the sci-fi adventure introduces us to Kang - who will be the next villain in Phase 5 of the MCU - while also deepening the layers of Scott Lang and his loved ones. The movie itself may not work for some people for this very reason. The scope jumps from being a small family tale to a large action epic focused on overthrowing a conqueror.  “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” is not perfect but it is definitely the best Ant-Man film in the saga, and it also has all the classic Phase 1 MCU texture that many film-goers have recently complained about was missing.  It has the perfect balance of MCU humour but also has some heart and weighty stakes. It’s not as dour as the recent “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” or as silly as “Thor: Love and Thunder”.  While some bits are ludicrous, it’s certainly good fun with some moments feeling like a “Guardians of the Galaxy“ film mixed with “Iron Man 3”. We’ve met an iteration of his character before but in this movie he really completely flips his portrayal of the character and is a formidable and dangerous character.  At some moments, his portrayal does come off as Shakespearean, and that is not a bad thing as it gives some weight to his character that could easily come off as one-note. The film also peels back the layers to Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) as we get a much better understanding of her character here than in “Ant-Man and the Wasp” - which is where her character was introduced. In actuality, it’s Evangeline Lilly’s character The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne who doesn’t really get much to do emotionally, but the film makes up for this by upping her character’s physical presence, making her a more formidable heroine. The film does attempt to contrast her relationship with her mother, to the relationship Scott and Cassie has, but it is very subtle about its approach.  “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” does miss out on playing up Cassie and Hope’s relationship but this is fertile ground that they probably left unexplored so that it could be delved into in future movies. For those expecting a grandiose story with large stakes, this movie will deliver. Marvel has ultimately delivered a film that harkens back to the MCU of old but it also leaves us with questions wondering where to next and just how dangerous things will get in the future.  It drives home the perils our heroes will face in the future, while not missing out on giving us the laughs and fun that makes going to the cinemas enjoyable. "
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," In the enjoyable opening to the latest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, sometime Ant-Man Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) reveals he has written a memoir entitled Look Out for the Little Guy. Fair warning. It may have cost a squidillion dollars, but Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, at least at first, feels like welcome relief from Marvel at its most pompously grandiose. It is the little guy in the MCU. Scott ambles about San Francisco. He joshes with his wife Hope “The Wasp” van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). Hugely overqualified personnel – it’s Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer again – turn up as his dimension-surfing in-laws. A sitcom with these people would not be an appalling idea. That doesn’t last. Before too long, they are sucked into the nauseatingly lurid parallel universe we are obliged to call the Quantum Realm. We are still (and will be for some time) processing material made during the height of the pandemic. So, we shouldn’t blame the filmmakers for creating 90 per cent of AMATW: Q in a barn outside Slough. But it does irk a little that the environment looks so like every second cover to science-fiction paperbacks from the 1950s. Have no new worlds occurred since? Anyway, hectic and not overlong, Quantumania does bumble along amiably enough for the succeeding 90 minutes. Jonathan Majors, among the best actors of the rising generation, treats the role of Kang the Conqueror with the unnecessary seriousness that Orson Welles and Lord Olivier once brought to their own slumming-it villains. Douglas keeps a straight face while piloting a semi-sentient spaceship by ramming his arms up two damp orifices in the style of a country vet checking for intestinal abnormalities. Imagine a Roger Corman film made with the combined budgets of every Roger Corman film and you are halfway there. No doubt grad students at Marvel University will detect pointers to whatever will soon happen in whatever “phase” we have reached (five? twelve? 126?). If you seek political allegories there is – as there was in DC’s absurd Black Adam – something here about a cruel regime building on the bones of an oppressed people’s dead. But the thing works best as a largely unpretentious diversion that makes no demands on any part of the brain yet to evolve when humans were still worshipping trees."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," The third chapter in Peyton Reed’s micro Marvel super-saga Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania looms large over Presidents’ Day weekend, and all indications are it will be another blockbuster entry to kick off Marvel Studio’s Phase Five. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Kathryn Newton star as a heroic family ensemble trapped by and forced into battle against Jonathan Majors’ despotic villain Kang, first introduced in the Disney+ MCU series Loki, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumanium. It’s an impressive cast that also includes a few surprise appearances and cameos as well. I offered my pre-screening box office predictions earlier this week, and now that I’ve seen Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania I think my prior expectations are still mostly accurate, although through the four-day period — Monday is Presidents’ Day in domestic markets — I think it’s likely to fall on the higher side of estimates and land closer to $290+ million in global receipts. I’m still betting on a final cume in the rage of $850+ million for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. but as I mentioned last time, a “moderate” $750 million outcome would still be a huge leap over Ant-Man and the Wasp’s $622 million back in 2018. We’ll have a better idea after Monday’s box office receipts are counted, and when we’ve got good data on audience reactions and word of mouth after Friday screenings. If anything holds Quantumania back, it will be early reviews which are currently skewing negative, a rarity for Marvel. As long as the Cinemascore from the public is at least a B+, I don’t think the negative critical reviews will hurt its box office. Marvel films are probably review-proof at this point. But as we’ve seen post-Infinity Saga the films aren’t quite hitting the same constant high box office levels due to myriad complex factors, with Spider-Man: No Way Home being the only film among the past eight Marvel releases to top $1 billion. So if the Cinemascore is a B and the reviews continue to remain sub-50% at Rotten Tomatoes, then I think there is a chance the film might wind up being more front-loaded and finish its run on the lower end of estimates — namely, still around $750+/- million, which would be another welcome increase for the franchise and position the film as a successful launch of villainous Kang the Conqueror’s cinematic presence. However, I don’t expect low audience scores for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. The film will probably be the most success and most audience-pleasing yet of the series precisely for some of the reasons a lot of reviewers are complaining about the film — it’s the biggest Ant-Man movie yet (at this point you’ll just have to accept unlimited amounts of unintentional and intentional puns, sorry) and it tries something new for its solo franchise, with a more MCU-like visual and tonal feel. ( I could note here that a lot of reviewers complain about Marvel films for being “the same,” and then the same folks complain about them for changing things, but if I took every opportunity to point out laziness, inconsistency, and bandwagon narratives in the entertainment press, I’d spend most of my time just talking about that...) It’s also the franchise’s first entry since Rudd’s hero played a prominent role in Avengers: Endgame, so awareness and appreciation for both Ant-Man and the Wasp is a lot higher this time around. And most of all it’s a good, entertaining, visually splendid sci-fantasy movie willing to take its premise and leads in a new direction. While previous Ant-Man movies focused on either putting a shrunken hero in a recognizable world that towers over him, or reversing things to put a giant hero in a recognizable world he towers over, Quantumania finally takes us all the way deep into the Quantum Realm and reveals a whole alien world there to explore. The result is a plot largely focused on the relationships and arcs for Pfeiffer and Majors, while Rudd and Newton have a father-daughter have a more one-note arc consisting of a father trying to repeatedly find and save his daughter. One of the more distracting aspects of the film is the fact Rudd, who is usually front and center in these stories, is really in a supporting role that mostly puts him in action sequences or inexplicable Quantum Realm revelations where we have fun watching his wowed reactions and laughing at his jokes. We get to see Rudd and Newton interacting a lot, and we get some early familial relationship scenes that tend to be the best character moments in this franchise, but then the rest of the film sees the team split up and trying to reconnect as they traverse the crazy environment and meet up with competing groups of creatures, aliens, and people trying to survive and accomplish their own missions — after all, unlike our heroes, the rest of the lifeforms in the Quantum Realm live there and won’t be leaving. The film still works well overall, and it’s not really a criticism or complaint that other characters get more time in the spotlight and carry the weight of the story on their shoulders, even if I think Rudd’s character should’ve been given a bit more complexity to his own arc and interactions with Newton. For the record, Newton does have an emotional arc about trying to use her knowledge and experience to help her world, and then applies the same moral reasoning to trying to help the beings living in the Quantum Realm. But I think this should’ve been a louder subplot, and it misses several opportunities to tie more overtly and effectively into the larger narrative and helped elevate Rudd’s own arc and actions. Again, I’m convinced a significant reason for the mixed reactions and negative reviews are due in large part to the combination of this reversal of character focus plus spending most of the film in the fantastical new world of the Quantum Realm, as well as the larger stakes that feed into and set up the rest Phase Five’s overarching story, is all so different from what most folks expect from an Ant-Man and the Wasp film. I’m not unmindful of the fact that, in the aftermath of the immense buildup and anticipation through the Infinity Saga, culminating in the two-part Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, many viewers might feel exhausted by the sprawling amount and intensity of watching all of these interconnected superhero films. It’s also understandable if at some point some viewers decided they’d seen and heard all they need to see and hear from this particular franchise or collection of franchises. But the sheer entertainment spectacle of the Quantum Realm — finally revealed in all of its glory after so many years of buildup — and the wonderful tour we get of the place throughout the film, with cool and unexpected additional reveals coming even in the third act, is worth the price of admission. A great deal of work went into crafting the weird creatures and crazy landscapes that fill Quantumania, as well as the costumes and makeup on the array of aliens and monsters and plants. You’ll have to rewatch it a few times if you want to catch everything, because most of the film takes place in the Quantum Realm so the screen is perpetually full of this stuff. It’s lovely to behold, fun and amusing, and much of the film’s joy is found in just experiencing this strange land and its inhabitants. There’s a great bit with a town whose buildings can move around by themselves, and it brings all sorts of great unanswerable questions to mind in the way this sort of absurdist fantasy should. The biggest inspirations for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania are fairly obvious, including the classic Fantastic Voyage and the Mad Max movies, with a sprinkle of Thor: Ragnarok and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. All great stuff to take inspiration from, for sure, while keeping it all solidly within the MCU’s larger established world and — despite all of the new directions it takes — plenty of familiar Ant-Man elements. Majors, too, earns your ticket price with one of the best MCU villain performances to date, and I’m a big fan of the emotional depths to this character, including his flashback scenes and even later scenes trying to convince everyone they’re making huge mistakes. It’s great to see a villain who is certainly undeniably villainous and selfish, but who’s a different sort of threat and who still has a very good point. All of the cast are up to the challenge here and do their usual bang-up jobs, although I’ll again note Rudd probably could’ve used more direct emotional tie-ins to the larger themes and plot points to elevate his role in the film (an odd thing to say about the lead, I know). Still, everyone gets their moments to shine, even Rudd and including Michael Douglas in a welcome surprise development. Quantumania is at its best when characters are knee-deep in this ever-shifting micro-world, reacting to and interacting with the fantastical beings who inhabit the place. When you add Majors’ Kang to the mix and some nice backstory that gives Pfeiffer her best scenes and arc of the series — all part of the interactions surrounded by and shaped by the Quantum Realm and its large cast of other amazing characters — there is much to enjoy and admire about the film. It’s also still more humorous than most other MCU films besides the Guardians of the Galaxy series, just less so than before. If you love Marvel movies, if you love these characters and have fun watching them in new situations, if you’re ready for a clearer look at where the future of the MCU is heading this time around, then Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has plenty to offer you. It’s not top-tier Marvel, but nor is it bottom-tier as the excessively negative reviews would have you believe. It’s solidly mid-tier (I’d in fact argue it’s upper-mid-tier), and if you haven’t figured this out yet, mid-tier Marvel is still miles ahead of most other franchises. Be sure to check back soon for more reviews, news, and box office updates. And if you venture to theaters to see Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania this weekend, please remember to wear an N95 mask — we are still in a Covid pandemic that’s killing several hundred people in the USA every weeks, with new variants spreading rapidly while immuno-compromised and other at-risk people depending on YOU and ME to wear our masks to help protect them. So do your part and mask up!"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," Even drowning in a day glow colour scheme and overrun with a collection of creatures who look like rejects from Jim Henson's workshop there's a certain listless quality Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania shares with too many Marvel movies. Then Jonathan Majors strides on screen and rescues it from the morass of mediocrity. Cast as Kang the Conqueror, Majors is suited up in a green and purple costume, the now recognizable Marvel mixture of plastic and latex, his face marked with prosthetic scars.  The Kirbyeque colour scheme does him no favours. But when he speaks, you lean in a little closer. You feel the character's weariness. Even his pauses are riveting. This is the face of a man who has stared into the yawning maw of the infinite. This isn't Majors' first film. Far from it. He was featured in the HBO series Lovecraft Country and the highly underrated The Last Black Man in San Francisco. Now he's having a moment.  Fresh from his appearance as a pilot in the film Devotion, he's already earning raves for his performance in the buzzy Sundance film Magazine Dreams and will go toe to toe with Michael B. Jordan next month in Creed III. Even with his face hidden behind a shimmering blue force field, he gives the despot a certain sense of vulnerability. There's a sad kindness in his gaze before the inevitable energy bolts appear.  The first decade of the Marvel Cinematic Universe had a plan: A carefully laid out arc with Iron Man and the villain Thanos slowly building toward a blockbuster conclusion. In the post-Endgame era of Marvel movies it often feels we're still chasing the same high from the previous films as the magic ebbs away.  So what do you do after you've saved the Earth, the universe and everything? If you're Lang, you pose for selfies and write a book. Luckily for him and us in the audience, inventor Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Lang's teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), have been mucking around in the quantum realm. When their research project goes awry, all three of them, along with Hank's wife and daughter, Janet and Hope van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer and Evangeline Lilly, respectively), are pulled into the microverse.  Like Jodorowsky's Dune come to life, it's a wild and woolly realm filled with fungal-like forests, cotton candy skies and creatures that resemble extras from the Mos Eisley cantina. The only redeeming feature of the quantum misadventure is that it provides Scott and Cassie some much needed daddy-daughter time. Newton doesn't have much to work with, but she shines as a teen trying to follow in her father's footsteps.  Marvel fans know Quantumania is the beginning of a much larger storyline, the much hyped ""Phase 5"" of the MCU. If you don't know your Juggernauts from your Jokers that may not mean much, but all you really need to know is we'll be seeing a lot more of Majors, and that's a good thing.  As for the tiny titular hero? When he first appeared in Ant-Man back in 2015, Rudd's real super power was his irreverence. As"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," From his first introduction in 2015’s ANT-MAN, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has always been one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s sunnier characters. Scott is a good-hearted former thief who got into the superhero life accidentally by coming into possession of a suit that allowed him to become tiny, or huge – and to communicate with ants. The first ANT-MAN, while live-action, was so playful as to at times resemble a Pixar film. Parts of the new ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA may remind viewers of yet another Disney subsidiary, Lucasfilm. QUANTUMANIA has the feel of a STAR WARS movie – not the more recent glum stuff, but the oh-how-cool-and-enjoyable-and-what’s-this? sensibility of the original trilogy. QUANTUMANIA even gets into fighting an evil empire, with battles that have unique elements, but still give off something of a STAR WARS vibe. 2018’s ANT-MAN AND THE WASP was about how Scott, Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), who has her own supersuit as the Wasp, and Hope’s father and the suits’ inventor Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) got together and rescued Hank’s wife/Hope’s mother Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) from the quantum realm, where she’d been trapped among the tardigrades for three decades. The quantum realm is a place of subatomic tininess that is in effect its own universe, or rather one of many tiny multiverses. For earlier explanations of the multiverse, please check out SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME (2021), DOCTOR STRANGE AND THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS (2022), and the first season of Disney+’s LOKI (2021). For viewers new to (at least most of) the whole shebang here, LOKI may be the primary material to watch before QUANTUMANIA. The series not only gets into the nitty-gritty of the multiverse concept, it also introduces QUANTUMANIA’s primary antagonist, Kang (Jonathan Majors). Indeed, it may be a bit confusing to look at (or remember) the end of ANT-MAN AND THE WASP, since Janet – along with Hope and Hank – are encouraging Scott to explore the quantum realm to obtain something to help someone. (Then the blip came, leaving Scott stranded in the quantum realm; then the unblip came in 2019’s AVENGERS: ENDGAME. Those unfamiliar with the blip, please research elsewhere.) In ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA, it turns out that Janet was not entirely candid about what happened during her thirty years in the quantum realm, and would rather nobody ever go back there. (Hence the “Say what?” about the end of ANT-MAN AND THE WASP.) But no sooner does Janet start to explain herself than she, Hope, Hank, Scott and Scott’s now-teen daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton, new to the role) all get sucked into the quantum realm. Director Peyton Reed, who also helmed the previous ANT-MAN movies, and screenwriter Jeff Loveness bring a lot of sheer likability to the proceedings. Reed also makes great use of how CGI and motion capture can create various beings, and gives a kind of Maxfield Parrish does sci-fi look to the quantum wilds. This being a Marvel movie, there’s also lots of action. The climax may cause many people to reflect that we probably don’t need to see every single permutation of two people slugging and stomping it out, but that’s the fashion nowadays. The cast is perfect. Rudd has just the right amount of goofiness and self-engagement, along with an underlying kindness, as Scott. Pfeiffer makes it easy to believe that Janet makes a huge impression wherever she goes, Douglas has deft comedy chops, and Newton is wonderfully game as the family idealist. Lilly, with a less distinct role, provides good support. Katy M. O’Brian and William Jackson Harper also score as characters we meet for the first time. Corey Stoll proves he’s a good sport in a surprising turn, and there are several fun cameos. Yes, there’s a mid-credits sequence that’s worth staying for, and a post-credits scene that’s even better. ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA doesn’t try to be profound or groundbreaking. It tries to be ingratiating, and it largely (apart from maybe a few too many punches and laser blasts) succeeds."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," The criticism of Marvel movies possessing a paint-by-numbers feel has existed for almost as long as the MCU itself. The idea that each superhero’s journey serves as little more than an Instagram filter over the exact same formula isn’t entirely unfair, but the MCU has generally managed to make up for its lack of originality with an abundance of charm. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a depressing case study of what happens to the whole enterprise when the same song and dance starts to lose its muster. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is one of the few surviving Avengers who actually seems to be enjoying life after the events of Endgame. Parlaying his fame into a successful memoir, Scott seems to have finally left his past behind, though his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton, the third actress to portray the character) worries that he may have lost sight of the needs of the world around him. Whether Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), now successful CEO of the Pym Foundation, agrees is largely unclear, since most people involved with making the film seem to have forgotten that the Wasp shares equal billing with Ant-Man, generally implying a sense of lead-character status. The film’s plot quickly is set in motion after Cassie and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), who the former now refers to as “grandpa” with absolutely zero explanation, craft a device that can communicate with the Quantum Realm, where Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) was famously trapped for thirty years. The idea that Scott too was trapped there after the events of the last Ant-Man film or that the space served as the main catalyst driving the events of Endgame is not deemed relevant to the plot. Naturally, a portal to the QR is a terrible idea, and the five find themselves sucked into a vortex, split up into two very convenient groups. Scott and Cassie get some space to work on their father/daughter bond, while Hope and her parents wander around looking for something that might resemble an interesting storyline. Director Peyton Reed never seems terribly interested in exploring his characters as people. Unfortunately, Quantumania can’t really explore the Quantum Realm either, not with the severely limited scope of its special effects department. Marvel’s laziest cinematography reduces the Quantum Realm to a monotonous green screen that looks to be about the size of an elementary school gymnasium, forcing all the actors to stand in place for almost the experience. Seasoned cinematographer William Pope recycles the same zoomed-in shot of the characters’ upper torsos again and again, presumably to clip coupons for the visual effects department. The color palette is bland and dreary, like a child cross-contaminated their Easter egg dyes, a tedious depressing eyesore. The performances are almost as lifeless as the CGI. Rudd, Douglas, Lilly, and newcomer Bill Murray all looked bored out of their minds, the latter as if he required a sedative to get through his scenes. If Murray agreed to shoot more than one take for any of his scenes, it certainly doesn’t come across in the final product. The jokes fall flat, with Rudd constantly betraying his complete awareness of what a disaster he’s starring in. Pfeiffer and Newton try their best to make the most of their character’s expanded roles, though their attempts to convey awe and wonder for the Quantum Realm fall flat in the incoherent narrative that moves swiftly through its 124-minute runtime, quite short by MCU standards. Quantumania suffers under some predictable hurdles that befall most third entries. The film already has too many characters within the Ant-Man family, on top of carrying the weight of a certain iconic villain in Marvel lore. Jonathan Majors makes his proper MCU debut as Kang the Conqueror after playing an alternate-timeline variant in Loki. Kang is supposed to be the MCU’s next Thanos-level threat, already announced as the villain of the next Avengers film set for release in 2025. Majors is always a joy to watch, but Quantumania is simply not a good outlet for his talents. Kang’s introduction is quite rushed, a reality of the film’s scattershot interests. Majors brings some depth to the lifeless experience, but his performance often serves to highlight the film’s abundant limitations. The plot grows exceedingly incoherent in the film’s third act, a narrative completely out of steam by the time Kang gets to do anything interesting. The film would have been much better off allowing secondary villain M.O.D.O.K., another iconic figure in Marvel lore, to slot in as the main antagonist, sparing Majors for a narrative that could bring some dignity to Kang as a character. It’s unclear how Marvel expects anyone to want more of Kang after this clownish endeavor. Quantumania represents an embarrassing low point for the MCU, a soulless cash-grab that debases the very idea of cinema itself. A just world would never allow the superhero genre to recover from such an artistically bankrupt abomination. This movie just doesn’t fail to give its audience a reason to care for its narrative, it makes you wonder why you ever cared in the first place. Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary! Ian talks about what she’s been up to this year, mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup. Life is a tricky game. Best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things. Thank you to everyone who’s listened to the show over the past half-decade! We don’t do as many new episodes as we used to, but it’s always fun to catch up. "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors is giving an emotionally acrobatic performance that this franchise does not deserve&#46;
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The storytelling&apos;s a bit unmoored&#44; but Paul Rudd shines in a colorful cantina of weird alien creatures and Jonathan Majors gives a charismatic pathos to Kang the Conqueror&#46; Isn&apos;t it nice to have MCU movies that are just plain fun again&#63;
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,I&#8217;d even call it good enough&#46; But it&#8217;s just sort of average &#8212; which&#44; for Marvel&#44; is decidedly below average&#46;
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," There was sporadic laughter and even occasional whoops of joy on Tuesday evening during the UK’s first public screening of Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania. So I concede that it may only have been the occupant of one seat (mine) in whom Marvel Fatigue took hold after barely five minutes. Marvel Fatigue is one of the great niggling oxymorons of our time. The blockbusters churned out by the Marvel Cinematic Universe are meant to propel us to the edge of those seats, exhilarated; not make us slump in them, defeated. And in fairness, some of them fulfil the brief. I got a genuine buzz from the first Ant-Man And The Wasp (2018), itself a sequel to 2015’s Ant-Man. One of the reasons for that was that it was largely earthbound. When it’s inventively written, the interaction between comic-book superheroes and the corporeal world can be a springboard for tremendous fun.  But here we get just a few promising minutes in San Francisco, where Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), whose alter ego is the Avenger known as Ant-Man, is flogging his autobiography — Look Out For The Little Guy — to an adoring public. Soon, alas, the narrative plunges us all into the Quantum Realm, an alien universe which, paradoxically, looks like every other alien universe invented by the movies. These places, meant to be so fantastical, have instead become dispiritingly familiar, always full of gelatinous blobs with wavy antennae, wisecracking like Greenwich Village stand-ups. Then there are the standard snail-camel hybrids, plodding along solemnly in the background; and at least one visual gag, in this case a character with broccoli for a head. ‘Holy ****, that guy looks like broccoli!’ says Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), cue obliging hoots at Cineworld, Leicester Square, from all but one vegetating critic. Hank and his daughter Hope, aka the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), are in the safe-ish hands of his wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who as you might be aware was trapped for 30 years in the Quantum Realm and knows her way about. Bill Murray pops up as a sly, velvet-suited fop still with a crush on her, but her chief adversary is Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who has captured Scott and teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) and is determined to get even with Janet for blocking his way out of the space-time continuum. I think that’s right. One can never be absolutely sure. Naturally, the special effects in Peyton Reed’s film are dazzling. But there is such a thing as too much dazzle, for which the best-known antidote is to shut your eyes. On the plus side, this is one of the shorter Marvel movies at just a whisker over two hours. And it does contain one wonderfully perceptive line from evil Kang, who observes that he can never tell one Avenger from another, that they ‘all blur the senses after a while’. I know just where he’s coming from. I know, too, where writer-director Florian Zeller is coming from, in following up his acclaimed 2020 film, The Father, with The Son. In The Father he tackled the gloomy subject of old-age dementia with terrific ingenuity, aided by an Oscar-winning performance from Sir Anthony Hopkins. This time, again adapting his own play for the screen, he addresses teenage mental health. The acting, once more, is first class, and the story is set up, as you’d expect from a fine playwright, with impressive economy. Peter Miller (Hugh Jackman) is a hotshot Manhattan lawyer, whose much younger second wife, Beth (Vanessa Kirby), has just had a baby. But there is a fragile ex-wife, Kate (Laura Dern) who is worried sick about their 17-year-old son Nicholas (Zen McGrath). The divorce hit Nicholas hard and appears to have triggered serious depression. The film never really escapes its theatrical roots, but the four principals do such a fine job that it doesn’t need to. There is also a cherishable cameo from Hopkins as Peter’s nasty old father, kindling the thought that maybe the ‘Son’ of the title is actually Peter, not Nicholas. It is simply unimaginable that in real life such well-heeled New Yorkers, for whom therapy is as much a staple of existence as the skinny soya decaf latte, would be so blindsided and befuddled by a depressive teen. Sharper, available to stream on Apple+ TV, explores that same gleaming Manhattan world, but from the perspective of clever con artists (played by Julianne Moore and Sebastian Stan, among others), not agonised parents.  British director Benjamin Caron has made a slickly watchable film divided into chapters, each focusing on different characters. But it’s 20 per cent too slick for its own good. The best screen scams and swindles — The Sting, The Grifters, Catch Me If You Can, Parasite — have a roguish charm that Sharper entirely lacks."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," De la frescura, la espontaneidad y la vocación de humildad a la solemnidad, la impostura de gravedad y las ínfulas de importancia. Ese ha sido el camino de la variante Ant-Man en el universo cinematográfico de Marvel. Y es una desgracia porque ni el personaje ni probablemente sus fanáticos merecían la abierta pomposidad y los excesos de dificultad de buena parte del relato de Ant-Man y la Avispa: Quantumanía, tercera entrega en solitario de las aventuras del hombre hormiga, continuación de las modestamente efervescentes Ant-Man (2015) y Ant-Man y la Avispa, olvidables, de efímero placer, pero simpáticas, todas dirigidas por Peyton Reed. La sensata percepción de ser un producto menor le había funcionado bien a Reed en las dos primeras películas. Sin embargo, ya en la segunda entrega una de las tramas se ponía demasiado afectada, como síntoma de estos tiempos hiperbólicos para cualquier chorrada, algo que se acrecienta de forma exponencial en Quantumanía. Si esa ampulosidad viniera de la mano del estilo visual, de la profundidad en la aventura o en el retrato de personajes, o incluso de las posibilidades metafísicas de la historia, al menos tendríamos sustancia que llevarnos a la mirada, al oído o a la psique. Pero no es así. De nuevo con vueltas y más revueltas al cansino tema del multiverso, la película, con ciertas líneas de comedia en medio del barullo existencial, y un par de secuencias a pie de calle, con el superhéroe lidiando con su propio ego con el tono de gracia irónica que no debería haber abandonado la serie, parece abotargada por la ambición. Visualmente solo tiene un momento de cierta expresividad, el prólogo, con el personaje de Michelle Pfeiffer caminando por texturas y colores que parecen extraídos de Noche estrellada, de Vincent van Gogh. Aunque, como contrapartida del hallazgo, se lleva la palma el risible diseño del rol de Corey Stoll, el supervillano M.O.D.O.K., que simplemente parece un rostro con la relación de aspecto errónea en el televisor o el ordenador. Mientras, si en las gotas de humor esporádico del guion lo mejor que se les ha ocurrido es organizar un chiste recurrente sobre el número de agujeros que tiene el cuerpo humano es que hay una carencia evidente de esa socarronería juguetona y familiar de las dos primeras entregas. Quantumanía, ambientada casi exclusivamente en el mundo cuántico, ese “lugar sin espacio ni tiempo que está debajo del nuestro”, lo que ya es definitorio, tiene que estar explicándose a sí misma todo el rato. Sobre aspectos del pasado de los personajes, sobre el funcionamiento de ese universo alternativo y sobre sus saltos temporales. Y la película nunca es compleja, únicamente complicada, que es muy diferente. El nuevo villano, Kang el Conquistador, adicto al monólogo altisonante, al que pone rostro de eterna tristeza Jonathan Majors, y que regresará en la nueva apuesta de Los vengadores, prevista para 2025, es aquí múltiple porque así es su naturaleza. Ahora bien, esa capacidad para multiplicarse está exenta de carisma. Una personalidad que sí tienen fuera de este despropósito algunas de sus estrellas, Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Bill Murray (ganándose un pastón poniendo su cara de siempre y lanzando un puñado de frases), al servicio de un vehículo al que le sentaba mucho mejor la insignificancia familiar que la desmesura cargante."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I returned from the journey to the Quantum Realm feeling less like a satisfied moviegoer than a traveler who had acquired another stamp on my Marvel passport. 
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," How long has Kevin Feige and the massive entity known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe been introducing us to the Multiverse? It seems like forever. Yet here we are again with “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania”, the first big Marvel production of the year and the 31st film in the MCU. Director Peyton Reed returns for his third Ant-Man film, although this one is more ambitious and has a significantly larger scope. Unfortunately that alone doesn’t equal a great movie. I guess it depends on who you talk to, but ever since 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame”, the MCU has been a frustrating and at times rudderless mess. It has nowhere near the flow or baked-in excitement since Thanos was defeated. Instead, Feige and company have over-extended into television, repackaged classic old characters, brought in a humdrum selection of new characters, and has spent more time introducing storylines than exploring them. Perhaps success has gone to their heads. Or maybe they’ve forgotten what made the early run so great. Admittedly, out of the early MCU, the Ant-Man films were among the weakest for me. I liked their smaller and more intimate scale. But neither the stories or the storytelling left much of an impression. “Quantumania” has much more on its plate. It’s supposedly the start of Phase 5 of the MCU although I quit trying to understand their “phases” years ago. Most of the cast returns including Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas. I say “most” of the cast because for some reason Feige recast Cassie Lang (Emma Fuhrmann was dropped and replaced by Kathryn Newton). This time the villain is Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a classic baddie in the comics who is still waiting to be adequately defined in the MCU. Those who watch Marvel’s assembly line of Disney+ shows first saw Kang in the first season of “Loki”. I was hoping “Quantumania” would give us a deep dive into the character, but sadly it doesn’t. Yes he gets some good screen time and we get to see him in action. Otherwise he only gives us vague allusions to grand ambitions and of “what’s to come”. As for Scott Lang (Rudd), aka Ant-Man, he’s been spending his post-Endgame days basking in the glory of his days as an Avenger. Hope (Lilly) is running things at the Pym van Dyne Foundation. Cassie is an activist who keeps winding up in jail. Janet (Pfeiffer) is holding onto secrets from the 30 years she spent trapped in the Quantum Realm. And Hank (Douglas) basically tags along and talks to ants. Scott and his family are sucked into the Quantum Realm after one of his daughter’s experiments goes haywire. The Quantum Realm is a CGI world full of wacky creatures, sentient walking buildings, and Bill Murray running around playing himself. It’s also a realm on the brink war as a rather bland tribe of freedom fighters led by Jentorra (Katy M. O’Brian) are rising up to fight the mighty Kang who has amassed a mighty techno-army. Scott just wants to get his family home. But Cassie believes they should get in the fight. So we get some manufactured tension between a conqueror and the people, and (on a smaller scale) between a father and his daughter.  But it’s hard to get too invested mainly because the movie barely goes skin deep. So much feels left out or underdeveloped. Kang is the best example. This should have been where we learned the most about him. Instead he just wants to leave the Quantum Realm. That’s it. He’s not into quelling the uprising. He barely seems aware they exist. He just wants to leave. His “powers” are never really explained, and even fans of the comics will have a hard time making sense of some of the things he does. And while the movie tries to make him menacing (in an almost Shakespearean way thanks to Majors), it lacks the edge to pull it off. Many of the problems can be traced back to screenwriter Jeff Loveness’ script. Taking on something this massive and expansive as your first feature film screenplay is a big ask, especially coming from writing for “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and doing a handful of “Rick and Morty” episodes. His story lacks depth, detail, emotion, and even laughs (the scattered attempts at humor fall flat). The dialogue goes from stiff to hammy, and all the quantumumbo-jumbo is never as interesting as it should be. But the biggest problem with “Quantumania” is that it just doesn’t move the needle in the MCU. Nothing about it feels special or even significant. And it certainly doesn’t feel as though it moves things forward. But it’s also short of its own personality and charm. The entire thing feels processed and churned out by the Marvel machine rather than creative minds.  I’ve came down pretty hard on the movie as if it’s terrible. It has a great cast, some of the visuals are actually quite striking. And then there’s M.O.D.O.K., a character I’ve always loved in the comics. The MCU’s origin of M.O.D.O.K. is utterly ridiculous. But once I got past that disappointment, he was actually one of my favorite things in the movie. Not because he’s a great character. But because he looks so hilariously bizarre, sometimes by design and sometimes due to crappy CGI.  But while “Quantumania” may not be terrible, it’s not memorable either. Kinda like the entire MCU since “Endgame”. This is another entry that fails to muster excitement or move things forward in a meaningful way. It just exists – a gear in a moneymaking machine that is starting to lose its steam. “Quantumania” will still make money. But even the most rabid loyalists are noticing the dips in quality and letting their voices be heard. And if the MCU loses them….. .  I’m going to see this tonight. It’s a shame this isn’t getting better reviews, but I’m not surprised. I think until Kang takes center stage, the MCU is going to struggle just because Infinity War/Endgame were so strong. I just want MCU to have the same energy as everything leading up to Endgame. These days I find myself watching just to watch. Back then my whole family was excited whenever an MCU came around.  Not so much these days. Keith, I agree with your review, except I wouldn’t have awarded it as many stars😀. What a mess. I feel guilty coming down as hard as I did on Strange’s “Multiverse Of Madness” and Thor’s “Love And Thunder.” It’s amazing to write but for me this was way worse than those two. Juvenile story and dialogue, and spending all of the film’s budget on CGI can’t gloss over those facts. Lazy, sloppy filmmaking as Marvel continues to display they have no interest in replicating the Avengers formula we came to love. Two hours later, you have a new villain whose main power looks to be being in every timeline. Not very scary, just inconvenient. That also sums up my feelings on seeing this movie. It’s such an unremarkable movie. Kinda like the MCU as a whole. I don’t know about this new batch of creatures. Nor am I convinced in Feige. There are a lot of factors, but the MCU has stalled. And this movie does nothing to get it moving again. Damn. I know I’ve been pretty much out on the consistent cadence of the MCU since Far From Home (the entertaining epilogue to Endgame, where things properly ended) as I’ve mentioned before; there’s just little that feels like event viewing, and the flooding of media—mostly TV, but some movies too, now makes it oddly daunting to stay interested. Too much to keep up with, particularly as most of it seems to fall in the painfully mediocre realm at best. You know more than me, but it even feels like the stars of these features look kind of worn down and not as immersed in their movies and characters.  I think this will probably be another MCU film I’ll watch when I decide to pay for Disney+ every year or so for a span of a few months. But yeah, I’ve definitely conceded now that when I watch these I’m gonna be out of the loop on so much lol. Shame, 2008-2019 was an impressive masterclass on how you build an interconnected universe. You nailed it, and I think your approach to these things is the better one. As I’ve mentioned, nothing about this movie feels significant. And I know what you mean about keeping up with everything. I couldn’t make it through the last three streaming shows and don’t find myself very excited about any of the upcoming MCU movies. Soooo different than how it once was. I noticed something that I feel into why this film didn’t work in comparison to the previous ones.  Ant-Man had four credited writers in Edgar Wright, Adam McKay, Joe Cornish, and Paul Rudd.  Rudd would return to help write Ant-Man and the Wasp with four different writers.  Now usually, a team of writers on something like this wouldn’t work but those films somehow did and they were totally enjoyable as I really loved the 2nd film a lot.  Plus, I think this film tried to take itself too seriously when it shouldn’t have been even though Kang is an absolute serious threat.  There was a lot of tonal imbalances within this film as if there’s going to be a fourth Ant-Man film.  No more Jeff Loveness.  Just get Paul Rudd and some writers to create something that is fun.  Plus, bring back Luis, Kirk, Dave, Cassie’s mom, and her stepdad.  Also give Agent Woo other than a 10-second cameo.  Here’s my full review.  I’m done."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," It’s where The Avengers went to time travel, where Janet Pym (Michelle Pfeiffer) was marooned for 30 years and where Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man rode out Armageddon. For those who had far better things to do, Michael Douglas’s Hank Pym (the original Ant-Man) provides a welcome early reminder. The third feature with Ant-Man in the title provides a deep dive into this subatomic world. Sadly, it’s not nearly as interesting as it sounds. Ant-Man (Rudd), his partner The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), his 18-year-old daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) and his in-laws (Pfeiffer and Douglas) are transported there when they stupidly gather round an experimental probe. They land in a CGI-heavy world which will remind you of Star Wars, Star Trek and maybe even Babylon 5. There are aliens (some reptilian, some a bit fish-faced, and one who looks like a stick of broccoli), a gang of plucky resistance fighters and even a cantina. The Darth Vader figure is Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) who’s being set up as the Big Baddie for the next “phase” of Marvel movies. I’ve no idea if there’s an official tie in but frequent, unduly prominent references leave the US ice cream chain the real conquerors of this “Quantum Realm”."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has been enjoying life since Endgame. He’s been dating Hope Van Dyne aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lily) whenever she’s not running her dad Henry Pym’s (Michael Douglas) old company, spending time with his young-adult daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) whenever she’s not fighting injustice, and peddling a new self-help autobiography. What he hasn’t been doing a lot of is Avengering, nor has anyone exactly been calling for his help. That opportunity presents itself when the aforementioned semi-dysfunctional family gets sucked into the Quantum Realm by an old nemesis that Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) has a prior undisclosed and ashamed history with… and he is less than happy with how things were left. Being director Peyton Reed’s third time out with Ant-Man and the gang, things were going to be a little different; it’s the first film of the MCU’s Phase 5, and the story seeds sown throughout Phase 4 are starting to take hold. The biggest has already been revealed in the Disney+ “Loki” series (some spoilers): He Who Remains aka Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors. The conclusion of that limited series made one thing very clear: the multiverse was being kept in check by the TVA (Time Variant Authority) by pruning branches from a predetermined timeline ensuring other Kangs could never rise to power. Once Pandora’s box was opened, being seen avoiding variant Kangs only draws attention from them, and they don’t miss much. The biggest question is, how screwed is the multiverse already? At a little over two hours, Quantumania throws a lot at its audience and fully expects it to keep up. The Quantum Realm itself is the Heavy Metal magazine-inspired acid trip one would expect, looking like the first cousin of the Dark Dimension occupied by Dormammu from the first Doctor Strange movie stocked with more creatures. Inspirations from Star Wars, Independence Day, and other sci-fi tent poles serve as production shortcuts, from faceless troopers to gathering armies. At any given moment, there’s a lot on the screen — perhaps too much, like a moving Where’s Waldo game trying to spot the heroes — with the same sense of whimsy that undercut Thor: Ragnarok but thankfully with more weight given to lives lost. Edited to the bone to avoid Eternals-like running time and over-exposition, Quantumania comes up short in emotion and extreme for spectacle. The impending dread of the ending won’t be what Ant-Man fans are expecting, but the MCU is betting big it’s what viewers need. Hey, at least it isn’t the Snyderverse, okay? Anyone trying to wrap their heads around this whole Kang thing and why it’s important: Kang is the MCU’s Rick Sanchez, the overconfident mad scientist of “Rick and Morty” but with a predisposition toward conquering everything he can; it’s no accident screenplay writer Jeff Loveness also wrote for “Rick and Morty.” If you understood that reference, picture the Council of Ricks, where the Ricks of every dimension gather to ensure no one Rick takes too much for themselves (read: assassinates other Ricks); violating that edict brings Seal Team Rick down upon them. So if Kang is Rick, who’s Morty? In what may be the kookiest idea the MCU has ever committed to screen, that role went to M.O.D.O.K., and don’t look up who the actor is if you don’t already know. At thirty-one films in and counting, the Marvel Cinematic Universe demands you keep up; it may all be connected, but it’s no longer intended for the casual moviegoer to take in a random Marvel movie. The excellent Jonathan Majors is the best reason to watch, his second MCU variant thus far with more to come; Michelle Pfeiffer reminds everyone she isn’t one for waiting around to be rescued. Everyone gets a moment to shine in the core cast, but the citizens of the realm are all one-note — revolution woman, torture guy, mind-reader man — mostly played for much-needed yet still throwaway laughs. For those who know they’re seeing Quantumania and those already done with the MCU, this review nor the film is going to change anyone’s mind. You’re either in or you’re out, and like its comic book origins, Marvel hopes your love of one beloved character or group will pave the way to see others as everything crosses. Quantumania may not be the best film in the series but neither is it the worst, and the fans already speculating where the films go from here means Marvel still has their attention."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," “The Real Me” is a track from “Quadrophenia”, which quasi-shares a connection to the third Ant-Man film, a movie that kicks off the MCU’s fifth phase.  The aforementioned lyrics almost describe the setting – the Quantum Realm – of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania”.  The locale is a bizarre spot, a micro-universe on a subatomic scale that resembles a twisty, disconnected topography of misshapen stalactites and stalagmites, gravity-defying land masses, and igneous rock formations delivered through a forced alliance between Dr. Seuss and the Krofft Brothers, Sid and Marty. It’s here that our heroes – Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), and her parents, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) – find themselves, in a “The Lorax” meets “Sigmund and the Sea Monsters” mash-up.  Even though the locale is a winding mess, the film’s plot is straightforward.  The Langs and Pyms/Van Dynes need to discover a way back to modern-day San Francisco while dodging a dastardly villain, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who rules over a great deal of these miniature, psychedelic beaches with thousands and thousands of Sneetches. So, director Peyton Reed – who has helmed all three Ant-Man flicks – pilots his leads and us into a Journey-to-the-Center-of-the-Earthish tale.  However, the film suffers from competing tones, subplots that spin in cul-de-sacs, and a physical environment with questionable personality, despite the painstaking detail exerted by the litany of digital artists that endlessly scroll during the ending credits.  Now, the first two Ant-Man flicks are pleasantly littered with humor, and Rudd – with his nice-guy, comedic background – fits into the role.  Both “Ant-Man” (2015) and “Ant-Man and the Wasp” (2018) carry low stakes, and even though lives were on the line (maybe?), these movies are remembered more for Scott Lang’s awkward journey to Ant-Man status and the progression of his relationship with Hope. However, Kang is the Big Bad in “Ant-Man 3”, and he’s apparently the long-term evildoer throughout the next MCU phase or two.  The man can deliver punishment, physically and psychologically, through off-the-chart weapons based on future technologies.  His array of armaments – which amounts to blue light emanating from his super suit – are, however, aren’t explained, so we never really know the extent of their destructive power or the length of his defenses.  This becomes a muddled problem in sizing up the chaotic confrontations over the 2nd and 3rd acts.  Still, he’s not afraid to lay waste to his enemies or slews of random innocents who stand at the wrong place and wrong…time.  He’s a vicious overlord, and Majors plays him with cool bravado, defiance, and menace.  Kang carries an element of an old-school James Bond-film antagonist and expends precious moments to explain his reprehensible plans, rather than just releasing the hounds…or sharks with lasers.  In this case, his figurative “hounds” or “sharks” would not only cause global catastrophes but universe-shaking ones. So, is Ant-Man, a hero who leans into jokes, an effective big-screen match for an existence-level threat?  That character-concoction works for the Guardians of the Galaxy, but here, our insect-referenced hero is outmatched, and as an audience, we need to cope with shifting tones between Lang’s levity and Kang’s murderous intentions.  Meanwhile, the film’s primary thread is Scott’s father-daughter relationship with Cassie, as Dad attempts to make up for lost years and trains his young protégé to be a superhero.  Naturally, Cassie soaks up the opportunity, and Reed and Newton often showcase the Young Lang’s “growing” pains of working with Pym particles (the sole basis for the Ant-Man technology).  Newton, 26 – who was terrific as a serial killer in the 2020 horror comedy “Freaky” – plays Cassie with the emotional maturity and general persona of a 15-year-old, and, hence, her frequent discoveries of new powers and battle tactics carry the theatrical weight of email spam. (As a side note, Cassie also – seems to – unnecessarily address her dad – with “Dad” – in conversation throughout the picture.  (i.e., “Why am I grounded?” versus “Why am I grounded, Dad?”)  So much so, that her utterances of “Dad” can become a distraction and a possible genesis for a college drinking game.  Please, as a warning, be responsible and assign a designated driver or call an Uber.) Kang has a devoted, insanely creepy-looking minion, a scoundrel that comic-book fans will instantly recognize.  For those unfamiliar with him, you will never unsee his presence, like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, but in a revolting, unpleasant way.  Large communities live in this beyond-microscopic land, and they probably have plenty of curious stories to tell.  Unfortunately, writer Jeff Loveness (or film editors Adam Gerstel and Laura Jennings) needed to devote more minutes – to the their tales – for audience-character connections to form and stick. Well, does “Ant-Man and the Wasp:  Quantumania” stick the landing?  That’s for you to judge, but this MCU movie is the beginning of Phase 5.  Enjoy or perhaps go home and find some 70s hits from The Who.  Maybe turn to “Who’s Next” (1971). "
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,While I had fun with this film&#44; I was disappointed&#46; That being said&#44; the movie is worth it just for Jonathan Majors&#46; 
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Expectation is an interesting thing. Going into a new Marvel movie that promises to kick off Phase Five and officially introduce the big bad of the entire “Multiverse Saga” is one thing. Seeing that same movie after the first round of critic screenings scored it as either the lowest or second lowest MCU movie — ever — is another. From this reviewer’s perspective, I can sum up “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” in one sentence: It’s “Ant-Man” if it was “Star Wars” written by one of the “Rick and Morty” writers during an off day. After a breezy first act that mostly exists to make fun of how smug Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has become after helping to save the world, the Ant family are sucked into the Quantum Realm, a microscopic pocket universe where the normal rules of space and time don’t exist. That includes Scott, along with Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Also joining them is Scott’s daughter, Cassie Lang, now played by Kathryn Newton (“Freaky”), who is officially the third actor to play the role. Scott has some prior experience in the Quantum Realm, but he’s completely unprepared for what he finds this time – a surreal and motley civilization of people and other beings straight out of the Mos Eisley cantina. Janet has also been there before, but she’s kept a huge secret from her family. When she was last stranded in the Quantum Realm, she nearly helped an evil multiversal traveler named Kang (Jonathan Majors, last seen in the “Loki” series) escape and unleash his wrath upon all of existence. Instead, she trapped Kang there, and he was forced to settle for conquering the realm and biding his time. Marvel newcomer Jeff Loveness (“Rick and Morty”) penned the script, which makes sense given all the bonkers creatures and bending of space and time. What’s most surprising, however, is that many of the comedic moments just don’t land. Rudd is always funny and always game, and Douglas gets a few good chuckles with his grave, gravely deadpan. But the big laughs are few and far between. On the other hand, it’s a welcome surprise that this movie looks fantastic. Reed previously served up two average “Ant-Man” movies that weren’t terribly big in terms of scale and mostly took place in sunny California. “Quantumania” in part evokes “Star Wars” because the visuals are so often breathtaking. This might be the best-looking Marvel movie since “Avengers: Endgame.” Credit Reed and the VFX team for pulling out all the stops. Among the smaller roles, Bill Murray is shockingly forgettable as Lord Krylar, a former love interest of Janet. William Jackson Harper (“The Good Place”), on the other hand, is a welcome addition as the psychic being Quaz, and he gets some of the biggest laughs. The end result is a movie that’s just OK. Pfeiffer feels strangely flat and often must deliver some eye-rolling exposition. And much of the writing is just plain dumb. The same can also be said of vintage “Rick and Morty,” but that approach works a little better as a 22-minute animated TV show. The two-hour runtime of “Quantumania” doesn’t exactly drag, but it’s just so uneven. It’s gorgeous to look at one moment, and then M.O.D.O.K. roles in and looks … unsettlingly weird. Or Majors puts on an acting clinic as a Marvel villain for the ages, and then the frenetic pacing grinds to a halt because of sloppy exposition. The movie is partially saved by a genuinely thrilling ending, followed by an unsettling post credit scene that won’t be spoiled here. But where “Quantumania” could have been a real game changer that restored the momentum, fun, and emotional depth that peaked with “Endgame,” it ultimately feels more like a trailer for what’s coming next and less like the latest MCU classic. "
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," While family is still the heart and soul of Peyton Reed’s third Ant-Man film, Quantumania breaks from tradition and delivers a decidedly Star Wars-infused story, complete with alien-filled cantinas, sand speeders, and the sort of “rise against our oppressor” messaging that is often lost within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Likewise, if you grew up loving the Spy Kids movies, then there’s every chance that you will love what Quantumania is putting down with its villainous designs and comedic beats. Everything from the design of MODOK (Corey Stoll) to the heroic ants to the jokes about holes and dicks and the central focus on family—it screams mid-aughts in the best of ways. This blend of narrative influence and visual design makes Quantumania one of the better films to arrive since the start of Phase Four.  Majors was already a stand-out performer from Marvel’s Phase Four, after his magnetic performance in the final act of Loki, but Quantumania allowed him to explore another side of the many, many Kangs that exist within the multiverse. This Kang is decidedly duplicitous as he plays upon the sympathies of Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) as a lost soul, all the while planning to become a cruel, tyrannical ruler. The contrast between these two personas is sharp and tantalizing to watch unfold. This Kang is so casually cruel and calculated in every way, and Majors’ performance lures you in with practiced ease, making you want to root for him even though he is, without a doubt, a true villain.  Pfeiffer is another powerhouse in Quantumania, which shouldn’t actually come as a surprise. While Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) may be the reason why their family ends up trapped in the Quantum Realm, Janet is the reason why the Quantum Realm is in such disarray. The film opens on a flashback to when Janet was stuck in the Quantum Realm for thirty years and reveals that she saved Kang’s life when his ship crash-landed there, but it takes almost the entirety of the first two acts to return to this flashback and explore what really happened. What is revealed could have benefited from longer scenes, rather than the cliff notes version presented. In this case, brevity is not the soul of wit—especially not when Majors and Pfeiffer are electric on screen together, acting circles around each other, and outshining almost all of their co-stars. Even Michael Douglas and Bill Murray.  The film may be titled Ant-Man and the Wasp, but Ant-Man and the Wasp (Evangeline Lily) often feel like background characters in their own film, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Rudd is still largely front-and-center, especially as he’s fighting to save his daughter’s life from Kang, but Cassie eclipses both of them as the most interesting character. Cassie is cut from the exact same cloth as her father, though she hasn’t been changed by Avengers-level heroics or book deals. She is focused on helping the less fortunate, even if that means getting thrown into jail—both in the real world and the Quantum Realm. Her plotline and evolution as a hero in her own right will likely leave audiences jonesing to see her team up with the other under-30 Marvel heroines like Yelena (Florence Pugh), Kate (Hailee Steinfeld), Kamala (Iman Vellani), America (Xochitl Gomez) and Maya (Alaqua Cox).  Despite the current critical response of Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, it’s not actually a bad movie and it’s far from becoming the worst film they have ever put out. The plot line is tighter and far more cohesive than The Eternals, and it was able to create well-rounded characters, despite having a crowded cast list. The out-of-this-world visuals of the Quantum Realm are eye-catching and fun, and genuinely some of the best CGI and VFX work since the start of Phase Four. It isn’t a visual slog like the cacophony of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and it doesn’t treat its female characters as over-emotional menaces who are unworthy of agency. Quantumania leaves you feeling excited, hopeful, and energized about where Phase Five is headed—especially if it means Kang is going to be at the forefront of the chaos that’s yet to come.  Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is one of the best MCU films in recent history because it doesn’t take itself so seriously. It delivers fun, light-hearted, and sometimes juvenile humor all the while delivering weighty plotlines and exceptional performances. While Paul Rudd will always be Ant-Man, the final chapter in his trilogy sets the stage for Cassie Lang to eclipse him as a superhero to rally around. Despite its minor structural issues—which is owed to the fact that it holds back a hand that the audience already knows is at play—Quantumania seizes on an aspect of comic book storytelling that is often overlooked in a world filled with grimdark tales: fun. "
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania feels less like it&#8217;s a small part of a bigger plan and more as if it&#8217;s being forced to work against its own interests to serve a grand design&#46;
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," The third Ant-Man movie opens in a world that has seemingly gone back to normal after the events of The Blip (when Thanos snapped everyone out of existence, before the pandemic). Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has written a memoir, Look Out for the Little Guy, in addition to his podcast referenced in the Ms. Marvel series, talking about how he went from prison to being an Avenger. He is on good terms with his partner, Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and her parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). His biggest problem is while he is taking a break from heroics, his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) is running headfirst into trying to use Pym technology for good, like getting in between the cops and a homeless encampment. This comes at the encouragement from the Pym/van Dyne side of the family.  The cool fights aren’t the reason superheroes are popular, it’s the characters. “Dinner table scenes,” like the one early in this film, are as important to the genre as the costumes. Seeing these characters as fully realized, with particular relationship dynamics gives the conflict, and the all important overcoming the odds for a climactic triumph, meaning. These scenes are some of the highlights of recent Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies like Black Widow, Shang-Chi, and The Eternals. The Fast franchise also understands it, which is why those movies typically end with one. Cassie calls the elder Ant-Man “Grandpa Hank” and honestly, it would have taken a lot to make me dislike Quantumania after that. I’m a sucker for found family stories, and the way Ant-Man has built one over these movies is one of the sub-franchises’ best features. If the entire movie had been about their family unit and the dynamics with it, even without superheroics, I would have been happy. But of course, as the trailers promises, this is a very different Ant-Man movie in terms of scope. While both previous entries had featured the Quantum Realm as either a Checov’s gun or a MacGuffin, this third story makes it the setting for most of the runtime. Functionally, the Quantum Realm acts like any sort of science fiction setting, like a planet that is really chaotic and has blobby terrain. It’s mostly not terribly fun to look at, but it allows the Ant-Family to get their own kind of road trip, even if the geography falls into an uncanny valley of not being concrete enough to track how the locations connect and not being psychedelic enough to lean into the potential for kaleidoscoping visuals. What results is taking a lot of beats from other space adventure stories. There’s been a lot of Star Wars comparisons floating around, but I think those do this movie a disservice, since this is much more like Flash Gordon, with a ‘regular guy’ brought into a strange world that is big on colorful costumes and light on actual worldbuilding. But at least this story’s version of Ming the Merciless is worth the messiness around him. While in the Quantum Realm, Janet reveals the reason she never talked about her experiences there before was her friendship with Kang (Jonathan Majors), a multiversal traveler also stranded there. While trapped, he has since conquered much of the known areas of this dimension, building a citadel at its center and preparing an army to bring even more worlds under his control. Jonathan Majors made his debut as a version of Kang named He Who Remains in the Loki series, a weary and bored incarnation of the character. Here, Kang is a calm exterior layering over a feral anger at the entire multiverse. I first noticed Majors in The Last Black Man in San Francisco, and he’s been great in everything I’ve seen since, especially Devotion, and I can’t wait to see him in Magazine Dreams from this year’s Sundance. In the comics, Kang is a character who shows up in different flavors across time and the multiverse, which should give Majors a chance to essentially play different villains almost every time he appears.  While the entirety of Quantumania is briskly paced, the second act still feels somewhat inert as the focus is pulled towards setting up the third act and much of the character work feels basic. However, the finale is one of Marvel’s better efforts, with the final confrontation using the clear emotional stakes as a reason to give the acting out of the conflict a few different phases that make great use of these particular characters and their powers. There are some great moments I won’t spoil, and a surprisingly cogent take on one of Marvel’s more oddball characters. Aside from family, the biggest thematic concern is that of collectivism overcoming dictatorship. Kang the Conqueror is a self-styled Alexander the Great, wanting to expand and control his empire. The way that the nature of ants are used as a counterexample is fun and somewhat clever, but also neatly links Cassie and Hanks’ anti-police stance from our world into the Quantum Realm.  The Ant-Man characters have always deserved better movies. The cast is so charming and fun (I truly love what Michael Douglas has brought to Hank Pym in particular), yet the series shines more in individual moments than it does in overall story. This one in particular, pushing forward the far-reaching cosmic inventiveness of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee more towards the center of the MCU. Kirby and Lee excelled at inventing entire worlds and memorable characters from whole cloth, and later artists and writers have developed them further and combined them in endless ways to tell new stories with these building blocks. Quantumania feels like pulling a random comic book from a box and going along for the ride. It’s not pushing the form further or playing with genre, but it is a fun adventure with great characters. "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Director Peyton Reed’s style and sensibility really matches up well with the third “Ant-Man” movie series, a franchise that’s been a lot about an underdog hero. In a world where he’s even second to Spider-Man, a fellow under dog superhero, it’s interesting to see how “Quantumania” depicts the idea of family and how dads can be all the heroes we need when all is said and done. Deep down, “Quantumania” is a movie about family, about the unconventional family unit and how it works in a world that they’re woefully unprepared for. Super-Hero partners Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope’s parents Janet van Dyne and Hank Pym, and Scott’s daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible. The dynamic between Douglas, Pfeiffer, Lily, and Rudd is still as great as ever with the foursome representing the legacy and future of the Marvel universe. I’m especially happy that they’ve somewhat loosened their grip of Hank Pym, and allowed him to become a quasi-Ant-Man for the film series. While it’s been gradual, Michael Douglas fits well in to the skin of Pym, working as a great mentor alongside Michelle Pfeiffer who seems to be having a blast in the role of the OG Wasp. Kathryn Newton is also very good in the role of Scott’s daughter, a teen girl who is ambitious to a fault and seems to be skyrocketing as a superhero that Scott still aspires toward. Much of “Quantumania” is a fun and exciting ode to films like “Fantastic Voyage” where we’re given a glimpse in to the world within our world. Peyton Reed doesn’t waste too much time, for exploring the dynamic of these characters after the last film, and how they have to come together once they’re all hopelessly lost in the Quantum Realm. There aren’t a ton of Easter Eggs to the Marvel Universe, but “Quantumania” does spend a lot of time setting up the future films, and our current big bad: Kang the Conqueror. Sadly, that works to a fault, as Reed spends almost too much time setting up future storylines. Rather than emphasizing the stakes of our current predicament, there’s far too much propping up of future films and the future “The Avengers” film. As well, there’s a ton of call backs to Marvel web series which, if like me, you haven’t seen, won’t mean very much when all is said and done. There just aren’t enough stakes punctuated to make Kang feel like a legitimate threat to our world quiet yet. And that’s a shame, considering Jonathan Majors is very good in the role of Kang. There’s so much imagination and creative twists behind “Quatumania” nevertheless. I loved a lot of the monsters and their introductions in to this narrative, as well as the way we leave the film on ellipses. I quite enjoyed the absolutely phantasmagorical action of “Quantumania,” but like “Iron Man 2,” it would work so much better if it didn’t feel like a simple buffer before we get to the more urgent affairs with the Avengers."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," It’s not a secret that I am a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I’ve caught every film and most of the TV shows that Marvel Studios considers canon. For a long time, I’ve pushed aside the arguments made that the franchise is getting old or that the MCU is too prolific. It wasn’t something I personally felt. However, now that the MCU has officially kicked off Phase Five with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, I’m forced to re-examine things and possibly concede that yes, we might need a break. In the years since he helped save the world in Avengers: Endgame, Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has become a successful author thanks to his best-selling memoir. Hope Van Dyne/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) has taken over Pym Industries, using its technology to help people the world over. Scott’s teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has developed a machine that can send and receive signals from the Quantum Realm, but when a demonstration goes haywire she, Scott, Hope, and Hope’s parents end up sucked into the Quantum Realm where they must contend with the exiled conqueror Kang (Jonathan Majors), who sees Pym technology as his way out.  The previous Ant-Man films have been a source of respite for the MCU. Largely skewing away from high-stakes drama, leaning into more down-to-earth and practical challenges (at least relative to the rest of the MCU). Ant-Man and the Wasp generally didn’t go up against world-threatening supervillains. You didn’t see an ominous skybeam by act three. It allowed the films to inject a needed dose of levity into the proceedings, and the films executed a well-balanced mix of superhero action and a clever wit that often bordered on the absurd. That balance has been well and truly disrupted with Quantumania. The trickster charm that made the previous films so appealing has been drowned in a vat of MCU formula, emerging as just another stepping stone forward for the all-consuming metaplot. The humor is still here, but it doesn’t hit nearly as hard as before, and there are very long stretches of the film that are nothing but random action scenes and heavy drama. It’s by far the darkest and most serious mood the Ant-Man films have had yet. Is that such a bad thing? Yes and no, but leaning toward yes. On the one hand, it is nice to see Scott Lang and company rise to the occasion of the other Avengers and take on threats far beyond their scope. On the other, it also feels like they’re way out of their league because the MCU’s version of Ant-Man is not a cosmic hero. While the Quantum Realm is a hidden universe underneath our own, it essentially constitutes an alien galaxy, a setting that would seem better suited for heroes like Thor or Captain Marvel. The glimpses we’ve seen of the Quantum Realm before barely resemble the full, industrial world-building on display here.  To be fair, the Quantum Realm does look amazing. It’s a psychedelic kaleidoscope of colors and shapes where buildings are alive and creatures with energy cannons for heads are common. There isn’t really much internal logic to the place, but as it exists outside space and time, that can be forgiven to an extent. Director Peyton Reed definitely has his visuals working, and they pair beautifully with Christophe Beck’s elevated score. However, I’m not going to extend the same leniency to the loose, sloppy story. To say the film has pacing issues is a massive understatement. The script by Jeff Loveness has a wildly uneven application of rising action, and in some ways, the film feels like three episodes of a Marvel TV series stitched together at the last minute. A set piece involving Scott being trapped in a “probability storm” and surrounded by hundreds of variants of himself feels like it should be a third act climactic moment, but it’s placed in the second act and followed by a long, drawn-out battle between our heroes, Kang, and an uprising of the people he’s oppressed. At 124 minutes this film is toward the shorter end of MCU run times, but it still feels like a good 15 minutes should have been excised.  And here’s the worst part about that battle: it’s just way, way too hard to care about it. While the film tries to position the political situation in the Quantum Realm in the broader context of the MCU (that is, Kang can’t be allowed to escape or he might conquer the whole timeline), it’s ultimately difficult to give a damn. A number of new characters are introduced that we will likely never see again, many of them adaptations from a highly obscure Marvel Comics supporting cast (and one memorable character who’s completely and totally wasted here). Why are we spending so much time with these extras? It really emphasizes the idea that this film exists only to introduce Kang, since he’s going to be the new Big Bad for the current Multiverse Saga.  And while Kang is a poorly-written character with basic villain motivations, he still comes alive with Jonathan Majors’ performance. We’d previously seen Majors play a variant of Kang called He Who Remains on the Loki TV series, where he was surprisingly genial and pleasantly world-weary. Kang here is a straight up, old-fashioned tyrant, and his personality couldn’t be more different. However, Majors jumps into him with serious dedication, imbuing Kang with a dangerous, almost magnetic charm that’s nowhere in the script. Even in Marvel Comics, Kang isn’t the most iconic or complicated antagonist; he’s basically the Big Bad because of his longevity and because Marvel had only just acquired the rights to Doctor Doom when the film was written. But in Majors’ hands, Kang emerges as a genuine threat, a real, calculated terror that promises to rival the MCU’s Thanos in scope and totality. Like Majors, our band of heroes does a great job with the material, elevating it far higher than it ever could go on its own. The cast literally keeps the film moving even during the times when the narrative grinds to a complete halt. Paul Rudd continues to be one of the most charismatic actors in the MCU, and here he gets to discover new, darker sides to Scott Lang that were only hinted at before. While Evangeline Lilly gets mostly sidelined here, she still makes Hope Van Dyne a welcome presence, even if she sports one of the most hateful haircuts in superhero film history. (It’s allegedly an homage to The Wasp’s iconic pixie cut in the comics, but I can’t get over how awful it looks on Lilly in live action. I’m petty. Sue me.) Scott spends most of his screen time with Kathryn Newton, and while Newton seems a bit shaky at times, she’s hard to dislike, and she’s very enthusiastic whenever she’s on screen. The film’s most under-utilized character, however, is Michelle Pfeiffer’s Janet Van Dyne. Pfeiffer is a phenomenal actress. This has been well-documented. She looks absolutely amazing, her legendary beauty making it almost impossible not to get drawn into her. However, she’s given the wholly unpleasant task of shouldering a ton of the film’s exposition and retconning. It turns out Janet got up to a lot of shenanigans during her 30 years in the Quantum Realm that she conveniently never told anyone about. For all of Pfeiffer’s inherent allure, she often seems like carrying the narrative backstory is an unpleasant task for her. It’s a great thing that she’s finally allowed to be a vital character in the MCU, but it’s also unfortunate that she doesn’t seem like she’s having a great time being in this specific spotlight. But even this is better than no Pfeiffer at all, and I have to admit that I paid more attention to the film when she was on screen. When all was said and done, I walked away from Quantumania feeling unsatisfied. This definitely an “I’m still f**king hungry” moment. This feels like filler. Empty calories. Something pleasant, even exciting in the moment, but ultimately lacking in substance. If not for a dedicated and highly professional cast, it’s possible this film may have gotten lost inside the relentless cogs of the MCU machine. It feels odd that the thing that gives me hope for the rest of Phase Five is its villain, but this is where we’re at. It’s truly a strange universe, indeed."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Ready for a big movie with a tiny hero? Phase 5 of the long-­running Marvel Cinematic Universe begins with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. The franchise is heading toward a massive multi­versal war scheduled to take place a few years from now, but this movie gives us a preview of the big baddie, Kang the Conqueror. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania begins with Ant-Man Scott Lang (once again played by the eminently likable Paul Rudd) settling into his new life after helping save half the universe in Avengers: Endgame. The littlest Avenger has become a minor celebrity in his neighborhood, but he’s still struggling to make up for the five years he lost with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) during the Infinity War. Cassie, for her part, has started using Ant-Man’s shrinking technology to become something of an activist. Cassie has also been working with Scott’s girlfriend Hope (Evangeline Lilly), aka The Wasp, and Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to study the quantum realm—the timey-wimey space beneath our universe where Scott was stuck for five years. But the person who knows the most about the quantum realm is Hope’s mother Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who spent decades down there and refuses to talk about what she experienced. What they find is an entire micro universe complete with myriad strange sentient beings. The quantum realm feels like a cross between Star Wars and Avatar—everything has an organic galactic texture. But this colorful sub-cosmos is ruled by the oppressive Kang (Jonathan Majors)—an evil tyrant who needs Scott’s help to escape the subatomic universe so he can get back to wreaking havoc in the multiverse. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania offers audiences an enjoyable adventure with fun characters. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas give solid enough performances. Douglas looks like he’s ­having a good time. But Jonathan Majors as Kang is the highlight. Majors imbues the character with a mix of weariness and menace, and his Kang possesses a restrained physicality. The best superhero stories involve villains with an interesting justification for their villainy. Kang is a villain who’s primarily at war with himself, which, to my mind, qualifies as interesting. The script doesn’t break much new ground with its somewhat formulaic plot about outsiders showing up to free people from oppression. The movie tries to weave in some themes of family conflict. Scott tries to understand Cassie’s youthful enthusiasm for getting involved. Cassie can’t understand why her father wants to play it safe. Janet keeps secrets for no apparent reason, which causes Hope pain. The message: Family members need to trust each other. But the stakes to these conflicts are pretty small, which keeps the audience from being invested. Despite the return of director Peyton Reed, Quantumania abandons the heist genre that made the earlier Ant-Man films feel different from generic superhero movies. This movie pays lip service to that heritage, but it’s more of a space-­opera action comedy. Quantumania pushes us further into Marvel’s new multiverse arc. Also, I keenly felt the absence of Michael Peña, who played a scene-stealing ex-con in those earlier films. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania doesn’t feel like an Ant-Man movie, but there’s still plenty of fun to be had. The movie has sweeping computer-generated imagery, quirky new characters (I was pleased to see William Jackson Harper make an appearance), and an old-fashioned triumph of good over evil. It’s not a complicated or challenging film. It’s a crowd-pleasing popcorn flick that stays in its lane. Collin is WORLD’s arts and culture editor.

"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," A portion of Film Twitter was atwitter the other day because a brave individual logged on to inform all the haters that superhero movies are Good, Actually. Indeed, beyond being Good, Actually, the “superhero movie” is so good that it isn’t even definable. It transcends mere genre. The superhero movie is cinema itself, a restatement of archetypal notions of good and evil. In this telling, the superhero movie isn’t a cinematic boot stamping on the human face, forever: It is the human face, in all its complexity, in all its glory. Perhaps. But would it be too much to ask the superhero movie to make it look as though its heroes are actually, you know, walking in a real place and throwing real punches and stomping on real human faces? This is just one of the thoughts that strolled lazily through my mind while watching Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. This complaint is neither original nor will it likely be compelling to the genre’s legion of fans, but there’s something so incredibly hollow about the entirety of the quantum realm in which much of the action takes place. Yes, I understand that Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) are in a strange world with all sorts of weird, unnatural sights and colors and sounds and creatures, but that doesn’t change the fact that they look like they’re walking on oddly rendered clouds rather than solid ground and working against flat surfaces with computer generated backgrounds behind them where the shadows are all badly off. The problem isn’t so much that the quantum realm looks unreal; it’s more that it looks unrealized, unfinished. Digital doodles. And this is the problem with dismissing criticisms of “superhero movies” as philistinic contrarianism. Because we all know what we’re talking about when we talk about “superhero movies.” It’s not the presence of superheroes that rankles. It’s the weightless CGI action. It’s the way everything is so obviously shot against a greenscreen and nobody has bothered to match the light sources to give half an illusion of depth. It’s the way the actors deliver dialogue without masks and then as soon as an action scene begins a CGI face covering snaps into place so doubles—either digital or of the human stunt variety—can work their magic before the masks slide back up again and Rudd (or Lilly or whoever) can fire off another quip before we rinse and repeat. It’s the whole MCU aesthetic, in other words. And while that aesthetic still can work—it worked fine in Shang-Chi and Spider-Man: No Way Home, and Sam Raimi was able to bend it to his will in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, imbuing that film with just enough style to annoy fans of the series—when it doesn’t work the seams really show. The seams showed badly in Thor: Love and Thunder, a near-parody of the Marvel aesthetic. And Black Panther: Wakanda Forever looked as though it was half done, particularly in the scenes that took place underwater, especially in comparison to the vastly superior Avatar: The Way of Water, released just weeks later. It doesn’t help that Kang (Jonathan Majors), the villain not only of this film but the “phase” of the Marvel movies to come, is weirdly unimposing. For a guy who can eliminate whole timelines, his powers seem entirely dependent on whatever the script needs him to be doing, as if they’re the inverse of “plot armor.” One second he’s firing blue rays out of his hands that are sublimating faceless hordes from solid into gas, the next he’s … in a fistfight with our leads. Why not just turn them into gas, too? I dunno, great question. But then, I don’t understand much at all about what Marvel is doing with Kang, who has been killed at the end of two different Marvel properties, first on the Disney+ show Loki and now here. One of the small pleasures of the early Marvel movies was the idea of Thanos as a presence looming somewhere in the background, working on an ominous master plan that seemed to be growing ever closer; Kang’s appearances thus far have made him feel small, slight. Don’t worry, though: The credits are kind enough to inform us that Kang will return to stamp on our face at some point in the future, though likely not forever."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania wants to psych you up about the launch of ""Phase Five"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a corporate entity that's now 15 years old and starting to look a little winded. Phase Five will naturally be a multimedia delivery system, hauling out the third Guardians of the Galaxy movie, a pair of sequels (Captain Marvel, Captain America), and a bunch of Disney+ TV stuff. Let the endless cross-promoting begin. But not yet. The first two Ant-Man movies derived most of their charm from Paul Rudd, whose small-scale, nice-guy warmth in the role of Scott Lang/Ant-Man was a welcome downshift from Marvel's usual action-fantasy megalomania. Unfortunately, Rudd is swamped by this third film, which is a boiling neon tsunami of towering blob creatures, walking broccoli stalks, big chrome spiders, Avatar-style hanging sky islands, and much, much more, quite a bit of it either on fire or in the process of being detonated at any given moment. The story, such as it is, begins in Scott's native San Francisco, where we see that his daughter, aspiring Ant-Teenager Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), is embarked on a personal project to remotely map the mysterious Quantum Realm (QR)—a subatomic dimension that exists ""outside of time and space,"" as they say. The QR is ""a secret universe,"" according to Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), the original Wasp, who was held captive there for 30 years. Janet, the wife of Scott's mentor, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), who was the original Ant-Man, is horrified to learn that Cassie has established a connection with the Realm, since any such link could easily become a bridge—and sure enough [cue calamity]. Most of the movie plays out in the QR, unfortunately. The overstuffed retro artiness with which this world is rendered suggests a trove of classic sci-fi magazine covers that have been scissored into doilies and then run through a computer. This eventually grows tedious. Janet and Hank are here along with their daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lilly), the current Wasp and still Scott's love interest. As anyone will know who felt their brain sliding sideways while watching last year's Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, an anything-goes setting like the QR is a frustrating environment in which to attempt to tell a story. There's liable to be more than one version of the characters pinballing around, and here there's also a madly multiplying ""probability storm"" to create new kinds of confusion (in a funny scene in which Scott faces off against his many selves). The movie barely has a story to tell (what there is of it is credited to Rick and Morty veteran Jeff Loveness), but returning director Peyton Reed can't keep it from sprawling anyway. The characters run around the Quantum Realm trying to escape, and a smooth-talking brute called Kang the Conqueror tries to stop them. Kang, who's played by Jonathan Majors, of The Last Black Man in San Francisco, is a worthy inheritor of the Big Badness once provided by the now-departed Thanos. Kang's problem—well, his enemies' problem—is that he can see the end of everything in advance. He knows how every conflict will turn out, and one can imagine that this allows him to plan surprises accordingly. He also collects time, or something, and can hand out spare wads of it as party favors. Majors brings a dark force to this seductive character, and he makes the movie a little more interesting whenever he rises up to say things like, ""I don't live in a straight line."" But the most interesting thing in this oddly uncompelling picture is a quick scene in the end credits in which we get a dark, tantalizing look at things to come. It lasts maybe a minute or two, but it oozes atmosphere. Too bad that when everybody got together to make this picture, they didn't just go ahead and make that one instead.

"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," After viewing the latest rendition of the “Ant-Man” series, “Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantamania” starring the familiarly jovial Paul Rudd, I felt compelled to write my review as a letter to you both as well as director Peyton Reed. Each year, I subject myself to countless Marvel and DC movies, most of which blur together no matter the Universe.  The storylines are all much the same; good guys fight (and fight and fight) the evil bad guy who is set on destroying the world(s).  But there was always something different about “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Shazam” (the one with Zachary Levi, not The Rock), and “Ant-Man.”  I actually look forward to these iterations of the commonplace super hero movies and now, “Quantamania” has fallen prey to these other formulaic, dull and predictable big budget movies. What happened to the subplots?  You remember them, the side stories of interest where we get to know the ancillary characters and their quirky backgrounds.  For example, Luis (Michael Pena) who made us laugh as he recalled “Drunk History” style his antics with our still rough around the edges Ant-Man aka Scott Lang.  Or Darren’s (Corey Stoll) complicated background which led him to his life of evil.  And then there was the effervescent Judy Greer as Maggie, the frustrated ex-wife with her current hubby Paxton (Bobby Cannavale) who added grit and humor to the storyline. It pains me to say that your script becomes stereotypical; blending into all the other super hero movies that relentlessly hit the screen each and every year.  You’ve even created a “Thanos” type of character in  “Kang The Conqueror” (Jonathan Majors) who, in all honesty, was the most interesting character of them all as we learned about his past endeavors and conquests in this tiny world.  But, alas, it’s not enough."

"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," Do you suffer from multiverse fatigue? Do you long for the days when just one verse was enough? Do you shrink from another trip into a quantum realm of substandard digital effects? If so, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,"" now in theaters and likely to dominate this Presidents Day holiday box office, won't heal your pain. Not even close. Despite the presence of the insanely likable Paul Rudd as the mini hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the powerhouse impact of Jonathan Majors as the villainous Kang the Conqueror -- move over Thanos -- the third go-round for Ant-Man is more of the same to dwindling effect. It's also the kickoff for Phase 5 of the MCU, which doesn't augur well. That's surprising since the first two Ant-Man movies, in 2015 and 2018, were notable for their becoming modesty as the bratty, playful runts of the Marvel litter. In short, Ant-Man reveled in staying small. No more. Even at two hours -- a blink compared to typical Avengers epics -- this one feels uncharacteristically bloated. Rudd is back as Scott Lang, the petty thief transformed into the crime-fighting Ant-Man. After he helped save the world in ""Avengers: Endgame,"" Scott is enjoying his newfound celebrity as the bestselling author of ""Look Out for the Little Guy."" He's also raising his teen daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) with the help of girlfriend Hope (Evangeline Lilly), aka The Wasp, and her parents Hank (Michael Douglas), the original Ant-Man, and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who's just back after 30 years of captivity in the Quantum Realm. A setup for dufus domesticity? Hardly. Returning director Peyton Reed, working from a script by Jeff Loveness, has bigger goals than fun. It turns out that Cassie, with a little boost from Hank, has found a way to make contact with the Quantum Realm. Janet is understandably furious. But before you can say ""plot contrivance,"" the whole family is zapped into fresh Quantum hell. For a while, as we see the family join the resistance to Kang and his plan for world dominance, excitement holds sway. The sinking feeling sets in when we realize that ""Ant-Man"" has nothing to say that Thanos didn't think of already. Bathroom jokes try to pass as genuine humor as a pink, oozing alien asks a human, ""How many holes do you have?"" Despite the mood-breaking nonsense, the actors give their all, especially Pfeiffer, whose Janet holds the key to the master plan of Kang, recently featured on ""Loki."" Majors (""Da 5 Bloods,"" ""Lovecraft Country"") gives his dictator a gravity that seems at odds with the goofball frivolity around him. Expect serious deviltry from the K-Man in future Marvel epics. The bad news is that the rest of this Ant-Man huffs and puffs and quickly blows down a house of cliched cards built on copycat special effects -- think the globby creatures from the cantina scene in ""Star Wars"" -- and miniaturizing tricks that soon wear out their welcome. Everything from ""Dune"" to ""Spaceballs"" is saluted and ripped off. In all the fuss -- there's a bizarro cameo from Bill Murray as Lord Kylar -- we don't just loose track of the characters, we stop caring about them. That's a disaster for any disaster movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Down, down, down to the Quantum Realm ye' go. Marvel Studios is back with their latest, the 31st MCU movie to date so far (with more on the way later this year), yet another sequel - Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. While it technically is a sequel to Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) continuing the storyline following Paul Rudd as Scott Lang as the superhero known as Ant-Man, it really is more of an introduction to ""Phase Five"" of the MCU. It's a huge step forward, or a giant step down into the tiniest of realms. As the title indicates, this is all about ""Quantumania"" - taking us down to the Quantum Realm, and exploring the inhabitants of this entirely different, strange and unusual world while following the Pym Family and their attempts to escape and return to, well, the ""regular-sized"" Earth realm. This truly is the MCU's Star Wars, featuring some spectacularly trippy visuals, turning this sequel into the movie I really wanted to see with the disappointing Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Although the script still is the weakest link. With this many movies in the MCU so far, we all know what to expect with the Marvel formula. The biggest difference this time is that director Peyton Reed, who directed the first two Ant-Man movies, went on to work on directing episodes of Disney+'s Star Wars series ""The Mandalorian"" inbetween Wasp (2018) and this movie. That experience working in The Volume has certainly paid off, giving him a different edge this time around, allowing him to expand on the visuals and the epic world-creation in Quantumania. This is a place we have never been before. I just wish the script was as good as everything else. Credited to writer Jeff Loveness, the Quantumania script is generic and mostly stale in its pre-packaged story of the Pym Family. Filled with all the usual platitudes about his daughter and his family, whether it's ""all about her"" and saving her, or bringing the family back together. It's a visually spectacular world with a mesmerizing villain, strung along with generic, uninspired plodding for the main Pym Family characters. Yes, we get it, Scott really loves his daughter Cassie and does everything for her. Does he ever think about anything else…? I guess not. There are a few aspects of Loveness' script that do work well, however, mainly involving the villain Kang The Conqueror, played by the extraordinary Jonathan Majors. As we all know, the villain in superhero movies has to be as complex and as intelligent as every other main character, or it's all for nothing, the rest of the movie falls apart. They've certainly figured this out already, especially with the ""bad guys"" from the Black Panther movies. Playing off the original introduction of ""He Who Remains"" from the end of the First Season of the Loki series on Disney+, Majors returns to play an alternate version of the character (a variant!) - a being known as the formidable ""Kang The Conqueror"". His story, how it connects to the Pym Family, and how it plays out over the course of this movie, is the most compelling part of the screenplay. Loveness, who also worked on ""Rick and Morty"" as a writer, brings in some of that ""Rick and Morty"" space spice to crank this up a few notches with some wildly imaginative only-in-the-Quantum-Realm twists & turns. This is what I wanted to see more of, mainly with the rest of the Pyms, but Marvel really can't shake things up too much. Nonetheless, it's pretty much an objective truth that Jonathan Majors is a God amongst men - and a key reason why Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is worth watching. He's just so damn good, bringing his intensely charismatic, complex emotions to this trippy story of Realms and Multiverses and Variants. We're deep into Multiverse territory now, which has a whole other set of implications that this movie does not explore, but nonetheless it does make the stakes for this particular -Verse interesting. Majors has a, ahem, major role to play in the MCU after being introduced in ""Loki"" and this is an extension of that role, though more of a re-introduction, establishing some rules and concepts that future MCU movies might play with. I just love that they found and cast Majors in this role, as it's not an easy role to handle, with so much going on, and I think he's so damn alluring and so damn devious yet so damn charming that it's near impossible not to like him. Even though he's the villain, that appeal is exactly what makes him so wicked. Watch out for this guy. If you're bored of all the MCU movies, you won't be bored by Jonathan Majors, I'll say that much. Everyone else in Quantumania is pretty much the same MCU character we've seen already, with serviceable performances, except for Michelle Pfeiffer as the other stand out. Pfeiffer's Janet Van Dyne was sucked into and trapped in the Quantum Realm during the events of Ant-Man and the Wasp until she was rescued. But what happened there was a big mystery until it's revealed in this movie. While it's all a bit obvious, it is ultimately an important part of the plot, as she was an important part of the QR before departing. Most people don't seem to miss her down there, which is a bit strange, but this is the Star Wars-esque epicness of this whole other universe. It's full of tons of characters, factions, entire armies and legions, with a revolution brewing much like in the early Star Wars movies, and time moves at a different speed. Marvel found a safe space to tell this kind of story because the QR exists separately from Earth-616 and everything else that has happened in the other 30 MCU movies. Though with Kang, there is a connection that will expand beyond the QR back into other realms and  worlds and this is the big ""what's coming next"" tease with Quantumania."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," Following a rocky fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the third instalment of the Paul Rudd-fronted Ant-Man is officially kicking off phase five(!) with another jam-packed and ‘game-changing’ slate in tow. While the third instalment of a franchise is often a tricky beast to tackle, the latest Marvel Studios film is also burdened with (perhaps not so) glorious purpose – proving the connecting tissue to set up the next big bad of the cinematic universe. Much like the third instalment of the Captain America franchise isn’t truly an out-and-out Captain America film, Ant-Man 3 similarly falls into that category. While the film opens with plenty of fun family hijinks and the usual charming humour (bar Luis – we miss you Luis!), screenwriter Jeff Loveness quickly forgoes this setup to establish the scenario that there’s a greater threat afoot.  Queue plenty of laboured “he is coming” and “did she not tell you about HIM” foreshadowing peppered throughout – up until the big reveal – which is intrinsically tied with the much-teased reveal of Janet van Dyne’s time in the quantum realm. Unfortunately Scott and the family dynamic play second fiddle to introducing Kang the Conqueror following that surprise reveal at the end Loki, resulting in an outing which is clearly more interested in setting up the stage – and major pieces – for the next big saga. And it’s a shame, really.  The end product is certainly a tale of two halves, complete with a distinctly mixed tone. While the main narrative is much more concerned with the seriousness of Kang’s escape plans – and the potentially seismic implications this could have on the multiverse – it’s weirdly juxtaposed with a particular brand of goofy humour and the exploration of the bonkers Kirby-esque Quantum Realm. At times it is fun, with a psychedelic, old school sci-fi adventure vibe throughout – think Star Wars meets The Fifth Element. But overall, while some parts work, others really just don’t. The humour feels very much in line with Thor: Love and Thunder and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, with a screenplay full of quips such as “it’s never too late to stop being a dick!”, “ants don’t give up” and “I have holes!” (no, seriously). And the less said about MODOK the better, frankly. Individual charisma and chemistry between actors certainly elevates the material, with a number of genuine emotional moments and standout performances carrying the film. Firstly, this instalment proves that this is Jonathan Majors’ world and we’re all just living in it. His turn as Kang the Conqueror is undoubtedly captivating, with a surprisingly quiet stillness combined with true physicality and gritty animosity. While his ultimate goal and motivations are kept closely guarded behind an almost unreadable face, he is a surprisingly intimidating force who truly commands the screen. His delivery of “have I killed you before?” certainly exudes an exciting menace that we haven’t seen since Thanos terrorised the MCU. Michelle Pfeiffer also does a lot of the heavy lifting with an excellent turn as Janet van Dyne, as we finally delve into her time trapped in the Quantum Realm. In fact, the best scenes in the film are the more quieter moments exploring the complicated dynamic between Jane and Kang, in an almost ‘what could have been’ type scenario. Similarly, Rudd also excels alongside Majors in a surprisingly dramatic turn for the beloved comedic actor, proving he’s just as heroic as the superheroes he’s long looked up to and admired. “I don’t have to win…we both just have to lose” certainly is one of the more impactful lines of the film. However, while Rudd and Newton share a sweet dynamic throughout, Lilly and Douglas somewhat fall to the wayside. There’s still a weird lack of chemistry between Rudd and Lilly (especially considering Rudd is one of the most charismatic actors ever), and Douglas just looks tired of acting in front of a green screen while delivering silly lines. In going big with Kang, Ant-Man has lost it’s family-centric charm. Still, the surreal and trippy Quantum Realm makes for an entertaining sandbox to play in, with plenty of Kirby-esque outlandish alien species (including a broccoli headed individual with plenty of creepy eyes) and environments to explore. There’s also a few imaginative set-pieces, with standouts including a trippy and hilarious “probability storm” action sequence, along with a thrilling – if slightly chaotic – climactic battle which fully utilises the switch between small, medium and large scale Ant-Man/Wasp and Cassie. However, this is undoubtedly another effects driven MCU outing with endless amounts of green screen and volume backgrounds. At times, the environments are reminiscent of the Spy Kids or Star Wars prequel trilogy, coupled with terribly lit sequences which unnecessarily darken things once again. Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania is overall, a pretty mixed bag – with Peyton Reed torn between committing to the franchises’ fun, family-focused hijinks exploring the wacky Quantum realm or setting up the bigger, Kang shaped multiversal stakes for future instalments. Excellent performances from Majors, Pfeiffer and Rudd aside, this third instalment certainly feels destined to be in service of the larger cogs of the MCU rather than a worthy story in its own right.

"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania movie review: This film's redeeming qualities lie solely in the efforts of its cast, who have done their utmost with the subpar material provided, and the skilled VFX artists responsible for its visual appeal. Reflecting upon what the film would have been like had it not been for the likes of Rudd and Jonathan Majors is a dreadful thought. Ant-Man 3 movie review: The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a behemoth that appears to be too big to fail. Despite proclamations by Kevin Feige and others overseeing this interconnected film franchise, the Marvel formula has remained mostly consistent, with a few notable exceptions. But clearly, it still works. Even the less exciting installments, like the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the 31st film in this juggernaut of a franchise, are met with raucous laughter and cheers every few minutes. While watching the movie in the theater, it seemed like the audience was primed to erupt with laughter at even the slightest hint of a joke. It has become a routine almost, a thing one just has to do. Me? If you have read anything I have written about Marvel in recent times, you would know I got disillusioned long before Thanos faced the Avengers. Marvel formula bores me out of my mind. There are, of course, benefits of a shared universe from a storytelling point of view. The sandbox allows the writers to create exciting, interconnected stories and explore the more interesting supporting characters further through spinoffs movies or TV shows. The world feels richer, complex, and lived-in when you spot hints of other characters while watching a movie or show unrelated to them. That sense of unity and shared continuity is what comic-book companies have cashed in on for decades. But then, there are pitfalls as well. The tone largely has to stay the same. Feige and his team have to make sure the scribes understand the connections between the characters. And this breeds mediocrity of relying upon callbacks, cameos, and Easter eggs. It's not as though I completely abhor those. I began reading comics before I was 10 and have not stopped. I think I never will. I love all references to other stuff, but in moderation. Even as just a consumer of these stories, I understand they cannot collectively serve as an alternative to a well-crafted story, engaging dialogue, and fully-realised characters.  But since this is the almighty formula and this is what fans of these movies expect, the people in charge of the MCU have no choice but to cater to those expectations.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has Scott Lang, his daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank Pym (Michael Pfeiffer) getting stranded in the Quantum Realm, the weird but wonderful pocket subatomic universe which resembles popular science-fiction depictions of alien worlds. It even has its own aliens — humanoids with monstrous beasts, creatures wholly made of goop, and human-looking people wearing clothing straight out of Mad Max movies.  Oh, and there is an Immortan Joe equivalent as well. Kang the Conqueror is one of Marvel Comics' most popular supervillains, and for good reason. He presents a challenge to the Marvel heroes that is unique in itself. He is a conqueror, but not of land, at least in the lore. Instead, his domains are temporal. He is not all-powerful, but has technology, mind, and will at his disposal that is far superior to any superhero alone. Jonathan Majors plays Kang as somebody truly desperate but will never let it show on his face. He hides devilish intelligence beneath a reasonable, mild-mannered demeanour. ""Just give me this, and I will give you that in return,"" he says, straight-faced (paraphrased to protect spoilers, of course). But Majors is nuanced enough to make that statement give an edge. It is a full-bodied performance that makes the movie less of a chore.  Rudd is reliably charming, making nonsensical lines funnier than they have any right to be. Newton is good too, though in a movie supposedly about a father-daughter relationship she is not given much to do. Pfeiffer's character is given more room, which is welcome, and Douglas and a couple of cameos are amusing enough.  If you can't tell already, Quantumania is an absolute dud. I felt bad for genuinely great actors that populate this thing for having to mouth lines that might as well have come out from that AI thingy everyone these days seems so fond of. The script is, and I cannot stress this enough, execrable. The screenwriter behind this film is Jeff Loveness and that should frighten you. For he is also writing the next Avengers movie, The Kang Dynasty. MCU is certainly not getting any better soon. Everything that is good about Quantumania is due to the actors doing their very best considering the material they are saddled with and talented VFX artists making the film visually pretty if nothing else. I dared to imagine what the movie would have been like if nor for Rudd, Jonathan Majors, and others in the cast... and I would not want to live in that timeline. This is bad enough. The script tries to instill a little goofiness à la Thor: Ragnarok, but it too feels forced, like it was just a half-hearted attempt to fit the movie in the mould of the 'delightfully deranged' side of MCU.  If you are a typical MCU fan, you will probably not share my opinion. I realised that by watching the movie with a crowd screaming at the most quotidian moments like it was Rapture. And that's okay. I won't begrudge it if people find escape and enjoyment for a couple of hours and forget their worldly troubles. I have to suffer through these movies these days only because they are popular, alas, and it's my job. "
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is in a good place, his newly published book on his Avenger exploits rejuvenating goodwill for him in his San Francisco neighborhood.  But his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) thinks he’s coasting on his laurels instead of helping people while her recent arrest at a peaceful protest has him in denial about his little girl growing up.  Granddad Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) is all too happy to mentor, though, but while her subatomic telescope into the Quantum Realm is impressive, the signal it sends is exploited to suck the whole family along with Hank’s ants back to the place Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) is terrified of returning to in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is in a good place, his newly published book on his Avenger exploits rejuvenating goodwill for him in his San Francisco neighborhood.  But his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) thinks he’s coasting on his laurels instead of helping people while her recent arrest at a peaceful protest has him in denial about his little girl growing up.  Granddad Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) is all too happy to mentor, though, but while her subatomic telescope into the Quantum Realm is impressive, the signal it sends is exploited to suck the whole family along with Hank’s ants back to the place Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) is terrified of returning to in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Director Peyton Reed (""Down with Love,"" ""Ant-Man"") returns to his corner of the MCU, this time to kick off Phase 5 and the villain, Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors, containing multitudes), who dominates the Multiverse.  Reed and writers Jack Kirby (""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"") and ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live's’ Jeff Loveness maintain the humor that defines this subseries and while the film is laden with a new purpose and a new world that marks this one something like the extended Lang family visits Disney’s “Strange World” by way of “Star Wars,” it is more entertaining than its predecessor (“Ant-Man and the Wasp”). 
While Hope Van Dyne (aka Wasp, Evangeline Lily) and her dad are along for the ride, the story dynamics are mainly between Scott and his daughter and Janet and Kang, one of many secrets she’s kept from her family about her decades caught in the Quantum Realm.  The film actually begins with a flashback that shows Janet on her homestead in the Realm, complete with horse-like creatures with snail heads, being attacked by creatures that fragment into two.  She’s suddenly assisted by a stranger who claims to have crash-landed, but as we will learn, his seeming benign nature will be unmasked when she gets a glimpse of his brain while fixing his neuro-kinetic ship and sacrifices everything to keep him stranded.
Hope and her parents are separated from Scott and Cassie, each group going off on separate adventures but both learning that the name Janet is recognized everywhere and for very different reasons.  Scott and Cassie cause trouble for the QR’s Jentorra (Katy M. O'Brian) by drawing Kang’s interest in the form of his stormtrooper-like soldiers and his hunting killing machine M.O.D.O.K. (Corey Stoll), none other than Darren Cross (aka Yellowjacket) now looking like evil Humpty Dumpty.  Hank is in for a surprise by the insinuations of Janet’s ‘old friend’ Krylar (Bill Murray), but she’s in for more of a shock to learn he’s switched allegiances.  The ensuing bar fight will be amusingly capped off when Hope pulls a fast one enlarging an appetizer.  Of course, they’ll all be reunited, including Hank’s ants, for a climactic MCU battle royale, Cassie’s heroic instincts now as great an asset as her smart-assery (‘It’s never too late not to be a dick.’) 
There were umpteen special effects houses employed on this film and the Quantum Realm is more organic than one might expect, boasting all manner of fauna and flora.  One of the film’s best new creatures is Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), two eyes on pink stalks inside a glass dome fascinated by the fact that humans have ‘holes’ and the seeming shape spec for Jentorra’s spaceships.  But while the effects are notable, so too is the end of Rudd’s claim to never-aging fame, the actor now appearing recognizably middle-aged. Director Peyton Reed (""Down with Love,"" ""Ant-Man"") returns to his corner of the MCU, this time to kick off Phase 5 and the villain, Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors, containing multitudes), who dominates the Multiverse.  Reed and writers Jack Kirby (""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"") and ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live's’ Jeff Loveness maintain the humor that defines this subseries and while the film is laden with a new purpose and a new world that marks this one something like the extended Lang family visits Disney’s “Strange World” by way of “Star Wars,” it is more entertaining than its predecessor (“Ant-Man and the Wasp”).  While Hope Van Dyne (aka Wasp, Evangeline Lily) and her dad are along for the ride, the story dynamics are mainly between Scott and his daughter and Janet and Kang, one of many secrets she’s kept from her family about her decades caught in the Quantum Realm.  The film actually begins with a flashback that shows Janet on her homestead in the Realm, complete with horse-like creatures with snail heads, being attacked by creatures that fragment into two.  She’s suddenly assisted by a stranger who claims to have crash-landed, but as we will learn, his seeming benign nature will be unmasked when she gets a glimpse of his brain while fixing his neuro-kinetic ship and sacrifices everything to keep him stranded.

Now, Lang and company go back to the Realm for new adventures, including doing battle with Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.”
This latest entry into the Marvel Comics Universe marks the jump-off point for phase 5 of the MCU. (Whatever that means.) To me, “Quantumania” is just a continuation of the “Marvel thing” that began with “Thor” and “Iron Man.” Since then, there have been, I am guessing, dozens of entries into that universe and the result is one of diminishing returns.
There is a mechanical nuts and bolts purpose to this “further adventures of Ant-Man and his friends.” But, there is a lack of artistry and story in favor of bombastic F/X, lots of flashing lights and a whole bundle of monsters, Quantum People fighting for their existence and a bad Bad Guy named Kang.
Of course, the adventurers – Scott, Hope, Hank and Janet – must fight for their lives (sort of, though I never felt they were in any real danger of being perished). Peyton Reed returns to direct his third installment of the Ant-Man saga and it seems that Scott’s amiable good nature that made the character so likable is now overshadowed by the noise of the F/X. Story does not seem to matter anymore in the MCU.
Usually, when I have to sit through yet another Marvel movie, I can expect a couple of things. There is a 20 or so minute finale that throws the kitchen sink at you in an F/X extravaganza, 10 minutes of credits and one or two under the credits stingers. But, there is a difference with “Quantumania.” The expected bombastic ending is over thirty minutes long and is only that – bombastic.
At best, the Ant-Man entries should really be about 90 minutes long, have more humor and less kitchen sink being thrown at me. I can tell the MCU creators are running out of ideas. There is one scene when our stalwart heroes enter a bar in the Quantum Realm and it felt, suspiciously, like a similar scene from the first “Star Wars” movie but with a bigger budget. reviously, Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and her family opened a tunnel to the Quantum Realm to find Hank Pym’s (Michael Douglas) long lost wife, Janet (Michel Pfeiffer).

"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is, at its best, a travelogue of a failed family vacation. Early into the picture, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) inadvertently drags her loved ones – parents Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne (Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, our title duo), and maternal grandparents Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne (Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer, returning as the original Ant-Man and Wasp) – on an unexpected, subatomic getaway to the Ninth Rung of Disney Hell. The official name of their destination is the Quantum Realm, the nadir of popcorn filmgoing. This is where our eyeballs and brains, as audience-members, pay penance for the MCU’s ongoing embrace of dark and muddy CGI and VFX.  In Quantumania, young Cassie realizes her grandmother’s worst nightmare: reentering an infinitesimal and dangerous world, far beyond human experience, where existence hangs in the balance. In the theater, we realize Martin Scorsese’s worst nightmare: reentering the treadmill of tired, franchise filmmaking, a substitute for episodic television, where boffo box-office receipts beget sequel upon sequel upon sequel, almost biblically.  The third Ant-Man movie, again helmed by director Peyton Reed, only offers more ammunition for Scorsese, and the MCU haters of the world. I, by no means, am a Marvel skeptic. Even the second entry in this particular series once stood apart from the pack – genuinely comedic, light as air. Quantumania, on the other hand, grinds its gears against future Phase Five installments, another MCU cog that can’t spin independently. Though it has moments of levity, most of its (blessedly short-ish) runtime merely sets up upcoming Avengers extravaganzas. Two are forthcoming. They’ll be Earth-shattering, no doubt. What is Quantumania about? Well, I was told no spoilers could be revealed until later this month. But intrepid fans have probably figured out that the announcement of Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror, two-plus years ago, as the villain of this movie, means the third Ant-Man episode is merely an origin story for our new Thanos. He, by the way, is electric, even if Kang’s motives seem generic, even for a comic book antagonist.  A lot of world-saving heroics happen in the Quantum Realm by our vastly outmatched family. Yet the action set-pieces here are mostly confounding in execution, if not outright mind-numbing. All of Quantumania is a set-up for the next thing. The Big Bad arrives and, after a political uprising occurs, he’s briefly thwarted. Kang probably survives another day, to create future havoc. This, mind you, isn’t a spoiler. At last year’s San Diego Comic-Con, the title of an upcoming Avengers movie was announced: The Kang Dynasty. Could our next great supervillain, maybe, be Kang the Conqueror? Uh, yeah. No shit, Sherlock. "
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is the third stand-alone Ant-Man movie featuring our size-shifting Avenger hero, played by Kansas City’s own Paul Rudd. Evangeline Lily, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas reprise their roles from the previous “Ant-Man” entry. Ant-Man and his crew inadvertently shrink to the quantum realm only to discover that it looks just like a planet from a Star Wars movie. While the tone of this goofy entry is all over the place, it does introduce Jonathan Majors as the menacing super villain Kang the Conqueror…and he nails it. Otherwise, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is just another overly busy Marvel extravaganza. The Apple TV+ psychological thriller “Sharper” is a twisty drama that will keep you guessing. Julianne Moore and Sebastian Stan lead a strong cast in this intricately structured tale about con artists working to fleece a billionaire, played by John Lithgow. But who’s conning whom? Don’t think too hard about the details because they don’t quite hold up to post-movie scrutiny. But “Sharper” still provides a lot of decadent fun while you’re watching it. Given its title, you’d think that the midnight horror movie “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey” would at least have some camp value. Nope. This micro-budget slasher movie is a witless “Halloween” rip-off with Pooh and Piglet responsible for the bloody mayhem instead of Michael Meyers. Pooh indeed.

"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Whatever you may think of the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#44; the ability to tell a good story with amazing special effects and spectacular costumes is first and foremost an essential part of the process&#46; 
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,ANT-MAN AND THE WASP&#58; QUANTUMANIA is a showcase for visual effects and that&#8217;s about it&#46;&#10;This looks like another franchise that has worn out its welcome&#46; 
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," Out of all the superheroes in the MCU Ant-Man has always been the most fun partly due to the comedic genius that is Paul Rudd. Ant-Man is also more relatable compared to the other superheroes. Scott Lang is an everyday man.  Another nice thing about Antman is just the idea that his powers are derived from Ants and science instead of him having actual powers per se. Ant-Man works best when it leans into its silliness instead of trying to be intellectual.  Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania is a bit more serious than the previous films. This time, the film takes a page from STAR WARS, with the majority of the action taking place in an alternate universe rather than the real world. This can be perplexing at times, but there are parts where it works. His family has also grown. Hope/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), her father Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Hank's wife scientist Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) are all enjoying each other and catching up on lost time. Cassie (Kathryn Newton) joins them in this new euphoria, having grown up around superheroes/scientists and naturally wanting to follow in their footsteps. Cassie's decision to explore the Quantum Realm sets things in motion, resulting in a new set of problems. The family now finds itself in the Quantum Realm trying to find their way home. This provides a new set of challenges and new enemies.  As if the region's rough terrain and bizarre vegetation and scenery weren't enough, it also has some very strange residents. Kang (Jonathan Majors), the new supervillain, is both a terrifying dictator and a comical extraterrestrial species. Rudd is hilarious as Anti-hero-hero Lang/Ant-Man. He's the reason we agreed to go on this crazy ride. We like how Lang has matured into a full adult while still grappling with his super hero status. As serious as Quantumania attempts to be, his scenes are some of the most enjoyable due to the humor. Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays scientist Janet van Dyne, is the film's other standout. She's a lot of fun. Pfeiffer, who is usually cast in dramatic parts, proves she can do comedy as well. It's great to see that, at age 64, she can still kick butt and succeed. Douglas is also fantastic in his role as Dr. Pym. Another pleasant surprise in the film is the return of Corey Stoll in a new role. Everything comes together after seeing the film. Kathryn Newtown, as adult Cassie, clearly understood the mission and adds to the wackiness that is the Lang family. For many expecting Lilly to be center stage as the Wasp, well her role has been reduced in this outing but she still gets to be part of the epic battle in the end.  There can't be a hero without a villain in Marvel, and Jonathan Majors as Kang lives up to the hype. He's impressive and provides the necessary seriousness to balance out Rudd's humor.  Considering how different this film is from the first two Ant-Man movies, many people probably won't like Ant-Man and the Wasp: QuantumMania as much as they did the other Marvel Cinematic Universe films. This is also the start of the MCU's next epic turn. Marvel enjoys time lapses and having their heroes band together to save the universe, and this film mission will help set the tone. The challenge for Marvel and Kevin Feige is that the expectations for these films are so high that many fans are left feeling confused, but if they go in understanding that these films are escapism and just one crazy fun ride, everything will be fine."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," What I’ve always loved about the “Ant-Man” movies, aside from the ever-lovable Paul Rudd in the title role, is the slightly hand-made quality, in contrast to the high-tech, hight-gloss, high-CGI aesthetic of the rest of the MCU. The opening of the second film in the series sets the tone. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), under house arrest following the parole violation of saving the world with the Avengers, has created a cardboard thrill ride for his daughter, Cassie. The Ant-Man series had some goofy humor with Scott’s relationship with his ex-wife (Judy Greer) and her new husband (Bobby Cannavale), the cop who can’t decide whether to arrest him or befriend him (Randall Park), and with the discursive stories from his friend and colleague Luis (Michael Peña). The production design truly set the stage with more lived-in spaces than in the other Marvel movies.  Not so much this time. Of course, this is a Marvel movie and there are imaginative and exciting action sequences, especially as Scott develops his use of his powers. It has a nice mix of comedy and action, with characters we are invested in, not just as individuals but in the way they are connected to each other.  As the title tells us, this movie takes place in the least hand-made setting imaginable, the quantum realm. As wonderfully imaginative as it is, suggesting a mash-up of Alice in Wonderland, the Pastoral Symphony section of Disney’s “Fantasia,” the wildest anime creatures of Hayao Miyazaki, and video games like Minecraft and No Man’s Sky, plus last year’s “Strange World,” there is a pristine quality that removes much of the distinctive charm we expect from Ant-Man. Plus, talk about the forest and the trees. There is just so much detail here, with the endless settings and characters so overwhelming that they make it hard to keep track of what is going on. It’s not enough that a character’s head looks like a stalk of broccoli. Someone has to say, “His head looks like broccoli.” And then we don’t have much to do with him again. There’s a lot to see and much of it is enticing, but not enough of it relates to anything that relates to the stakes, the abilities or vulnerabilities of the good guys or characteristics that would help us understand who they are and how they behave. The issue of understanding each others’ language is handled briskly but other properties are not developed or explored.  The title says it all because the story is more about the place than about what happens there. After a brief prologue, with John Sebastian’s theme from “Welcome Back, Kotter” on the soundtrack, we hear from Scott about how lucky he feels. He is an Avenger, universally loved for saving the world, even if that means people always ask him for photos (with their dogs!) and they don’t always remember which insect superhero he is. His daughter is doing well, he and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) are happily in love and she is out saving the world with wonderful programs to help people who need housing or other kinds of support. Scott has written a new book about his life, and enjoys appearing at book-readings.  But it turns out Cassie (Kathryn Newton of “Freaky,” excellent in the role) has been stirring up trouble by appearing at protests and experimenting with a probe into the quantum realm. Before Janet (Michele Pfeiffer), who spent 30 years there and has refused to give any details, can stop her, Scott, Casssie, Hope, Janet, and Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) are all sucked into the quantum realm, and that is where they stay for almost all of the rest of the film. There is a long stretch where we meet an assortment of colorful characters. Some of them are fun, including a goofy return from one of the earlier films. It is always good to see William Jackson Harper (“The Good Place”) as a frustrated telepath who is way over hearing all of the disgusting thoughts of everyone around him and a jell-o-like character very interested in how many “holes” humanoids have in their bodies and what goes into and out of them. A major star appears for a few minutes for no real purpose.  As I have often said, superhero movies rise and fall on the quality of the bad guy, who has to be evil enough to be a serious threat but not omni-powerful enough to make it impossible to defeat him. With Thanos gone, the Marvel character Kang the Conqueror has been refashioned in his image. Free of the reality-based limits of time and space, Kang’s calculus about wiping out whole universes is for him just straightening the pictures on the wall — except that it turns out there is a strong element of revenge behind his decisions about who and what needs to be wiped out. “There’s always room to grow,” Scott tells his readers, and those reassuring words come back to inspire the good guys later on. But in this case, taking Ant-Man out of the smaller world of the first two films shows that all that room may not be what this story needs."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is an odd film, and not because most of it takes place in a dimension outside space and time. Director Peyton Reed’s movie continues the lighthearted-comedy streak of the previous two entries yet simultaneously attempts to instill very dramatic stakes. The setting is a dazzling new land full of weird creatures, yet none of it is especially spectacular, and while the quips come fast and the story is always moving, every minute of its two-hour runtime is felt. The third “Ant-Man” installment certainly has some winning elements, including strong performances, a couple of cool designs, solid jokes and more, but it feels like it’s doing too much while trying to tackle something far too big. Following the events of “Avengers: Endgame,” Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is doing pretty great. He saved the world, still has his girlfriend Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and gets love from everyone around him. One area that could use a bit more work is his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who constantly finds herself in trouble with the law for her crusading acts of social justice. Lang soon discovers that she’s not just causing trouble with the cops but also conducting quantum experiments with Hope’s father (Michael Douglas). When the group, including Hope’s mother (Michelle Pfeiffer), are sucked into the Quantum Realm, they find themselves in a bizarre new world. They also find that they’re in the crosshairs of the Realm’s ruler, a ruthless man named Kang (Jonathan Majors). The first two “Ant-Man” movies were relatively small affairs. They had lots of fun miniaturization moments and excellent humor, but the stories themselves were much more contained than other MCU efforts. The first “Ant-Man” was a super-powered heist movie, while the second was a super-powered McGuffin chase. They were light-hearted and soared on the charisma of its leading actors and the banter among them. “Quantumania” tries to retain that spirit and approach while expanding to a much broader story scale — one that includes grander action sequences, a world-ending threat of a villain, more dramatic beats and a lot of worldbuilding. It’s like injecting “Ocean’s Eleven” into “Avatar,” and while there are moments and aspects that work well, the final product feels uneven and awkward. The Quantum Realm is a totally alien place made of alien organisms and bizarre landscapes, but due to the CGI or color schemes used, it never feels wondrous. This should be an amazing spectacle for both the cast and the audience, as we’re seeing a whole world that we didn’t know existed on a scale that we couldn’t imagine. That’s a tall order, of course, but that’s the one that writer Jeff Loveness, Reed and the rest of the team took on with this movie. There are some excellent alien creatures in design and execution, and some cool practical costuming, but most of it feels alternatively muted or too busy and blends into an easy-to-ignore background. The humor is still strong, with Rudd leading the way as the hapless Lang, who’s in way over his head. There’s a truly hilarious scene towards the end of the film that plays in a beautifully comedic and fairly unexpected way. But even that moment is at odds with the fact that viewers are watching a character die, and although it’s done in a joking manner, there’s meant to be some pathos in it. This is a similar issue to “Thor: Love and Thunder,” which wants to be fun and humorous but also have very serious moments, usually abutting directly up against those quips. “Quantumania” is very funny until it isn’t and is meant to be taken very seriously. Having a villain like Kang is similar to the Gorr problem in the fourth “Thor” movie; this is an intense character with majorly sinister designs compelled by unmovable convictions, and he’s surrounded by jokes about Baskin-Robbins and an alien that’s curious about how many holes humans have in their bodies. If you were to dissect “Quantumania,” you’d find that many of these elements work well separately. Majors is fantastic as Kang, a methodical conqueror who is unwavering in his purpose to the point of abject cruelty. The actor commands every scene he’s in, bringing a sort of weariness to the multiversal traveler, but one that never dilutes his calculating drive. And when that veneer of control slips, Majors is tremendous at releasing a true sense of villainous rage at those around him. Similarly, Rudd is still great in the title role, even when it calls on him to be two disparate people: the jokester and the dramatic superhero. They aren’t totally congruous, but separately (in their own movies), they would have a lot to do. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” isn’t the worst Marvel movie. It’s not even a bad movie. It just feels like one type of tale was foisted onto another with competing scales, stakes and characterizations. It has fun scenes and memorable lines, and Kang is properly set up as the MCU’s new Big Bad. However, all of that is found inside a film that tries to do too much, and serve too many masters, without having the finesse to pull it off or the inventiveness to make it their own. Reed and company deserve praise for attempting to fuse these conflicting elements into some new synthesis, but it’s not a wholly successful attempt, unsure of the size of story it wants to tell.

"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too much going on&#44; and not in a positive way&#46; The barrier between the live actors and &#8220;I wonder how much digital tech it took to create the world&#8221; is very thin&#44; and the STAR WARS wannabe plot and atmosphere was formulaic and uninspiring&#46; I&apos;m shrinking&#33;
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," It’s a wonder that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (★★★☆☆) should work as well as it does, or feel half as transporting as it does, when, by the looks of it, the actors were planted inside a studio for the majority of the action, and it shows.  For the size-shifting superhero’s third solo MCU outing, director Peyton Reed — also at the helm for Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp — filmed much of this journey to the sub-atomic fantasia known as the Quantum Realm using technology that surrounds the actors in an immersive digital environment.  Rather than emoting towards blank green and blue screens, Paul Rudd, as thief-turned-Avenger Ant-Man a.k.a. Scott Lang, can gaze across a virtual Quantum Realm and perform face-to-face opposite whatever outlandish creatures the filmmakers might imagine. Marvel actors report that the production tech, known as The Volume, adds authenticity to their experience that presumably we can see onscreen. Does it add to the authenticity of the audience experience? Yes and no. Standing still against the wonderfully realized CGI visions of floating mountains and mushroom forests, the actors pop, and the vistas are breathtaking. Christophe Beck’s vigorous score matches the scale of the vision. In motion, however, the actors sometimes appear to be racing through a video game with little sense of physical gravity. The wild, extra-dimensional concepts of the solid script by first-time feature writer Jeff Loveness evince more substance than some of the visuals. That’s a testament, also, to the studio’s consistently impeccable casting, which pays off handsomely here, in particular, with Michelle Pfeiffer returning as Janet Van Dyne, Hope’s mom, who was rescued from the Quantum Realm in the last film. Janet was stuck down there, in what she calls “a secret universe beneath ours,” for 30 years, as she’s wont to remind everyone, including husband Hank Pym, again ably embodied by Michael Douglas. Apparently, Janet’s kept loads of secrets about how she survived there, and whom she might have encountered. For one, she never told Hank or Hope that the Quantum Realm is not only inhabited, but positively teeming with civilized life. The dynamic of Janet’s family realizing how much of her life and experiences have been kept hidden from them is played poignantly, and with humor, by Pfeiffer, Douglas, and Lilly. Pfeiffer makes Janet a genuine hero, a tough but loving adventurer who doesn’t dwell on regrets, a mom, wife, and wily survivor haunted by elements of her past that she never wanted to share with her family. Though it’s Scott’s teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who blossoms as a hero in this entry, and whose safety motivates Scott above all things, the heart of this movie is Pfeiffer’s Janet Van Dyne. Weighing heavily on her heart is the truth she knows about someone they’ll find in the Quantum Realm, the enigmatic Kang the Conqueror, played with heft and menace by the formidable Jonathan Majors.  That Kang is tipped to play a major role in future MCU films bodes well for the talent we can count on to bring this make-believe to life vividly enough that we keep coming back for more, always watching the credits till the very end.

"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," The thing about Ant-Man is that even when the little guy is essentially saving the universe, he’s still never going to carry the gravitas of a Tony Stark/Iron Man or the heroic majesty of a Steve Rogers/Captain America or the complicated storyline of a Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch. I mean, he’s a regular guy with a cool suit who can get super small or really big. Even as far as superhero monikers go, Ant-Man isn’t in the same league as Thor or Black Panther or Hulk or even Spider-Man, man! What scares you more, a spider or an ant? So here we are in 2023, with Marvel kicking off Phase 5 with the third “Ant-Man” movie and the fifth overall appearance for the character and the 31st movie to date in the ever-expanding MCU, and let’s toss all those numbers aside and celebrate “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” for knowing exactly what it wants to be, i.e., a mostly comedic placeholder in the greater storyline arc. It relies heavily on the strengths of its wonderful cast, led by the ridiculously likable (and often likably ridiculous) Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, and a brilliant supporting cast including generational icons Michael Douglas, Bill Murray and Michelle Pfeiffer; reliable stalwarts Evangeline Lily, Corey Stoll, William Jackson Harper and Katy M. O’Brian — and a suitably formidable villain played by the greatly talented Jonathan Majors.  Clocking in a relatively breezy 125 minutes and featuring a dazzling array of VFX and CGI, “Quantumania” manages to tell an intimate family story against an enormously expansive yet subatomic background. “Quantumania” kicks off on the lightest of notes. With John Sebastian’s theme from “Welcome Back, Kotter” playing on the soundtrack, we see Scott thoroughly enjoy his life as a San Francisco celebrity as beloved as a point guard for the Golden State Warriors. Everyone smiles at him on the street, folks are constantly asking him to pose for selfies with their pups, the corner coffee shop won’t take his money and he has published a memoir titled “Look Out for the Little Guy.” Best of all, Scott’s personal life is thriving, through his romance with girlfriend Hope Van Dyne aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) to his loving relationship with now-teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) to his close connection with Hope’s parents, Hank (Michael Douglas), who is retired but still likes to tinker with ants and science and such, and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who has been released from her 30-year confinement in Quantum Realm. Oh sure, Cassie and Hank and Hope have been secretly messing around with a new device that will help them study the Quantum Realm from a safe distance, but what could possibly go sideways with that? Before you can say “Special Effects Units, Assemble!,” the entire quintet is sucked into the microscopic yet vast world of the Quantum Realm, and just like that we’re plunged into territory that visually and dramatically often bears more resemblance to a “Star Wars” movie than an “Avengers” offshoot. Scott and daughter Cassie land amidst a band of rebels fighting an uphill battle against a fascist regime, while Hank, Janet and Hope are plunked into a Tatooine-like desert landscape before eventually winding up in a joint that looks like a more elaborate version of the Mos Eisley cantina. As they endeavor to find each other and find a way home, our heroes encounter a number of colorful characters who become either allies or foes, including Bill Murray (effortlessly doing his Bill Murray thing) as the duplicitous Lord Krylar, who apparently has quite the history with Janet; Corey Stoll’s Darren from the first “Ant-Man” film, who now has morphed into the ludicrous and hideous M.O.D.O.K. (Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing); William Jackson Harper’s Quaz, whose forehead glows as he reads your thoughts, and Katy M. O’Brien’s Jentorra, the fearless freedom fighter leading the rebellion effort. Oh, and the Quantum Realm is filled with all sorts of vibrant and bizarre creatures, including a guy with a broccoli head; a gooey entity known as Veb who laments not having “holes,” like humans have, and all sorts of beings that look like they just missed the cut in being cast in “Avatar: The Way of Water.” Mostly, though, Scott and company must contend with Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror, a time-manipulating, seemingly invincible supervillain with a universe-conquering record and megalomaniacal ambitions that make Thanos seem like a small businessman. Even though “Quantumania” retains a mostly comedic tone throughout, Kang doesn’t know he’s in something of a romp; for him, the stakes couldn’t be greater, and he will destroy entire civilizations for breakfast if it means getting his way. Jonathan Majors alternates between brooding, carefully constructed line readings and teeth-rattling, spittle-spewing, fiercely delivered monologues, as if he’s standing on the stage at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater. He is magnificent. (The flashback sequences explaining Kang’s history with Janet are among the most compelling in the entire film.) “Quantumania” is a mid-tier MCU film, with decent enough battle sequences and some nifty visuals, but we’re here mostly for the popcorn-movie enjoyment of watching Paul Rudd et al., do their thing, and once again, the little guy and gang come through."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL," It feels like a short and long time since we’ve had a Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film. Truly, what is time anymore? Torn between “superhero fatigue” (note: not tiredness of superheroes specifically, but of the mundane storytelling and repetitiveness in recent films) and wanting to know what comes next, I had to figure out what to expect at the beginning of Phase 5.  I entered the Canadian Premiere of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania with zero expectations. However, one thought was that I might root for the villain, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), something that was confirmed by one of the film’s stars, Kathryn Newton, when she told theatregoers she was most excited for them to see Kang. Once the film was over, I was intrigued about the possibilities for the future, but quickly realized that did not outweigh the disappointment concerning most of the storytelling throughout. Quantumania begins with the lovable Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) letting the audience know about his life post the events of Avengers: Endgame. With a recognizable face, he gets coffee on the house, and diners send drinks to his table. You know, all the perks afforded to a superhero who was part of saving the world. Fellow superhero and Scott’s significant other, Hope van Dyne, a.k.a. Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), has been making moves, taking Pym Technologies and improving lives for the better. Cassie Lang (Newton) is also trying to follow in the footsteps of her father and Hope. However, she has a penchant for finding trouble with every good deed she pursues. Scott tries his best to talk sense into her, but you know how stubborn teenagers can be. However, trouble finds Cassie again after she and Hank (Michael Douglas) create a device which is supposed to map the Quantum Realm but also sends a signal to it. Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) is terrified of where this machine is sending its call, and the result explains why. Suddenly, the group is sucked into the Quantum Realm, the last place Janet wants to return to and the same place she’d warned her husband and daughter about since her rescue in the previous instalment. The leading cause of Janet’s fear? Kang. While comedy is subjective, for the majority of Quantumania, it served to be the film’s biggest faux pas and was a hindrance to the greater story being told. Instead of leaning into some of the more emotionally resonant story beats or the chilling Conqueror at the helm of Janet’s fears, the writing team seemed content with burying a story that could have been more compelling beneath repetitive wisecracks. Even those who are used to and enjoy the MCU’s brand of humour might find this one a slog to sit through. Every moment does not require a joke at the end. In fact, most of these moments seemed like they were inserted only to distract from the misfires in the actual script. Since the first film was released, plenty have regarded this particular franchise in the MCU as filler, and finally, there was the chance to beat this allegation, but it’s ultimately squandered. This is what makes Quantumania so frustrating. There are moments that tried to tell a good tale, which includes interesting ideas, and at times, compelling character choices that could have been the making of a great Ant-Man movie. There are some truly enjoyable creatures and places in the Quantum Realm that is yearning to be explored.  It gave similar vibes to venturing to new places or planets in the Star Wars universe–which makes sense considering Quantumania‘s director, Peyton Reed, is a big fan of the franchise. Therefore, there was a great chance for worldbuilding in the third installment of the franchise, and while it worked in some areas, it faltered in others. The chances were there for the taking, but much of it is lost in sloppy storytelling and exasperating comedic beats. Perhaps the superhero fatigue finally got me, or perhaps the MCU is just unable to recapture some of its past glory days. That said, at least the film succeeds in establishing the MCU’s next Big Bad. However, neither Majors, Pfeiffer, nor the naturally charming Rudd can save Quantumania from itself. For a plethora of reasons, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is nowhere near as good as it needs to be to usher in a new phase of the MCU. "
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Aunque siempre me ha resultado aburrido y problemático el argumento de que Marvel Studios tiene una fórmula que recicla para construir su universo cinematográfico, “Antman and the Wasp: Quantunmania” es el tipo de película que alimenta ese argumento. La tercera película de Antman, que estrena este jueves en los cines de la Isla, elimina el tono cómico distintivo de los primeros dos filmes y trata de entregarle al público la escala de una película de los Avengers. Lo que gana en acción, aventura y entretenimiento no quita que la producción tenga un aire genérico y en muchas ocasiones predecible. De hecho, en varias secuencias claves el director Peyton Reed parece tomar más inspiración de la primera trilogía de Star Wars que de sus primeras dos películas."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Launching the MCU’s Phase Five after a somewhat underwhelming Phase 4, the movie is a colorful and entertaining entry in both the Ant-Man and greater MCU franchises. Even if Quantumania is a better title than a movie (similar to last year’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness), the result proves an easier watch than the last two MCU titles, the disappointing Thor: Love and Thunder and the overstuffed Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Regardless, it’s not as accessible as previous Ant-Man movies. Along with the MCU shows on Disney+, the movies lately have been preoccupied with the multiverse, fractured timelines, and the aftereffects of Thanos. It’s all very entrenched in its mythology, which can seem overwhelming if you’re not keeping up. Moreover, since Quantumania’s raison d’être is establishing the new big bad—Kang (Jonathan Majors), whose presence will shape the next two Avengers movies in 2025 and 2026—the proceedings can feel overly tied to the MCU’s many branches. So, after catching up with 30 films and a handful of TV series, you might feel primed for this.  When the story opens, Scott Lang feels pretty good about himself. And why not? He helped save the world after Thanos. Now he rests on his laurels in San Francisco, spending his time on photo ops and promoting his new book—the cornily titled Look Out for the Little Guy! His daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), has grown into an activist teen, ready to fight for any underdog. She’s also a scientist like her father’s mentor, Hank Pym (Douglas). Together, Cassie and Hank built a mini-satellite to monitor the quantum realm—the subatomic world beneath our own. But just as Janet van Dyne (Pfeiffer) warns them not to communicate with the quantum realm, that something dangerous exists there—after all, she spent 30 years trapped there and would know—the group, including Hope, aka the Wasp (Lilly), are sucked into the quantum realm by someone who latches onto their frequency. Scott and Cassie find themselves separated from Hank, Janet, and Hope, in a place Janet describes as having “worlds within worlds” that are “outside time and space.” What Janet failed to tell everyone about her years in the quantum realm is that entire universes exist on a subatomic level, complete with a resident emperor, Kang, who other Kangs have exiled from other universes for wiping out entire timelines. Trapped and overseeing an infinitesimal domain of his construction, Kang—the Rick Sanchez of MCU—needs Pym Particles to escape and exact revenge on other Kangs from other universes. He eventually enlists Scott to help, using the imprisoned Cassie as leverage. Along the way, Scott and Cassie meet with a group of rebel freedom fighters who organize to dethrone Kang and his army of mechanized stormtroopers. At the same time, Janet leads Hank and Hope through the treacherous environs of this sci-fi landscape, complete with broccoli-headed aliens, a stop at the local cantina, and a cameo appearance by Bill Murray as a duplicitous wheeler-dealer. Emperors, stormtroopers, rebels, and cantinas—if you think this all sounds like Star Wars, you’re not wrong. Screenwriter Jeff Loveness, best known for Rick and Morty, doesn’t bother to conceal his influences.  While it’s easy to accept the clunky plot machinations, there’s plenty to savor in Quantumania’s world-building and humor, often at the same time. The quantum realm recalls last year’s Strange World—given its multicolored subterranean ecosystem inhabited by bizarre creatures, such as subatomic squirrels, jellyfish, and single-celled behemoths—crossed with a vast metropolis. The movie also boasts a fascinating array of amusing humanoid aliens who look more inspired than the last 20 or so years of Star Wars concepts. One gloopy rebel named Veb (voiced by David Dastmalchian, who played a Russian ex-con in the previous two Ant-Man movies) excretes an ooze that functions as a universal translation agent and remains fascinated by Scott’s orifices. Another character, named MODOK (Mechanical Organism Designed Only for Killing)—one of Marvel’s sillier creations—marks the return of Corey Stoll to the MCU after disappearing in Ant-Man. Now, he’s an oversized head with tiny arms and legs, encased within a weaponized floating suit and stricken with an identity complex.  Director Peyton Reed, who helmed both previous Ant-Man movies, returns with a much larger-scale production than its relatively minor predecessors. At any given moment, the characters inhabit a CGI world populated with CGI characters who shoot CGI lasers and ride in CGI ships or atop CGI animals. It all looks costly. Even so, cinematographer William Pope—a regular collaborator with the Wachowskis (The Matrix trilogy) and Sam Raimi (Spider-Man 2 and 3)—renders some stunning imagery amid the digital flatness of the backdrop. Unfortunately, the editors (Adam Gerstel, Laura Jennings) do the footage a disservice by chopping the action during the rebellion scenes or borderline unintelligible sequences where Ant-Man, the Wasp, or Cassie have shrunk to microscopic size. Better are those sequences involving an embiggened Ant-Man, who slowly marches into Kang’s territory to unleash hell. The final bout is also tense. "
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the 31st entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it serves as the kickoff to the franchise’s fifth phase. ""Serves"" is the key word because all this installment does is set up what comes next in terms of new characters and storylines. To quote the franchise’s new supervillain, Kang the Conqueror: ""It’s never over."" Not that I want it to be finished, either. I am still keeping track, but this movie takes bombast and chaos to extremes, especially with this heavy sci-fi focus on multiverses, variants, incursions and more metaphysical jargon. Following a Marvel movie should not require an ounce of brainpower. These are not think pieces. The two previous ""Ant-Man"" entries, both directed by Peyton Reed, have upheld the adage that ""good things come in small packages."" They were built less on spectacle and more on the charm, cuteness and comedic timing of Paul Rudd, aka Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man. This movie, also directed by Peyton, does the impossible, squandering Rudd’s appeal as the jailbird turned shrinking superhero. Casual fans will struggle to follow along, especially if they missed the Disney+ series ""Loki,"" which sheds light on the convoluted plot of ""Quantumania."" So, to bring those folks up to speed, Scott and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lily, aka Wasp) and their blended family − her parents, Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne (Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer) and Scott's teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton) − find themselves sucked into a galaxy far, far away, ""outside time and space."" This trippy subatomic world gives off major ""Star Wars"" vibes. George Lucas has every right to ring up his attorneys. Characters drink colorful cocktails in lively pubs populated with creatures resembling castoffs from Mos Eisley Cantina. They travel via spaceships and fire blasters at each other. Jonathan Majors turns up as Kang, a Sith-like evil emperor. A version of that character was introduced in ""Loki."" The rebels are led by Jentorra (Katy M. O’Brian), a fierce female warrior. Her telepathic sidekick, Quaz (William Jackson Harper), helps fill some of the movie’s humor void. Upon landing in the Quantum Realm, the group is separated. Scott and Cassie end up in the hands of the rebels. Hope, Hank and Janet work with the latter’s old associates to get help finding the others. Remember, Janet was trapped in the realm for 30 years, and apparently she was very popular down there. Kang the Conqueror, who is even more evil than Thanos, has other ideas. He needs those elusive Pym particles to power up his multiverse-hopping ship so he can leave the Quantum Realm and get on with screwing up multiple worlds and timelines. Obi Wan … err … Ant-Man and his old thieving skills are Kang’s only hope, so he backs the superhero into a corner and forces him to help. ""Quantumania’s"" best moments belong to Rudd, who entered the MCU in 2015. Throughout his run as Ant-Man, he has been game for anything. No difference here. After a pre-title sequence, the movie opens with Rudd’s Scott adorably strolling down a San Francisco street, fist-bumping and taking selfies with dogs as John Sebastian’s theme song to ""Welcome Back Kotter"" plays. Scott is in a happy post-Blip phase of his life. ""It’s been a crazy few years,"" he says in voiceover before the camera arrives at a bookstore where Scott reads passages aloud from his memoir, ""Look Out for the Little Guy!"" Over the course of the film, Jeff Loveness’ script offers a few surprises that I will not spoil. What’s obvious, though, is that Marvel has cast a compelling villain in Majors, who gave an acclaimed turn in last year’s historical drama ""Devotion."" As Kang, the ""monster who thinks he’s a god,"" Majors is all might and menace. The force is definitely strong with this one."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," Peyton Reed’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania marks the official beginning of Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But has MCU fatigue set in after the lackluster performance of Phase 4? The film opens with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), aka Ant-Man, enjoying a modicum of success as a universe-saving Avenger with high fives on the street from passers-by, the release of his best-selling book, Look Out for the Little Guy (scheduled for an actual release in September), and a happy home life with Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Hank (Michael Douglas), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Scott’s daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). Did I say happy home? During a book signing, Scott is forced to leave early to bail Cassie out of jail. It’s not what you think. She was arrested during a peaceful protest to stand up for the city’s homeless. She finds herself disappointed that Scott would rather live the rest of his life as a celebrity than help people… like an Avenger should. And now comes the superhero stuff. During the “blip,” Cassie studied Hank’s journey. With Hank’s help, Cassie built a “radio” to the quantum realm. Realizing this is a bad idea, Janet tells Cassie to shut it off, but before you know it, Ant-Man, Wasp, Janet, Hank, and Cassie are sucked into the Quantum Realm. Scott and Cassie are split up from the others. Janet is freaked out because she knows what danger everyone is in and never talked about it to Hank and Hope after she returned. Long story short, the evil Kang (Jonathan Majors) was banished to the Quantum Realm by… stay for the end credits of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania or watch the last episode of season 1 of Loki. While in the quantum realm, Janet unwittingly helped Kang build a device to return both of them to Janet’s reality. However, she figured out his evil plan of domination and destroyed the machine. Now the angry man has become the totalitarian dictator of the quantum realm. He subjugates its denizens and builds an army to invade Earth eventually. However, Kang needs the Pym particle technology that powers Scott to fulfill his dream. To say Marvel's phase 4 has been a complete clown show is an understatement. With subpar Disney+ shows and movies that suffered from terrible writing and... It's not much of an exaggeration to say that Avengers: Endgame is the biggest movie ever. The biggest in terms of cast, in terms of scale, in terms of... I was a huge Marvel Comics kid back in the 80’s. Although I was primarily an X-Men fan, I read Avengers too. Yellow Jacket was my favorite Avenger until... Film Threat cares about your privacy and the security of your information.

"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE," Welcome back to “Ant-Man” and the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is that “subatomic universe,” resembling an even more hallucinatory version of Alice’s Wonderland combined with the many strange worlds of “Star Wars,” where Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) was trapped for decades. In this new “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” the entire Lang-Pym-Van Dyne clan – Janet Van Dyne, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Hope Van Dyne aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), Scott Lang aka size-shifting Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and his daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) – are sucked back into the Realm. The villain of this piece of the Marvel MCU (“Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is the first film of “Phase Five” of the MCU output) is Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a power-mad, human “traveler,” who was saved by Janet when he landed in the Quantum realm years earlier. Kang travels in a small, unimpressive, velvet-lined vessel with a built-in armchair. Cassie is now a budding scientist, who lands in jail for the “third time” for using her own Ant-Man powers to reduce a police cruiser in size at a protest. The Quantum Realm is more like the Land of Deja Vu. Everything is vaguely familiar. Written by Jeff Loveness (TV’s “Rick and Morty”), “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” appears to be a spin-off of the original “Star Wars” cantina sequence with the Quantum inhabitants resembling cantina regulars and entertainers. These include a mighty woman warrior named Jentorra (Katy M. O’Brian) and an alien character who seems to be made of Jell-O, has “no holes” and whose “ooze” can be drunk and will render the drinker able to understand the language of the Quantum people. Yes, but ugh. Like most superhero moves, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is repetitive. Super-hero-with-an-inferiority-complex Scott Lang still likes to remind people that he is an Avenger and that he helped “save the world.” In the Quantum realm, we see floating faces, undersea imagery and meet a sentient broccoli. The canceled Bill Murray shows up as a powerful Quantumian (?), who claims to have known Janet in the biblical sense and whose exit scene is the best in the film. Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) of the earlier “Ant-Man” films returns in a new form. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” (how I love to type that title) also owes a debt to that great lost-in-a-magical-realm tale; “The Wizard of Oz.” It’s all about going home. How many CGI-heavy, special effects sequences inspired by the art of Jack Kirby can you take? Fans have no limits. The rest of the world does. Kang captures Ant-Man and Cassie and forces Ant-Man to retrieve a power source for him. He might as well be Emperor Ming. Director Peyton Reed (“Yes Man”), returning for a third “Ant-Man” film, gives newcomers Majors (TV’s “Lovecraft Country” and soon-to-come “Creed III”) and Newton (TV’s “Big Little Lies”) more close-ups than their elders. This new “Ant-Man” film is playfully in love with multiplication. Hank wonders if any of his “smart ants” have been transported with them. Hmm. We are reminded more than once that Scott was fired from his job at Baskin-Robbins (B-R HQ is in Canton). Rudd is fun, but not all the time, and he fights like a sissy. The talented, super-buff Majors could crack him like a nut. Lilly pumps her scenes full of energy, but doesn’t have enough of them. In scenes reminiscent of kaiju classics, a giant Scott is riddled with automatic weapons fire. I was glad that “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” was just over two hours. For a superhero film, that’s a short."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," I accept that if you had told me I’d be moved to tears by the musings of a one-inch talking shell, I would have been concerned. Crafted as a mockumentary, this imaginative stop-motion film from director Dean Fleischer Camp focuses on Marcel (voiced by Jenny Slate), a tiny shell who lives in a suburban human house with his grandma, Connie (Isabella Rossellini). The residents of the house have gone and an Airbnb guest, documentary maker Dean, finds Marcel and Connie and starts to make a film about their peculiar little life. Soon, as is the way of the modern world, Marcel becomes an internet sensation with fans travelling far and wide to perform TikTok dances on his lawn.  And while he’s both full of purpose and poignancy on the journey to find his family, there’s also a tremendous amount of humour, with many scenes being laugh-out-loud funny. That’s the remarkable thing about this unusual film — there’s a magical little shell with one eye, and feet, that articulates the power of love and heartbreak we all feel in the most conscious, innocent way. Posing for selfies and signing copies of his autobiography Look Out For The Little Guy are the new norm for the superhero, played by Paul Rudd.  But his world is turned upside down when daughter Cassie’s attempt to map the Quantum Realm goes wrong and sucks in her dad and mum Hope van Dyne, aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly). The main problem is that director Florian Zeller jettisons the approach which made The Father so original – looking at dementia through the patient’s eyes. Rather than telling this story of teen depression from the perspective of son Nicholas (Zen McGrath) Zeller opts for the viewpoint of the dad Peter (Jackman). "
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE," Press releases for each new entry in the world’s most expensive television-show-masquerading-as-a-film-series always come with a warning: Critics are not to reveal cameos, detailed plot points, spoilers, or character developments in their reviews, which leaves very little to go on by way of producing a piece of film criticism worth reading. Since we live in an increasingly spoiler-phobic culture, one which has an ever-expanding list of criteria as to what even constitutes a spoiler, the most we in the press can really do is say whether or not the latest MCU entry is any good. Thumbs up emoji vs thumbs down emoji. It’s a pain to be so limited, but if that’s the bed that has been made for me, I will sleep in it as requested. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is not good (thumbs down emoji). But here’s the rub: it’s not bad either. It just is. It’s exactly what we have all come to expect from the ever-churning Disney/Marvel machine and its safe-for-mass-consumption products. Sometimes they are good, other times they are bad, but for the most part they are just decent enough to keep us all hopping over to the theater for the next one, or at least pressing play when they become available for streaming a month or two later. It’s the Chipotle-fication of superhero cinema: Quick and easy, tasty enough, but without any potential to be truly great. Quantumania picks up where we last left off, I think. Ant-Man (Paul “I’m finally starting to show a little bit of my age, but only a little and I’m still a hunk” Rudd) has spent his post-Snap time writing a memoir and getting used to the fact that his daughter is now played by a completely different person (Kathryn Newton). Everyone loves him, including his old boss at the Dairy Queen (or is it Baskin Robbins? Oh, I don’t care), and it seems that his family is finally starting to feel whole, even if he still has trouble communicating with his daughter. One night after dinner, in which a tiny pizza is expanded into a full sized pizza, the entire family is sucked into the quantum realm due to things that I am not allowed to tell you. Once there, the plucky group of actors who are way better than this material get involved with the many mini-cultures that live in this microscopic universe of CGI gobbledygook, all of whom are at war against a shared enemy. I’m not sure I am allowed to say who it is, but you know. The prior Ant-Man films were the most expressly comedic in the MCU, and it’s their light tone that made them feel special amidst the more drama-heavy adventures of the rest of the Avengers. Unfortunately, the style of comedy employed in the Ant-Man series thus far just doesn’t translate to the big (little) cosmic (quantum) scale. It is remarkable, given the natural comic talent of Rudd and some of his supporting players, that so much of it falls flat. It’s not even like the gags land as groaners — they just don’t land at all (the absence of Michael Peña’s Luis is heavily felt). The size-play, for lack of better terminology, classically made for a lot of fun perspective shifts, and was a playful visual tool for the heist movie-adjacent stories to which it was applied, but now that Ant-Man and friends are relegated to the quantum realm, the size shift stuff doesn’t really come into play, short of being a method through which our titular hero is able to punch really hard. Remember when the transformation sequences in the latter Transformers movies were reduced to a quick gnashing of pixels, thus eliminating the whole reason Transformers even existed? It feels like that. In trying to push the multiversal expansion of the already unwieldy MCU, we’ve lost a lot of the wonder that gives each individual hero their identity. Scott Lang might as well be any of the other Avengers, in that his defining characteristic is that he can punch hard, withstand damage, and be charming. Visually, Quantumania introduces a handful of fun ideas, but they are all executed in that special, bland way that can only be created in a green box in Georgia by underpaid effects workers. There’s a wealth of detail rendered, but its artless application leaves everything looking and feeling like nonsense. The typical deflection of MCU criticism goes like this: “You have to think of it in terms of being a piece of a larger story rather than its own thing.” Honestly, fair enough. The MCU is an ongoing experiment, and if the identity of the films moving forward is more of a large scale serialization than a parade of individual stories, so be it. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that — there are plenty of non-serialized films to be had — But if that’s the direction the MCU is going to go, they have to commit. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania fails both as a singular film and as a piece of the larger puzzle. By the end, the larger universe’s narrative has been progressed only insofar as what we all already knew going into it: Kang is the new big bad guy, here to fill Thanos’ large purple shoes."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE," ★☆☆☆☆Near the mostly meaningless climax of this, yes, 31st film from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the underserved and underwritten villain Kang (Jonathan Majors) roars: “You still can’t see it, can you? It’s never over!” Well, it’s certainly beginning to feel like that, as a once vibrant blockbuster machine churns out yet another dirge that’s as empty and disengaged as the recent Thor and Doctor Strange instalments, and as insufferably sanctimonious as the bum-numbing Eternals."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE," It can be tough to keep up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but if one is on top of the vast saga, the new Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, which launches “Phase 5,” has a lot to offer, even if not all of it sticks. Filled with jokes, battles, George Lucas-inspired creatures, questionable CGI, twisting narrative curves, and the complicated science of the multiverse, the film is a lot to handle. Byzantine structure notwithstanding, both busy and messy in equal measure, it’s also often engaging, thanks in no small part to the performance of Jonathan Majors (Devotion), who incarnates principal antagonist Kang the Conqueror. I’d watch the man in just about anything, as he elevates everything he touches. We begin in San Francisco in the aftermath not only of the Thanos “blip” of Phase 3 (which affected the end of the last Ant-Man and the Wasp film), but also of all the films made since, along with the many Disney+ series. Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd, once more), is living the dream, his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton, Freaky) now by his side (when not arrested for civil disobedience) and Hope Van Dyne, aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly, also reprising), a faithful romantic partner. In a jokey opening montage, set to the theme from “Welcome Back, Kotter,” he even appears to have made nice with FBI agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park, Always Be My Maybe). Life is very fine. Until it isn’t. It turns out that Cassie, working with Hope and her father, Hank Pym (a returning Michael Douglas), has designed a miniature satellite to communicate with particles down in the Quantum Realm, from which Hope’s mother, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer, back for more), was recently rescued. Ah, had they but run this by Janet first, the ensuing violent misadventures might never have happened. But then there would be no movie. For something wicked lurks down in the microscopic world below, hinted at in a prologue set before Janet’s escape. That something is a someone: Kang, last seen in the final episode of Season 1 of Loki, at the end of time, where he explained that only he could stop the Kangs from every other universe from destroying life as we know it. Too bad that Sophie, Loki’s twin from another dimension, killed him. But here he is again, somehow, and not happy to be stranded with a power source. Locating Janet’s signal thanks to Cassie’s satellite, he pulls everyone into the Quantum Realm, exploding Scott’s fantasies of peace and quiet. Everyone must rise to the occasion, including Hank’s trained ants. Along the way, we meet plenty of new characters and are treated to a delightful cameo from Bill Murray (On the Rocks). We also find ourselves mired in rather ordinary action sequences and lengthy exposition. Occasionally, there are cool moments such as replicating Scotts in a probability storm that raise the sci-fi/action bar. Overall, we have fun, even if these endless treatises on the multiverse that Marvel is further developing prove tiring through repetition. What novelty exists here threatens to be swallowed by the ever-escalating stakes that were missing in the last two Ant-Man films, which were blissfully scaled smaller than their Avengers counterparts. Still, Rudd is charming and Majors riveting. That’s enough to carry us through, along with some interesting mid-credits and post-credits scenes.

"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” now playing on theatres, kicks off Marvel’s phase five with a talky sci fi story, heavy on the scientific blather. Instead of “Quantumania,” a more appropriate subtitle could have been: More Fun Than Physics Class! “It’s a pretty good world,” says Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a.k.a. Ant-Man. He’s a member of the Avengers, gifted with the power of size manipulation and some funny dialogue. “I’m glad I saved it.” Basking in the glow of his heroic contributions to mankind, he’s written a book titled “Look Out for the Little Guy,” and shamelessly drinks in the praise of his friends and fans. His family, however, thinks he is resting on his laurels, and, in secret, are still working on ways to help the planet. His romantic partner Hope van Dyne, a.k.a. Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) and the original Ant-Man Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), have created a sort of satellite for deep space, except it connects them to the Quantum Realm, a subatomic level where the realities of space and time don’t exist. Having spent 30 years trapped in the subatomic world, Hope’s mother Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) is horrified by their experiments. “Do you know how dangerous the Quantum Realm is? Turn it off now.” Of course, Cassie and Co learn too late that the connection to the Quantum Realm goes both ways, and they are all sucked into the satellite and transported to the strange world, a place that looks like a Yes album cover from 1973 come to life. Separated into two groups, Scott and Cassie are captured by freedom fighters led by Jentorra (Katy O’Brian), while Hope, Hank and Janet are cut loose, on the run from Janet’s old nemesis, a destroyer of worlds called Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). Kang needs the Pym Particles, the subatomic particles developed by Hank which can increase or reduce mass as well as density and strength, to exit the Quantum Realm and travel through time and bring havoc to the real world. Only Ant-Man and his ragtag gang can stop him and his interdimensional threat, but only if they can navigate the Quantum Realm and come together as a group. There is a lightness of touch to “Quantumania.” Rudd’s charisma sees to that, and he provides some genuinely funny moments in the film. Majors brings the secret sauce as a great cartoon villain, but the talky script and messy action scenes suck away much of the fun. You may be thinking, “But Michael Douglas talks to a giant ant. How can that be bad?” True enough, it is something I never would have expected to see, and I got a kick out of it, but for every nifty moment like that, there is sea of exposition, as if the filmmakers don’t trust the audience to understand what is happening unless it is spelled out for them. The loud, CGI-overload climax fills the screen but doesn’t grab the imagination. There are cool creatures and action enough for any two movies, but it all feels thrown at the screen, willy-nilly. There is a lot of it, but none of it is memorable or particularly original. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is a let-down, a movie that feels more like an introduction to the next batch of MCU movies than a standalone.

"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," Despite all his contributions to the Avengers and his role in saving the world from Thanos’s genocidal bend, Ant-Man’s own films have been largely trivial in the grand scheme of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The villains and storylines of Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) have been essentially insular, with fewer repercussions to the broader MCU when compared to the films of his peers in the Avengers. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For all the delights and excesses that come with tying together several plot lines across a menagerie of feature films and TV shows, the first two Ant-Man films presented a comic relief and goofiness that was a respite from the crocheted stories of the MCU. Some of that light-heartedness is sacrificed in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. The film retains some of that awkward, quippy comedy that Paul Rudd is known for, but in making the latest Ant-Man offering more significant to Marvel’s gameplan for the next year, the humour has been pruned to serve the blockbuster engine. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania signals the start of the fifth phase of the MCU. The story begins when the family of microscopic heroes — which include Scott Lang (Rudd), Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) — get unwillingly sucked into the Quantum Realm. This minute universe within ours is rendered with breathtaking splendour, comparable to James Cameron’s Pandora in Avatar. The Quantum Realm has its own indigenous flora and fauna, from tardigrades and mammoth-sized single-cell organisms to entire civilisations with their own customs and political allegiances. However, the deeper we venture into the story, and the Quantum Realm, it becomes clear that the film is less about Ant-Man, than it is a vehicle to introduce the big baddie of phase five of the MCU: Kang the Conqueror. Though Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania marks the debut of Kang, we first saw Jonathan Majors take up the character — or, at least, a variant of him — in the series Loki. There Kang went by He Who Remains, the secret head of the Time Variance Authority, or TVA. He was the villain in Loki, but as it turns out, he was a more benevolent version of Kang and aimed to ensure a single timeline to keep other versions of himself from appearing. It is from this act that the Kang in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania springs. Exiled by unknown forces into the Quantum Realm, Kang’s first encounter was with Janet van Dyne while she herself was trapped in the minute universe. As we learn from the beginning of the film, Janet has been largely guarded about her experiences in the Quantum Realm when she was stranded for 30 years, but as she and her family are forcibly pulled back in, she has little choice but to delve into those details. Despite strong performances by the main cast, particularly from Pfeiffer and Majors, it is the supporting characters that put the breath of life in the show. There is a wonderful cameo by Bill Murray, who takes on the role of Lord Kylar that fits snugly in his catalogue of eccentric characters. The Good Place actor William Jackson Harper gives a gleeful performance as the telepath Quaz. But the most surprising and humorous is, perhaps, Corey Stoll’s return. Not so much as Darren Cross, the cruel businessman who dons the Yellowjacket suit in the first Ant-Man, but as a deranged remanant of his former self, a giant bob-head like figure known as Modok, who will be a familiar face for those who have seen the eponymous 2021 animated series. The fight scenes are spectacular, although a smidge shyer than the MCU’s more epic blockbuster offerings, including Avengers: Infinity Wars. But for those who recall the warnings He Who Remains gave in Loki (or even simply take a look at the titles the MCU has slated for the next year), it becomes quite clear how the film will end even before it begins. In Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Kang the Conqueror is one of the variants that He Who Remains wanted to stifle out of existence, warning of the mayhem that would ensue if his more belligerent counterparts were allowed to exist. Whether or not Ant-Man and Wasp manage to defeat him by the end of the film, it is already clear from the beginning that there will be more Kangs to reckon with, as Majors is already confirmed to reprise the role in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars. As such, the stakes are not so high in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. If it isn’t this Kang that will break out of the Quantum Realm, there will be others to fight — a whole council of them, in fact. Don’t let the film’s title deceive you, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a prelude to the saga of Kang, served in excessive MCU-fashion to hype up the year ahead."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," First things first: It’s not technically an Ant-Man movie if it doesn’t include a storytelling sequence from Michael Peña’s character Luis. And Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania regrettably does not. But of all the movie’s sins, that egregious omission is the least of our worries.  ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMMANIA ★★ (2/4 stars)
Directed by: Peyton Reed
Written by: Jeff Loveness
Starring: Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Jonathan Majors, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Kathryn Newton, David Dastmalchian, William Jackson Harper, Katy O'Brian, Bill Murray
Running time: 124 mins. The 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which sets up Phase 5 and acts as a sequel to 2018’s Ant-Man and the Wasp, is decently entertaining. Its villain, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), is captivating and largely believable, even if the viewer leaves uncertain of his motivation. Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) is a fun teaser of what Young Avengers could become. Paul Rudd does his best Paul Rudd, despite being hampered by an overly serious storyline. But Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is ultimately one of Marvel’s dullest and most unnecessary movies to date.  The plot, when you can follow it, barely matters. Suffice to say Scott Lang (Rudd), Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) inadvertently get trapped in the Quantum Realm. Janet, who spent 30 years there, has been hiding the scope of the realm, which looks like a mash-up of Star Wars and Dune. While stuck, she prevented Kang from being able to escape, leading to a lasting conflict between the villain and the realm’s colorful, alien-like inhabitants. Kang needs Pym particles to facilitate his escape—and to continue conquering worlds and timelines throughout the multiverse—and Scott’s arrival proves to be the key he’s been waiting for.  The result is a jumbled collection of action and battle scenes that look dark and muddled in spite of the incredible CGI and visual effects efforts of hundreds of people. The characters who live in the Quantum Realm are imaginative and visually impressive, but they are stuffed into sequences that feel hard to follow. We meet some interesting new inclusions, like Katy O'Brian’s ferocious Jentorra and Bill Murray’s Krylar, but there’s no explanation as to who lives in the Quantum Realm and their history there. There’s also no explanation of the multiverse and Kang’s roles in its incursions. If you watched Loki, you might have some semblance of where this is going, but, at this point, is there just too much Marvel lore to keep track of?  Instead of giving Ant-Man his own story, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania uses the hero as fodder to set up this next phase of the MCU (it will continue with the third Guardians of the Galaxy film in May). The prior two Ant-Man movies have been lively and fun, with jokes aplenty. There are some jokes here, but most of them don’t land (or they didn’t at my press screening). Credit to the actors for trying their best opposite what must have been many, many green screens, but Ant-Man and Rudd deserved a proper showcase for the character. Somewhere in the midst of all the CGI and plot chaos, there are a few lovely moments between Scott and Cassie. That’s the movie this should have been.  Fans of the MCU—of which I am one—have been devoted to the endless storylines and superheroes for over a decade. We’ve watched hundreds of hours of movies and TV series and speculated about post-credit scenes. But it’s starting to feel like a sensory overload. What made Iron Man and Captain America so great was that they were about singular, compelling protagonists in high stakes situations that felt like augmented reality. Now we have to understand the multiverse, the Quantum Realm, incursions and keep track of dozens of characters and how they relate to each other. In 2023 alone, there will be two more movies and possibly five TV series. It’s a lot. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a nice two-hour diversion, although not essential viewing. Had they included Luis I might feel differently.  We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience. But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.

"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," Marvel presenta a su nuevo villano en 'Ant-Man y la Avispa: Quantumanía', una gran aventura que no quiere desatarse del todo de la épica de la franquicia. 'Ant-Man y la Avispa: Quantumanía' quiere arriesgar y que te lo pases bien. Pese a su oscuro inicio, las buenas y locas ideas inundan la pantalla en un intento por replicar a la Marvel Comics más valiente, la de la mitología tecnoespacial de Jack Kirby, para abrazar la ciencia ficción sinvergüenza que ya han conseguido emular en aciertos como la brillante 'Thor: Ragnarok' (Taika Waititi, 2017). Con todo a su favor tras el desencanto de muchos marvelitas con la Fase 4, y el adorado por todos Paul Rudd como protagonista, era fácil adentrarse en la sala con las expectativas altas, deseando lanzarse a un colorido tebeo que, sin embargo, ha terminado perdiendo tono por el camino. Una estupenda Michelle Pfeiffer nos sirve de guía en esta historia sobre cómo las dos generaciones de Ant-Man y Avispa, más la pequeña de la familia, son absorbidos al Reino Cuántico, el mundo subatómico de la casa de las ideas en el que viven todo tipo de criaturas. Una excusa ideal para vivir una gran aventura que, pese a contar con una buena lista de excelentes ingredientes, termina repitiendo el esquema habitual de la franquicia de un modo sorprendentemente anodino. La apatía de Paul Rudd, arquetipo del buen rollo de la industria, debió ser el primer farolillo rojo durante el rodaje de una película que, queriendo mostrarnos un nuevo mundo infinito, parece incapaz de escapar de un escenario naranja con soldados masilla como amenaza a derrotar. Personajes como el descacharrante M.O.D.O.K. contrastan con la incapacidad de la trama por escapar de una monotonía que termina contagiando hasta a Kang el Conquistador, el nuevo gran enemigo encarnado por Jonathan Majors que parecía mucho más amenazador en su aparición en la serie 'Loki' que en esta presentación oficial. Es muy difícil separarse del todo de la pátina de épica de esta franquicia en imparable expansión, pero si nos prometen un viaje al multiverso de la locura necesitamos algo más de luz y color (al menos al inicio) para que podamos reencontrarnos con la sensación de maravilla que seguimos persiguiendo.

"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania blasts our heroes into the Quantum Realm for a new adventure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This superhero film kicks off Phase Five of the MCU and features Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and his now-grown daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) as they travel to an unfamiliar realm and take on a new foe known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). Despite Marvel’s track record of providing fun, easily digestible entertainment, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off Phase Five with a whimper, providing an overstuffed, lifeless superhero extravaganza that exists to set up more in the future. What made the first two Ant-Man films successful? Those movies were intentionally small-scale with low, lighthearted stakes. As a result, they’re funny, breezy, and rewatchable. This movie entirely forgets what made the first two work, throwing Ant-Man into a CGI-filled world of colorful creatures. An adventure almost wholly set in the Quantum Realm leads to a movie that feels like a Star Wars prequel. Part of an Ant-Man film’s appeal is seeing the hero interact with objects and environments familiar to us, like a Thomas the Tank Engine toy or a Hello Kitty Pez Dispenser. But with an entirely CGI environment, the superpowers on display lose their X factor and humor. This movie loses every sense of realism that the first two had by taking every scene and filming it in The Volume. Everything feels artificial, with every scene filmed in front of what looks like an LED screen. While the opening few scenes retain a few of the comedic elements the Ant-Man movies are well-known for, we are quickly thrown into a large-scale, high-stakes adventure that throws all character development out of the window. Quantumania‘s only focus is to have an action-packed experience that establishes a big bad who will return in the future. The trailer sold this film on the premise that Scott is regretful of all the years he did not get to be with Cassie, as he did not get to see her grow up. Unfortunately, this element barely exists within the film. While the father-daughter element has always been the heart and soul of the series, this movie only scratches the surface. The characters get sucked into the Quantum Realm because of Cassie’s tinkering with technology, but her motivation for doing this is weak and we never see her regret this. Furthermore, she expertly wields an Ant-Man suit despite never having on-screen training or practice. Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) plays an instrumental role in Quantumania, but she often conceals vital information under the cliché excuse of “I didn’t tell you to protect you.” She’s terrified about the prospect of sending a signal to the Quantum Realm because she knows of the dangers that exist down there. However, this feels like a contradiction of the post-credit scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp, when she confidently helped send Scott to the Quantum Realm, where he stayed for five years. Not only is it inconsistent, but when the movie is so plot-driven, it never slows down to explore the people driving the story forward. Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and Hank (Michael Douglas) are flat, two-dimensional characters. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania also has an issue with its villains. Kang is set to be the MCU’s new big bad after Thanos, following his first appearance in the season 1 finale of Loki. However, for the film’s first hour, he only exists in flashbacks. In the second hour, he takes on a much grander role, where we get a sense of how dangerous and ruthless he is. You get the sense that he is the most powerful villain the Avengers will have to face, although his motivations feel weak. He is a power-hungry villain and not much more, despite Majors’ fantastic performance elevating every scene he is in. But the secondary antagonist is MODOK (Corey Stoll), whose translation from comic book drawings to live-action is hilariously awful. He looks like a joke, acts like a joke, and is often treated like the miscalculation of a character design that he is. MODOK is such a goofy villain that every time he is paired with Kang, it creates a jarring tonal contrast, as we have the MCU’s most terrifying villain matched with their most idiotic. Furthermore, Bill Murray appears in a humorless cameo that feels like he showed up for a day, said a few lines, and collected a paycheck. While the action sequences of the first two Ant-Man films were a highlight because of how they played around with scale, this movie has poorly edited shootouts and does not feature a single standout set piece. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is so filled with visual spectacle that, at some point, it all begins to feel like noise. Although the movie benefits from a strong hero and villain, it feels like such a jarring departure from the first two installments that it loses sight of what makes Ant-Man work. By putting an Avengers-level threat into an Ant-Man film, the charm is gone, and all we’re left with is an emotionally empty barrage of special effects with less of the humor and joy that allowed these movies to shine in the first place. As ComingSoon’s review policy explains, a score of 4 equates to “Poor.” The negatives outweigh the positive aspects making it a struggle to get through. Jonathan Sim is a film critic and filmmaker born and raised in New York City. He has met/interviewed some of the leading figures in Hollywood, including Christopher Nolan, Zendaya, Liam Neeson, and Denis Villeneueve. He also works as a screenwriter, director, and producer on independent short films."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"[Majors] is so quietly charismatic that, no matter how many civilizations Kang destroys, you kinda want him to win."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," That’s the big news in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” and the Quantum Realm is where most of the movie takes place. Yes, there are a few scenes in San Francisco, the home base of Paul Rudd’s amiable size-shifting Marvel superhero, Scott Lang. This is his third go-round, after “Ant-Man” (2015) and “Ant-Man and the Wasp” (2018). But the Quantum Realm is definitely where the action is. Too much of it. Evangeline Lilly, now sporting a nifty punky haircut, also returns. She’s the Wasp, a.k.a. Hope Van Dyne, Scott’s love interest. Both Ant-Man and the Wasp can shrink to bug scale or expand to giant economy size, owing to special suits designed by Hope’s scientist dad, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Hope’s mom, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), is a scientist, too. The challenge in the second movie was getting her sprung from the Quantum Realm (hereafter “QR,” and no code jokes, please), where Janet had been trapped for 30 years. So now the four of them head back there — don’t ask why — along with Scott’s now-teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton, “Big Little Lies”). Much to Scott’s surprise, Cassie has a suit, too. For now, though, she lacks a zippy arthropod moniker. Well, that’s what more sequels are for. The QR poses all kinds of problems for Scott and company. Chief among them is the presence of the villainous Kang the Conqueror. It’s probably unnecessary to call a character named Kang the Conqueror “villainous.” As played by Jonathan Majors (“The Harder They Fall,” “Devotion”), Kang has a mournful majesty that makes his ruthlessness all the more potent. Kang’s easily the most formidable Marvel baddie since Josh Brolin’s Thanos, in the “Avengers” movies. He’s the most menacing, too. The QR poses even more problems for “Ant-Man.” In the realm, the movie becomes as much sci-fi or fantasy feature as superhero outing. The QR is definitely an alternate reality but it’s visually incoherent. (Come to think of it, the story’s basically incoherent, too.) When “Ant-Man” is in San Francisco, it’s a setting viewers know. When a movie presents a different, imagined world — whether it’s Pandora or Dune or Middle-earth or, yes, the QR — it needs to feel whole. Variety is fine. It’s even welcome, but only within some larger coherence. This the QR never has. It’s a hodge-podge of weirdness and coolness. Some of the coolness is quite cool — giant flying manta ray taxis! a telepath whose forehead glows pink! — but too much of it is just CGI that’s all dressed up with too many places to go. Visually, things start out pretty wild in the QR. With “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” emphasis is definitely on the “mania.” For a while, there seems to be a competition going on with “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” (2022) for the title of trippiest Marvel movie. Soon enough the visuals settle into a general biomorphic cheesiness. True, there’s a gleaming futuristic city toward the end of the movie where your basic battle for the future of the multiverse takes place, but said metropolis seems to have wandered in from another movie. Speaking of other movies, this one includes a fairly shameless knock-off of the cantina scene in the first “Star Wars.” That’s OK, since this enables a cameo from a much-loved “SNL” old-timer. Unfortunately, the title characters’ loosey-goosey pals from the first two movies (Michael Peña, David Dastmalchian, and T.I.) are nowhere to be seen. At least Dastmalchian is heard. Providing the voice of a particularly oddball QR denizen, he’s quite amusing. Humor, or its downplaying, is an issue in the QR. Rudd is neck and neck with Robert Downey Jr. for highest quippiness quotient of any Marvel star. The quips are noticeably fewer here, even if this has to be the only superhero movie to have a BabyBjörn joke. Instead of comedy, what takes precedence is implausible, and confusing, plot sorting-out. Of course the BabyBjörn joke might be seen as qualifying as implausible in both categories. Peyton Reed, who directed the first two movies with a nicely light touch, goes the bombast route here. Or maybe he’s just trying to distract the audience from the holes in Jeff Loveness’s script. Where, exactly, did that ant army come from? There’s another possibility, though it’s so unthinkable one hesitates to bring it up. Is superhero-osity finally exceeding its shelf life? I know, I know, that sounds ridiculous, but think of how ridiculous a similar question about westerns would have sounded, circa 1955. So just to be on the safe side, let’s leave the final word on such speculation to an expert, Mr. Kang the Conqueror. When Ant-Man threatens him with retaliation from the Avengers, Kang shrugs. He’s killed “many” of them, he says. Which ones, an angry Ant-Man wants to know. Kang shrugs again. “They all blur together after a while.”"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania is the weakest entry point to begin a new phase of the MCU&#46; 
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE," Marvel has been a little bit lost in the weeds since “Avengers: Endgame.” In all the movies that came before, there was a sense of urgency and purpose that every subsequent film was building towards something. Since then, a few standouts aside (I see you “Shang-Chi”), the movies and television shows produced by Marvel have been average at best without much purpose or direction. Their most bankable heroes are either not coming back or are scattered to the wind. The good news is that it appears that Marvel is finally back on track with “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” it’s just that they probably picked the wrong movie to put things in order. Ant-Man has always existed at the sillier end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, getting by on Paul Rudd’s pluck and charm as Scott Lang, the petty crook turned superhero. The action is kicked off when a lab accident sends Scott, Cassie, Scott’s girlfriend and fellow superhero Hope Van Dyne, aka the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), OG Ant-Man Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) into the subatomic Quantum Realm. Janet spent 30 years trapped in the Quantum Realm, so she knows her way around, but the rest of the crew are amazed and bewildered by the wildly-strange creatures they encounter in this microscopic universe. It is here where we meet Marvel’s new big bad in Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a universe-hopping warlord who rules the Quantum Realm with an iron fist and looks to expand his empire across the multiverse. While stopping Kang and freeing the good citizens of the Quantum Realm is the main goal in “Quantumania,” I enjoyed this movie’s willingness to let its freak-flag fly. I love super-weird sci-fi (I’ll see your “Fifth Element” and raise you “Buckaroo Banzai”), so I am here for it, but I also respect the fact that it’s not everyone’s cup of tea and that the zaniness of the Quantum Realm may not be the right place to set the emotional stakes for the next dozen movies or so. At any rate, I was thoroughly entertained and Majors proves he is more than up to the task of menacing the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the foreseeable future. Also, the two-hour runtime feels brief and refreshing compared to some of Marvel’s more recent efforts. The future of the MCU is as uncertain as ever, but “Quantumania” has the train back up on the tracks and (hopefully) headed in the right direction."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (Estados Unidos, 2023). Dirección: Peyton Reed. Guion: Jeff Loveness. Fotografía: Bill Pope. Música: Christophe Beck. Edición: Laura Jennings y Adam Gerstel. Elenco: Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Jonathan Majors, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton, Corey Stoll, Michael Douglas. Duración: 125 minutos. Distribuidora: Buena Vista. Calificación: Solo apta para mayores de 13 años. Nuestra opinión: regular. Ant Man protagonizó en 2015 y 2018 dos de las más espléndidas y felices aventuras de toda la historia de Marvel en el cine. Imposible olvidarlo. En ellas, el diminuto personaje se volvía realmente grande por razones que no tenían tanto que ver con sus superpoderes. Pero en esta tercera película propia se impone una paradoja: en un momento contemplamos la versión más gigantesca posible de nuestro héroe, aunque esa exhibición tan colosal lo reduce a la mínima expresión. A Ant Man (o a Scott Lang, su nombre en el mundo real) esta vez no le creemos nada. De nuevo habrá que echarle la culpa de este retroceso a la idea del “multiverso” que recorre toda la actualidad y el futuro de Marvel. Las dos películas previas (Ant Man: el hombre hormiga y Ant Man and the Wasp) eran enormes comedias en las que Lang (Paul Rudd) usaba su pasado de ladrón para entrar casi en puntas de pie al universo de los Avengers mientras construía una nueva familia. Ahora todo es mucho más serio, denso, recargado e “importante”. Y Ant Man, que al principio de Quantumania parecía una reliquia de las etapas previas de Marvel, capaz hasta de escribir su propia autobiografía, se convierte en el simple vector de la siguiente fase del universo cinematográfico del estudio. Una mera herramienta al servicio de otros fines. En esta transición, Ant Man renuncia a casi todas sus virtudes. Literalmente abandona su mundo para entrar a la fuerza en otro, completamente ajeno. Su presencia está ahora condicionada por las necesidades del estudio, cuya prioridad es la presentación en sociedad del villano estelar de los próximos tiempos, Kang el Conquistador (Jonathan Majors) y llevarnos de nuevo al terreno del dichoso “multiverso”. En la búsqueda de esos objetivos, Marvel sacrifica por completo el espíritu ligero y alegre de las aventuras previas creado por Peyton Reed, un gran director de comedias que aquí cambia de piel. Sus marcas de autor desaparecen detrás de un guion rutinario y, sobre todo, completamente falto de gracia. Quantumania es un relato de pura ciencia ficción (más que en cualquier otra película previa de Marvel, aunque parezca mentira) ambientado en mundos extraños que muestran demasiados parecidos con los de Star Wars. Todo es demasiado espeso en el Reino Cuántico, el universo paralelo en el que Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) estuvo confinada 30 años y al que vuelve tras un exceso de confianza de la ya crecida hija de Lang, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). A Lang le toca una vez más preservar el equilibrio familiar, ahora amenazado por un enorme descuido. Y cuando aparece Kang, el equivalente a Thanos en la división del trabajo planificada por Marvel para su nueva fase, las cosas se complican todavía más. Con un tono mucho más grave, sombrío y aterrador. Así lo sugiere a primera vista el diseño visual del Reino Cuántico, un lugar que por su diseño tranquilamente podría ser visto como el Lado Oscuro del universo de Marvel. Casi toda la acción de Quantumania transcurre en ese escenario opaco y muy ruidoso. En medio de semejante demostración de poderío digital no hay mucho lugar para las muestras de humanidad. Por allí vemos a Rudd mostrando en cuentagotas su inmenso talento de comediante, a Pfeiffer luciendo su madura belleza y a Michael Douglas, como siempre, divirtiéndose un poco más que el resto. Se extraña muchísimo la ausencia de grandes personajes secundarios (como el Luis de Michael Peña y el Paxton de Bobby Cannavale), lúcidos exponentes del espíritu de comedia familiar que supimos disfrutar en los films previos. Aquí, la brújula aparece tan extraviada que la Wasp de Evangeline Lilly pasa casi inadvertida y hasta la fugaz aparición de Bill Murray, que en el contexto de las películas previas hubiese sido muy celebrada, no funciona ni siquiera como curiosidad. Del otro lado está Kang, un personaje vital para el futuro de Marvel, expuesto desde ahora y en sus próximas aventuras a padecer los caprichosos giros del “multiverso”. Majors, un excelente actor, por momentos se las ingenia para dibujar a este villano como un ser temible e inquietante desde su actitud calma y desdeñosa. Nos queda como consuelo de lo que pudo ser ese par de pequeñas y simétricas escenas en el mundo real como muestras de la despreocupación con que Scott Lang encara la nueva etapa de su vida. Es la única (y magra) conexión visible entre el universo previo de Ant Man y esta nueva aventura que ya no divierte como las anteriores, y en el fondo funciona para Marvel solo como un entretenimiento de manual, con más músculo que ingenio. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE," 
It's a worry that has plagued the Marvel Cinematic Universe since Iron Man: When would the franchise jump the rails? Well, arguably that happened with Phase 4, the post-Infinity Saga stories meant to wrap up the first big arc of the series and launch a new era of heroes. The TV side of things on Disney+, such as Loki and WandaVision, ended up being some of the best-received entries in the massive enterprise, while films like Eternals landed with a damp thud.
 
So now the question is, can the littlest superhero get the film side of things back on track? The answer, as provided by Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, is a giant-sized yes, as Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly return to not only seemingly wrap up the story of Scott Lang, the petty thief turned Avenger, but also hurl headfirst into Phase 5 and the upcoming multiversal menace of Kang the Conqueror.
 
Quantumania, the third movie about Rudd's jovial if panicked hero, is really a family affair: He and techno-philanthropist Hope van Dyne (Lilly), his daughter, Cassie (Newton), and van Dyne's reunited parents, Hank Pym (the delightfully eccentric Douglas) and Janet van Dyne (a suitably enigmatic Pfeiffer), are all reunited in San Francisco, even if there are rumblings of dysfunction underneath it all. Superficially, it's with the daddy-daughter issues between Scott and Cassie, who is constantly irked that her hero dad seems to have fallen out of the hero business, but it's really about what happened to Janet in those 30 years in which she was trapped in the subatomic Quantum Realm, and exactly what â or rather, who â she was there with: Kang (Majors, simmering with animosity and ambition), whose machinations bring the whole family into his infinitesimal empire.
 
Quantumania is, quite frankly, everything that Taika Waititi's dismal run on Thor (the continuity-dismissive Ragnarok and the infuriating Love and Thunder) was not. Director Peyton Reed returns a genuine sense of cosmic wonder that has been lacking from recent Marvel movies, crafting a bizarre and physics-defying Quantum Realm that gorgeously melds the mechanical and the biological in fun, gooey ways (""Drink the slime!""). He introduces a panoply of exotic new species, residents of this subatomic realm that pulsate and fluoresce, scarcely recognizable as life forms but so very alive. Indeed, this version of the Quantum Realm may be the most enthralling and immersive addition to sci-fi habitats since George Lucas first took us to the city-planet of Coruscant, a place that feels like it exists beyond the confines of the frame.
 
But, most importantly, Quantumania holds two raw emotions: love and terror. Love in the form of the dysfunctional extended Ant-family, an idiosyncratic bunch who you genuinely feel would lay everything on the line for each other. And terror in the brutal, manipulative, murderous intent of Majors as Kang. When the time-traveling dictator was first announced as the new big bad of the MCU, there was a ripple of concern. After all, his backstory in the comics is such a convoluted mishmash of incarnations, variants, and alter egos that it's often unclear if the writers know who he is. But there's a clear focus here, established by scriptwriter Jeff Loveness and building upon Michael Waldron's development of the character in the Loki series for Disney+. That's where we first saw Majors, but not as Kang. There he was He Who Remains, a variant of Kang manipulating the multiverse in his role as the lesser evil. But this Kang is the greater evil, Kang the Conqueror, a perfect fusion of sadism and megalomania, tempered with a taste for manipulation and cruelty. Evil rolls off Majors' performance in waves, making him an apt successor to and utterly distinct from the equally genocidal Thanos: After all, the Mad Titan saw himself as a benevolent force for good, but this Kang has bloody, bloody hands and likes that ferric smell.
 
And that's exactly why it's such a genius move to place him in pitched battle against the MCU's biggest putz. Rudd's take on Scott Lang has always been rooted in his firm belief that, at some point, he's going to get found out. It's Rudd's easy, slightly panicked charm that makes Quantumania work, just as much as Majors' malice, even if they're clearly imbalanced in powers. The MCU has never been shy about killing off major characters, and as it really embraces the post-Iron Man, post-Captain America, post-Thor era, there's a real feeling that Kang's menacing ways could make it the post-Ant-Man era. Quantumania goes big, but it never forgets that Ant-Man is our guy.

"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE," The latest installment in the Marvel franchise never takes flight despite its hard-working cast, led by Paul Rudd and a new villain played by Jonathan Majors. Busy, noisy and thoroughly uninspired, “Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is the latest, though doubtless not the last, installment in a Marvel franchise that took unsteady flight in 2015. Simply titled “Ant-Man,” that first movie was two hours of nonsense and branding, and disappointing enough to suggest that the character would be more farm-team material than A-lister. Given Marvel’s own superpowers, though, the movie turned out to be a hit, ensuring that the buggy guy would dart around for a while. Three years later, the agreeably buoyant sequel “Ant-Man and the Wasp” followed, and was an even greater success. “Quantumania” will most likely vacuum up yet more cash, partly because there’s not much else shiny and new in theaters now, never mind that this movie isn’t especially new or shiny. A hash of recycled ideas and schtick, it borrows from Frank Herbert’s “Dune,” the “Star Wars” cycle and Marvel’s own annals and largely serves as a launching pad for a new villain, Kang (Jonathan Majors). Once again, after some perfunctory table-setting, Ant-Man a.k.a. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and his brainiac romantic partner, Hope Van Dyne a.k.a. the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), suit up, flying high and zipping low to save their family and the world amid quips, the usual obstacles and household drama. (Kathryn Newton plays the Ant kid.) Directed by Peyton Reed from Jeff Loveness’s barely-there script (the first movies each had multiple writers), “Quantumania” bops along innocuously at first, buoyed by the charm and professionalism of its performers and by your narrative expectations. Something is going to happen. After some jokey blather and reintroductions (hello again, Michael Douglas), it does, and once again Ant-Man et al. are sucked into the so-called Quantum Realm, a woo-woo alternative universe filled with swirls of color and looming threats. It’s there that Hope’s mother, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), as you’re laboriously reminded, spent many enigmatic years and where, after the some narrative delay, the mysteries of that adventure are revealed. The Realm features darkly ominous hues, fractal shapes, biomorphic organisms, streams of fire and strange beings, including Bill Murray, as a lord, who briefly drifts in on the vapors of his celebrity and flirts with Pfeiffer before drifting out to cash his paycheck. Murray notwithstanding, there are enough attractions to keep your eyes engaged, and the creature design is fairly witty. It isn’t pretty; the palette runs toward dun and dull red with slashes of marine blue. But it is diverting to see how movies realize alternative realities, and at least some of the C.G.I. wizards here — who do yeoman’s work in movies like “Quantumania” — seem to have spent time studying the deep-space images captured by the Hubble Telescope.

"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE," Así como Taika Waititi nos hizo recordar en Thor: Amor y trueno el año pasado que las películas de Marvel debían ser divertidas, además de aventuras colosales con villanos de toda índole, el director Peyton Reed en Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania toma el relevo y multiplica la apuesta, exprimiendo lo mejor como comediante de Paul Rudd como el protagonista, Scott Lang.  Ni la primera ni la segunda de Ant-Man eran lo que se podría decir grandes aventuras. Aquí el giro es casi total, porque sigue siendo, de las sagas interconectadas de Marvel, la más virada a la comedia, pero de las tres Ant-Man es la más divertida, la mejor realizada, la más concisa y una en la que verdaderamente podemos preocuparnos por la vida de los personajes.  Con este filme se inicia la Fase 5 del Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel, por lo que es la puntada inicial de lo que vendrá. Pero a no preocuparse porque la historia creada por el exguionista de Jimmy Kimmel Live, Jeff Loveness, que hace su debut en el cine, se preocupa mucho mas -y lo bien que hace- en que la trama tenga peso propio e independiente y sí, disemina por allí lo que vendrá a futuro.  Aquellos que vieron Loki, la serie spin-off en Disney+, ya conocen a Kang, el Conquistador (Jonathan Majors, de Lovecraft Country y a quien veremos en Creed III). Es un genocida cósmico, y además, megalómano. Puede viajar y destruir cualquier hilo del multiverso. Y es más que el villano de turno, un personaje siniestro, pero al que vamos a ver durante muchas más películas, una aseveración que no se sostiene únicamente con una de las dos escenas postcréditos que tiene el filme...  La mayor parte de la proyección de Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania transcurre en el reino cuántico -un universo más que un mundo, porque contiene varios-, subatómico y mutante, que existe fuera de nuestro espacio-tiempo, y que es aquel en el que Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) estuvo por 30 años y del que era rescatada por su familia en Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018). ¿Cómo llegan al reino cuántico? La hija activista y prodigio de la ciencia de Scott, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), construyó ayudada por Hank Pym (Michael Douglas, esposo de Janet y padre de Hope -Evangeline Lily)- una suerte de metatelescopio en el sótano de la casa. Con él, pueden mapear el reino cuántico, pero alguien dentro de ese reino utiliza esa señal para succionar a los 5 personajes, que van a aparar ahí, al reino cuántico.  Visualmente es como ver las portadas de los discos psicodélicos de rock. Hay bosques, polillas, soles con tentáculos, un personaje que parece un brócoli, esculturas de gelatina que se desplazan. Y están los rebeldes, empobrecidos, que quieren luchar contra Kang.  En eso, Quantamania se parece a cualquiera de las películas de Star Wars, en las que los buenos están en pugna con un dictador, sea Darth Vader o Kang.  Janet estaba allí hace años, cuando Kang llegó, exiliado, e hizo estallar el núcleo del dispositivo cuántico de Kang, para que éste no pudiera escapar. Ahora, si puede conseguir algunas Partículas Pym, las que permiten a Ant-Man y Wasp encogerse al tamaño de un insecto o crecer como gigantes, tendrá una salida. Lo que vale aquí es el humor, el balanceo entre aventuras y gags, y una historia que no decae nunca en su poco más de dos horas, contando créditos y las dos escenas postcrédito.  También está Bill Murray, como un ex rebelde que ahora trabaja para Kang, y que en su momento tuvo algo que ver con Janet, de manera íntima. Y está Darren (Corey Stoll), que en la primera Ant-Man (lo muestran para los que no lo recuerden) era el malvado corporativo. Bueno, está algo distinto, tiene la forma de M.O.D.O.K., una cabeza enorme y malévola envuelta en una armadura de hojalata con manitos y piernitas de nene.  Acción/Comedia.

"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE," Ever since Endgame, the Marvel machine has seen its meticulously-plotted designs start to come apart at the seams. The latest to grind its wheels forward in this shared universe is Peyton Reed’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and let me tell you: it’s not good folks. It is very, very not good. Throughout 31 (!!!) films and a handful of other Disney+ tie-in shows and special presentation one-offs, the MCU has delivered its fair share of highs and lows but never before has it unleashed such an objectively terrible content clunker. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is Marvel’s worst yet, seriously putting into question this critic’s commitment to keeping up with this increasingly disjointed and time-consuming franchise.  The plot, as written by Rick and Morty staff-writer Jeff Loveness, is as barren as an MCU entry has ever dared to be. After being stuck in the quantum realm for much of his daughter’s coming-of-age, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) feels he needs to be a more active father. His daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has followed in her old man’s footsteps, engaging in grassroots social justice issues that land her in the slammer. In her spare time, she’s also created her own ant-man suit. Because why not. When Cassie crafts a beacon to map out the quantum realm where Janet Dan Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) spent 30 solitary years, she accidentally opens a rift that sucks her, Scott, Janet,  Hope (Evangeline Lilly), and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) in. This all happens in the first fifteen minutes or so. Devoid of a traditional three act structure, Quantumania is a one-note riff that’s essentially Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves on extra tiny mode. Diminished to subatomic size, Scott and his family discover that there is a secret society in the quantum realm populated by strange creatures. A society that Janet had kept quiet for her own reasons. One thing becomes quickly clear: the entirety of this microscopic world lives in fear of Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors), Marvel’s next big bad. The crux of Quantumania centers around introducing Major’s Kang, though it doesn’t really explore the character in greater depth than Loki’s final episode already did. This is basically a hat on a hat; a way to ensure that those not subscribed to Disney+ know that Kang is a big deal going forward. Even though they’ve already told us this before. As such, Quantumania feels like a massive waste of time. It’s two hours of uncreative, bloodless, stake-free battles, unconvincing CGI, and incredibly lame dialogue. As in this is likely the worst script that’s ever been in an MCU movie. In his past iterations, the Ant-Man MCU entires got by on scrappiness, spunk, and a good sense of humor – but that’s all missing here. Ant-Man has worked by virtue of his relatively small role in the larger MCU and trying to make this entry a major pivot point for the entirety of the MCU doesn’t work at all. For whatever reason, the attempts at humor are less convincing than they’ve ever been. The jokes all land with a thud while the attempt to inject a more serious nature into this corner of the universe just doesn’t work. This is doubly true with Reed at the helm who seems to lack an understanding of tone and story momentum and can’t balance it all together into a cohesive whole. Although Majors is a talented addition to the MCU, even his turn here feels like one-note grandstanding. He’s all doom and gloom and inevitability, bringing a sense of gravity to the role that just doesn’t fit in against the otherwise mushy lack of consequence that defines Reed’s world. As a purely visual venture, so too is Quantumania a bizarre failure. Despite some original creature designs and a color-blasted cinematography from Bill Pope, Reed’s basic sense for composition is thrown into serious doubt early on and can never recover. Every shot looks like an actor standing around on a sound stage because every shot is an actor standing around on a sound stage. There’s a sense of sameness to the action choreography and blocking that makes every frame look so drab and dull and repetitive. The set pieces are entirely CGI creations and fail to amaze or impress on a technical or emotional level. There’s nothing innovative or even inviting here making this truly the worst all around effort that Marvel has cranked out. Digital effect workhorses invest countless hours into creating the otherworldly sets and cosmic backdrops but they can’t bring formally frigid filmmaking to life.   The cast itself is a mixed bag. Pfeiffer deservingly gets the bulk of the dramatic heavy lifting while Douglas is minimized to ant-based comic relief. Rudd tries his best but ultimately fails to justify why Ant-Man was needed back for another solo venture. Newton is an okay addition though there’s so little for her to do other than act as a damsel in distress for Scott’s arc. The biggest shocker is Lilly, who despite getting second billing gets less screen time than any of the aforementioned characters. When it comes down to it though, this is for the best as the actress delivers an almost offensively phone-it-in performance whenever she is onscreen. The supporting cast, which includes Bill Murray, David Dastmalchian, Katy M. O’Brian, and William Jackson Harper, serve their purpose of occupying time though none makes much of an impression. The biggest problem here is just that there are so many problems. And the problems are mostly Giant-Man-sized. The direction is uninspired and lifeless. The script is downright awful. The comedy is derelict, with the script resorting over and over again to poking fun of itself and just how lazy and dumb everything is as well as how ridiculous the larger MCU is. Major characters change their motivation because of throwaway one-liners. There’s no sense momentum or overall plot progression. The visual effects are just downright bad in way too many instances. Marvel has had mixed bags and failings throughout their oeuvre thus far but it’s hard to minimize just how terrible everything about Quantumania is. If this is what we can expect from the future of the MCU, you can find me in the timeline where I stop following along. CONCLUSION: ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’ is bereft of plot, humor, and meaning: a cloying journey into teeny tiny stakes that only amplifies how rudderless the MCU has become in its multiverse era. The worst MCU entry to date.  When not plugging away at his computer, Matt can be found holed up in his Seattle home or hidden amongst the mountains.

"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," When discussing the third chapter in the “Ant-Man” series, director Peyton Reed emphasizes the “family” dynamic. Assigning “Quantumania” a wholesome moniker is a big red flag, an attempted excuse for the movie’s utter mediocrity. This wacky, terribly uneven, and often nonsensical movie places Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in peril. But in a way, this limp adventure leaves plenty of room to grow. Just where the improvement goes is uncertain, especially when Marvel Studios and Disney have erected a built-in reset button—the metaverse. “Quantumania” takes Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Scott’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), and Hope’s parents, Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), to a subatomic universe. Their improbable descent into a tiny, tiny world is reminiscent of another Disney family film, 1989’s “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.” “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids” didn’t have the pressure of a multi-billion-dollar franchise hanging over it. The family-friendly PG rating helped broaden that picture’s appeal pushing it to more than $222 million in worldwide box office. The skilled special effects artists’ work on “Shrunk” with miniatures and stop-motion effects holds up pretty well today. Those small models had texture and weight, which is seriously lacking visually and narratively in “Quantumania.” But it’s the concept of the metaverse that nagged at me as I drove home from the press screening on Monday night. It’s a crazy and inspiring science fiction idea that’s everywhere right now and served as a crucial plot component for the aptly named Oscar-nominated “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” But as the theory develops in the MCU, it’s become a crutch to explain away missteps and faulty casting choices and to eliminate entire films from the canon that, for one reason or another, failed to move the Marvel ball forward. Constant in-jokes are often employed to help to soften the quantum leaps from one actor to another and from one failure to another success. At some point, the jokes only accentuate the schmaltziness of the entire enterprise. But in the notion of a metaverse, Marvel and Disney found their saving grace; everything and everyone can co-exist. In “Quantumania,” the subatomic and the metaverse are blurred confusingly with lots of talk but very little of it intelligible. However, the abuse of the metaverse conceit will be an MCU touchstone moving into Phase 5. If the future entries are as weak as this one, the franchise’s theatrical experience will yield less and less with each installment. Ironically, this big blockbuster slice of “Ant-Man” reminds viewers of the inherent limitation to the comic book movie empire that Disney now shepherds. Bigger isn’t necessarily better. And maybe the MCU is more suited for a smaller screen that is less cinematic and more televisual. The bright spot in “Quantumania” is the gifted Jonathan Majors, an actor on the rise and will next play the boxing nemesis in the March release “Creed III.” But in this ludicrous movie, his considerable talents are almost out of place. Majors delivers a handsome, mature performance as the murderous Kang the Conqueror. He’s a lonely, vicious killer leaving a high body count in his wake. Sadly, the seriousness that Majors conveys is met with a juvenile narrative and jokey supporting roles that undermine his somewhat Shakespearian approach. To say Majors acts circles around his co-stars is an understatement. The tonal shifts from Kang’s dreary and mysterious but engrossing motivations to Scott Lang’s comic quips might give you whiplash. Perhaps, a funnier villain would have helped maintain a sense of balance. And Majors could be comedic, I’m sure. Also problematic is that “Quantumania” is bathed almost entirely in animated computer-generated effects. The CGI looks intentionally goofy, featuring silly characters that reminded me of those in the Wachowski misfire “Jupiter Ascending.” The look of the world built for Ant-Man, the Wasp, and Kang feels dated and weightless, even fake, compared to “Avatar: The Way of Water.” It’s a shame that the MCU has to compete in the same marketplace with the ultimate cinematic experience that’s been burning up the box office for weeks and weeks. But where “The Way of Water” has visual panache like nothing else in theaters, its story comes up short. If the narrative of a movie is engaging and credible, viewers will excuse junky effects. And the MCU has plenty of goodwill in the story department. Unfortunately, “Quantumania” gets bogged down with heady metaverse and subatomic mumbo jumbo, not much of which grabbed me emotionally. And in this film centered on a family in extreme jeopardy, Scott Lang, Cassie, and the Van Dynes are fairly nonchalant about their predicament. Since they aren’t particularly shaken by being shrunk to the size of a subatomic particle, why should we care? And once they are zapped into a subatomic world, they continue to bicker and joke. The stream of insincere and leaden one-liners is supposed to be fun, but that superficial tone undercuts any sense of risk they face. The jokey attitude extends to Kang’s menacing chief henchman, the freaky flying head M.O.D.O.K. In this universe, M.O.D.O.K. is voiced by Corey Stoll, who played the bad guy in the first “Ant-Man” outing. While Stoll is perfectly fine as the troubled floating exaggerated all-head killer, I’m more partial to the performance of the character by Patton Oswalt in the animated HULU television series. Of course, Marvel has the metaverse device available to magically explain away that version of M.O.D.O.K., which will perpetuate an endless redundant, lazy cycle of diminishing returns. Other supporting performances contribute to the rolling chuckle fest. “The Good Place” star William Jackson Harper plays a mind-reader, and he has fun with those abilities. But the Quantum Realm, as it is called in the film, is so odd and lacking in any definition that I was left frustrated by his humanoid appearance alongside bizarre creatures. For example, we get a comical gelatinous dude and a guy with what appears to be broccoli as a head. Why is there a mixture of human-looking folks and phantasmagoric characters in this subatomic land? This inconsistency is an exasperating plot hole. Bill Murray appears briefly and hints at the foolishness of it all but leaves us hanging with more questions when the script should be providing, at least, a few grounded answers. Instead of giving us a wondrous hidden world with definite rules that we can relate to, “Quantumania” expects us to accept the weirdness on its face. But the strangeness overwhelms the core emotional story elements, and the effects don’t measure up to the “Avatar” bar. What you get is second-tier visuals constructed around a weedy narrative. There’s as much pathos in the colorful, wacky-looking movie Robert Rodriguez’s 2005 flick “The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D.” There’s no doubt that Marvel superfans will apologize for “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” by explaining that the “Ant-Man” movies were always the weaker family-friendly entries in the MCU. But if this movie were better, that double-talk wouldn’t be necessary. It’s possible to make a family-friendly comic book adventure that’s also a good film. Unfortunately, this blockbuster release makes the small-screen streaming serialized superheroes look bigger than their theatrical counterparts."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE," Algo no anda bien en Marvel Studios. La chispa, la emoción, la… “magia”, ya no está ahí, al menos para este servidor, quien -aunque algunos con memoria corta no lo recordarán- fue un aliado hasta hace relativamente poco. El MCU no ha sido el mismo desde Avengers: Endgame. La mayoría de sus fans -incluso los más devotos- lo saben, aunque no quieran admitirlo. Estos nos dicen que “es que tienen que tener paciencia, están haciendo el “set-up” pa’ lo que viene en camino, el próximo evento”, pero la veintena de largometrajes que precedieron la llegada de “Thanos”, no todos habrán sido memorables, pero al menos entretenían y funcionaban, tanto por sí solos, como parte de un todo. Más importante aún: tenían carácter propio. Los filmes de Captain America evocaban los dramas militares o de espionaje; los de Thor eran tontitos, operáticos y divertidos; Guardians of the Galaxy se caracterizaron por su actitud rebelde; mientras que los de Ant-Man, no habrán sido los más ambiciosos, pero eso era parte de su encanto, su combinación de apuestas bajas y comedia amena, dos cualidades de las que apenas hay rastro en Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. La tercera aventura del superhéroe ha sido seleccionada como la encargada de iniciar la llamada 5ta Fase del MCU. Esto significa que ya no puede seguir su propia línea, sino que ahora tiene que servir como la introducción a lo que -según nos aseguran los fans- será el próximo gran evento, llamado Secret Wars, una “épica” guerra entre los multiversos, concepto teórico que, narrativamente, no podría ser más contraproducente a trazar un sólido arco dramático, pues las consecuencias son prácticamente nulas. El principal antagonista de esa nueva hecatombe cósmica lo es “Kang the Conqueror”, a quien conocimos brevemente en la serie de Loki (o, al menos, una variante de él), y quien aquí vuelve a ser interpretado por Jonathan Majors, uno de los actores más calientes del momento, talentoso por demás. Sin embargo, se suele decir que las primeras impresiones son muy importantes, y si este va a ser el próximo gran villano del MCU, “Kang” deja mucho que desear. El pobre desarrollo de “Kang” no es el único problema de Quantumania, pero ciertamente es el más significativo y el principal culpable de que el resto de la película resulte tan banal, pues su única razón de ser es convencernos que este tipo es la nueva amenaza, algo que no hace satisfactoriamente. Peor aún, sin entrar en spoilers, una de las escenas post-créditos convierte todo lo que acabamos de ver en una gran pérdida de tiempo. Ese es el problema de los multiversos: nada importa, no hay reglas, las pocas que hay se reescriben a conveniencia y todo es fácilmente reemplazable/remediable. Majors no tiene mucho con qué trabajar más allá de un disfraz llamativo y extremadamente fiel a las páginas de los cómics, pero su personaje carece de un claro propósito para querer conquistar y destruir universos. Por más irracionales que sean las motivaciones de un villano, para el espectador es vital conocerlas y entenderlas. Es una de las razones por la que “Thanos” resonó con el público. ¿Y qué del resto de los personajes? Meros pasajeros en su propia serie, con sus intérpretes notablemente desilusionados por la experiencia de tener que filmar el 97% de sus escenas frente a una pantalla verde, con indistinguibles y genéricos efectos especiales de fondo. Su tedio es evidente, incluso contagioso, y trasciende la pantalla. Uno esperaría, mínimo, algo de comedia de unas películas que hasta ahora habían sido bastante graciosas (el verdadero mayor pecado de la producción es no haber traído de vuelta a Michael Peña), pero ni el tremendo Paul Rudd parece estar comprometido con esta historia que lleva a “Scott Lang” y su familia de vuelta al universo subatómico conocido como el “Quantum Realm”. Allí se dividen en dos grupos -“Scott” y su hija, “Cassie” (Kathryn Newton), en uno, y “Janet Van Dyne” (Michelle Pfeiffer), “Hank Pym” (Michael Douglas) y “Hope” (Evangeline Lilly), en otro- y se encuentran con que “Kang” ha conquistado este mundo, por lo que unen esfuerzos con otros seres para liberarlo. Pfeiffer es quien mejor queda parada, y con mayor tiempo en pantalla que en la cinta anterior, pero en general nadie cuenta con buen material en esta ocasión. Como prólogo a Secret Wars -filme que no veremos hasta mayo 2026-, Quantumania no es Iron Man (2008) ni mucho menos The Avengers (2012). Es más bien el primer episodio de una nueva temporada de televisión (de esas que los fans te aseguran “síguela viendo que en el octavo episodio se va a poner buena”), un capítulo inicial que no consigue introducir con aplomo ni a los personajes ni lo que está en juego para el resto del universo, y mientras bien es cierto que aún quedan más de tres años y varios filmes y shows para construir un argumento, lo que se ofrece aquí son meras migajas, lo que denota una vagancia de parte de Marvel. ¿Recuerdan cómo el estudio nos vendió efectivamente la idea de “Thanos” por años a través de escenitas en los créditos? ¿Y luego cómo cumplió todas esas promesas en Infinity War? Pues esta película es una escena post-créditos de dos horas de duración, solo que, contrario a las que duran 45 segundos, esta no deja a uno anticipando la próxima entrega."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The fun comes with Pfeiffer and the nonsense physics, the bubblegum vibe and Rudd’s fail-safe deadpan. The blockbuster fight scenes that were once every Marvel film’s centerpiece are throwaway. That much makes this an odd entry to the studio’s world..."

"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE," Director Peyton Reed stuffs the Quantum Realm with so much razzle-dazzle special effects, super powers, and bells and whistles that some of the characters and the story get lost. Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, but this is not a giant of an MCU production.  The outrageous denizens of the Quantum Realm seem reminiscent of the Star Wars cantina on steroids. There are manta-ray moths, suns with tentacles, giant walking stalks of broccoli, and a jello-esque creature, which is actually a cute character. Everything is lit up to become a dark world of constant glowing neon. There is so much going on all at once, it’s confusing stylistically, visually and, consequently, the plot suffers.  Once again, Rudd plays the likable Ant-Man with power to change size at will. In the original Ant-Man, it took 30 years to get into the Quantum Realm to save scientist Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). In this script, it takes less time than getting into a Starbucks at 8am.  When Scott’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) whips up a device with Grandfather/scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the whole family are surprisingly sucked there in seconds without warning. Being brought back  provides background on what Janet was up to during those three decades including encountering a ludicrous Lord Krylar (Bill Murray). Murray plays his role so casually and with such disdain, it looks like he was just there for one scene and a paycheck.  They also get greeted by Darren (Corey Stoll) who brings evil humor to the film. A corporate baddie from the first film, they thought he was dead. He was reconstructed as M.O.D.O.K., a Mechanized Organism Designed for Killing. Stoll looks so very strange. He’s a face in little gold skull with teeny arms and legs. The aspect ratio and the distortion of his face looks like a bad VHS playback. He’s always gleefully evil. Now Darren is working for the ultimate baddie, Kang. They all know each other from the past.  These films rise and fall with the villains. Thanos was a great one because he really stirred the pot and had a mission for his killing. Kang (Jonathan Majors) is a conqueror who wants to control every timeline in the multiverse. He’s wants to be all powerful. Kang was exiled into the Quantum Realm and took it over as an ultimate despot using a menacing stare and a quiet voice threatening complete extinction. You’ll be seeing more of him in upcoming MCU movies, but we hope grows to fully develop this character.  Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet is really the second lead. She comes up with the major solutions to every situation. She looks fabulous which may be the result of liberal use of de-aging special effects software. Spunky young science wizard Cassie (Newton) emerges as a smart character always ready to spring into action. She’s cute, perky and engaging showing Scott she’s more than Daddy’s little girl.  Where we think this film misses the mark is that the story is hard to follow, muddled, and feels like it’s simply a promo for the Marvel movies to follow. The effects are so overblown that there’s nothing that feels authentic in the Quantum Realm. And we miss the smart, sassy humor that should be the hallmark of the movies in this franchise. We had to work too hard to get through the mania of this realm. "
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," There
may come a time in the future of the so-called Marvel Cinematic Universe, after
it might have become the Marvel All-Media Universe, when we look back on Ant-Man
and the Wasp: Quantumania as some very quaint thing in the history of this
franchise. Here, we get a movie that's just as much an excuse to establish a
forthcoming threat in this particular thread of the overarching narrative of
this current phase or sequence or whatever they want to call it, as well as to
set up the next season of one of the studio's multiple television shows, as it
is to give us an adventure featuring the title characters. All of
this has become the norm for these movies, and the good news is that one doesn't
need to have watched all or any of the Marvel TV series to understand what's
going on in this movie installment. Oh, it would be a benefit, to be sure, but
screenwriter Jeff Loveness at least fills in the blanks for any audience members
who might find themselves behind on the television shows. One gets the feeling
this won't be a benefit granted to us in the near future, so let's appreciate it
while we can. It is,
though, becoming increasingly difficult to appreciate these movies as
individual pieces of media and narrative. As of late, the enterprise has become
more of a take-what-you-can-get-while-you-can-still-get-it endeavor than
anything else. Some of the installments take risks in terms of tone and
narrative scope. Others still feel bogged down by introducing us to a new hero
or a batch of them with the usual formula, and there's always some sense that
we're supposed to be looking for the connective tissue that binds this new
sequence of movies and TV programs together. When it
doesn't arrive, there's some sense of a letdown, and is that really where we're
at with the biggest media franchise likely in the entire history of
entertainment? It's disappointing when the stories aren't allowed to be
self-contained, and it's just as disappointing when the teases toward some big
narrative arc are left only as teases. All of
this isn't to say much about the newest adventure of Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, aka
Scott Lang, and his greatly reduced (not a pun about size but a note about
screen time) sidekick, Evangeline Lilly's Wasp/Hope Van Dyne, and that's part of
the problem here. There simply isn't too much to say about Ant-Man, the Wasp,
and their cohortshis daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who now wears a
size-shifting costume, and her parents (played by Michael Douglas and Michelle
Pfeiffer). In the amusing introduction, we learn that Scott has let the fame of
helping to save the world go to his head, but soon enough, the quintet is sucked
through a contraption to the subatomic world of the Quantum Realm. From
there, the movie does a lot of teasing about some terrible threat, while also
showcasing a lot of sporadically colorful but mostly dingy landscapes and a
couple of quirky creatures via visual effects. Returning director Peyton Reed,
whose previous two entries of the isolated Ant-Man movies let the filmmaker have
some fun with the superhero clichés and formula, has been left with little
personality to put on display here, apart from some of the odder creatures and
letting Bill Murray essentially play himself in a superhero tale. It feels as if
we're being cheated of one of the few major characters in this franchise who
could get away with undermining the interconnected mess the whole thing is
becoming. Instead,
Ant-Manand occasionally the Waspis set against Kang the Conqueror
(Jonathan Majors), a being capable of traversing the multiverse and of seeing
the whole of time and space. Some will know this characteror at least one
iteration of himfrom the TV show ""Loki,"" and those who do in the
audience will also get a repeat of a big speech explaining his back story and
motives. Not everyone has the time for this expanding franchise, although it's
becoming more and more apparent that the producers want us to make it. If the
villain sounds over-the-top and destructive on some existential level, he is,
until he very much isn't at key points in the third act, but Majors' performance
is so grounded and subdued that Kang comes across as existentially melancholy
about being doomed to bring doom to countless dimensions and their inhabitants.
A striking makeup choice gives Kang a pair of scars that travel down from each
eye, as if a permanent stream of tears is on his face or that millennia's worth
of now-dried-up tears have eroded his flesh. The
general oddity and winking humor that have come to define Ant-Man, who's aware
of his lower rank on the superhero hierarchy of popularity, have mostly
dissipated in this installment (A big-headed secondary villain is too strange
and too cheaply designed to be as funny as his screen time would seem to
reflect). Without those qualities, Ant-Man
and the Wasp: Quantumania becomes just another stepping stone in some bigger
plot picture that may finally be coming togetherno matter how much
personality needs to be sacrificed to get there, apparently."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don&#8217;t care much for this movie&#46; I had more fun helping others figure out the Kang conundrum than what actually happened on screen&#46;
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE," Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man hasn’t been the biggest box office draw in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Nor are his adventures the most pivotal to the narrative or most impressive. But that’s the character’s appeal. Ant-Man’s powers are underwhelming; he can shrink and… talk to ants. The movies lean into those unimpressive abilities. Scott Lang, divorced ex-con and smalltime thief, doesn’t muscle up and defeat his enemies with a blast of cosmic boom. Instead, his story is about getting so-so powers and making do. The visual effects are a cornucopia of goofy size-gags—giant Thomas the Tank Engines sliding across the lawn, buildings shrunk to briefcase size, Scott stuck at middle-school height. The best battle sequence in the films is a fight between The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lily) and an antagonist named Ava Starr (Hannah John-Kamen) who can turn incorporeal. In the fight, Hope shrinks out of the way so Ava can’t hit her; Ava turns intangible so Hope’s blows go right through. Rather than a big display of might and force and property destruction, their exciting set piece is a small ballet of slapstick failure and incapacity—a portrait of super disempowerment. The new Ant-Man film, Quantomania, feels at first like a departure. Scott, Hope and their family travel to the quantum realm where Hope’s mother Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) was trapped for decades. They encounter a lot of CGI creatures visually cribbed from Star Wars and fight against a Darth Vader-like despot, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). It’s a sweeping adventure, far different than the small-scale family affairs about rescuing mom and avoiding parole violations that were the basis for the previous two Ant-Man films. I think that the turn to fantasy epic was a mistake; Quantomania is a step backwards from 2018’s just-about-perfect Ant Man and the Wasp. But Scott still shrinks and enlarges, talks to ants, and manages to maintain a smaller-than-life tone. Even in an alien galaxy, Scott, his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Hope, and her dad Hank (Michael Douglas) bicker and care for each other as they always have. Scott’s a lot more wowed by the fact that Hank read his book than the sentient buildings or threat to the time stream. When Janet admits that she had relationships with other guys during her 30 years away from home, it’s not a melodramatic reveal. Hank shrugs, and on they go; their marriage survived decades apart and can survive a little infidelity. Love makes the big things small and the small things big. Which is why one of the best scenes here is Scott and Cassie grown to titanic size crushing the bad guys, embracing and then talking about how they want some citrus. The multi-generational family dynamics keep Quantomania focused and small. It has the whimsy of Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, Narnia, or The Hobbit, rather than the must-stuff-everything-in sprawl of Wakanda Forever, Endgame, or The Eternals. The story beats are predictable and not that compelling—do we really need yet another Triumph of the Will visual reference? But who cares when the film’s real fun is in the weird goopy character lamenting that his body lacks orifices, the surprising return of the lost ants, or the spaceship you drive by putting your hands into slime. In one sequence, Scott’s bopping along a city street thinking about how weird his life is, but good. And suddenly he has a premonition of doom; is the world going to end? Will Kang destroy us all? And then the music picks up and he starts strolling again, signing autographs, taking pictures with dogs, looking forward to hanging out with his daughter. Some MCU films are filled with doom and gloom and claim to be about the fate of the universe and big issues. Ant-Man, though, knows superheroes are a little ridiculous, and that even when your rescuing an entire tiny realm, it’s best to keep a sense of proportion."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE," NEW YORK — There’s a lot thrown up on the screen in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” and much of it is perplexing. But one thing makes this picture stand out, at least for me: It’s the only superhero movie I can think of that hinges on two likable Jewish men being good dads. In the “Ant-Man” movies, the heroes are small and so are the stakes. These are the least essential movies in the enormous Marvel Cinematic Universe, the culture-gobbling juggernaut that began in 2008 and shows few signs of going away. A recurring gag here is that Paul Rudd — Ant-Man! — frequently has to remind people that he was instrumental in saving the world, but as part of the ensemble in the team-up “Avengers” films. He also still gets confused for Spider-Man, which is totally understandable. In the first two stand-along entries (2015’s “Ant-Man” and 2018’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp”) director Peyton Reed leaned into the visual absurdity of a microscopic superhero, crafting action sequences on toy train sets and skyscrapers wheeled around like luggage. Unfortunately, that playful big-then-small-then-big point-of-view dynamism is mostly lost in his newest chapter, and traded for unimpressive computer-generated sludge. The creatures and costumes our gang find in “the quantum realm” (which we’ll get to in a minute) look terrific, in an original “Star Wars” or “Tron” kind of way, and the story hints at going in a B-movie (or, in the case of all these insects, “bee movie”) direction like “Journey to the Center of the Earth.” But the second half of “Quantumania” makes the disappointing decision to play all this with absolute seriousness. The movie winds up being confusing (a sin) and dull (a bigger sin.) I’m absolutely flummoxed. But let’s focus on the positive. Paul Rudd, Hollywood’s most adorable Midwestern Jew, is back as Scott Lang, a reformed cat burglar who, thanks to innovative technology and a desire to help people, frequently saves the day as Ant-Man. He can shrink (down to the size of an ant!) which has proven time and again to be more useful than you might think. By his side is Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), his best gal, who does the same as The Wasp. (Only she can fly, too, whereas Ant-Man must ride an ant!) These miracles of science were created by Hope’s father, Dr. Hank Pym, played by Jewish-American (and Israel-supporter) Michael Douglas. Douglas’s character has gotten goofier as the movies have progressed, using his physics-defying science to enlarge pizza pies to save a few shekels, and delivering lines like “I like ants!” as if he were hanging out with George Costanza and Kramer. By Hank’s side is his wife, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who, if I may be so bold, still looks absolutely pfoxy as she advances well past AARP-qualifying age. She wins a lot of points for having to say some of the goofiest technobabble stuff, and manages to do it with a straight face. Lastly, is Kathryn Newton, as Scott’s daughter Cassie. These five (all scientists and adventurers) get sucked into the quantum realm. The idea, I think, is that they are within an atom, but once they are there, we see it’s also the same place where Janet was trapped for years. You would think the idea is that if you can somehow get so incredibly small to travel within an atom, and the fact that there are a near-infinity of atoms around us at all times, it wouldn’t be the same little spot. But I guess there are things we don’t know about higher dimensional realms (I have tried, oh, I have tried to understand Jewish-American physicist Brian Greene book’s “The Elegant Universe” and failed), so the movie gives us the weird (and poorly lit) Rhode Island with its own set of creatures and villains. Essentially our team goes to Oz and meets the locals, most of whom are wildly creative funny-looking creatures. “Hey, that guy looks like broccoli!” Michael Douglas shouts, in ultimate dad mode. And he’s right. There’s a guy who looks like broccoli, and later they all fly around in a spaceship that looks like a paramecium, sticking their hands in ooze to fly the thing. It’s terrific and the kids oughta love it. Exploring the new world in all its Saturday Morning Cartoon splendor is truly enjoyable, especially with wisecracking Paul Rudd at the center of it all. His primary motivation is simple: he wants to protect his daughter. She is, of course, old enough now to form her own identity, and has her own Pym-tech-enhanced suit. The two growing to see eye-to-eye forms what flimsy emotional story exists; it’s corny and predictable, but Rudd is such a winning performer it’s hard to condemn it too much. What you can (and should!) condemn is Marvel’s continued practice of slamming the breaks on the movie you are currently watching to shill for the next one. The zippy “how will our heroes get home?” story takes a sluggish detour while a new villain, Kang (Jonathan Majors), stomps around looking glum. Imagine Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren from the recent “Star Wars” movies, then strip him of any personality or motivation — that’s Kang. It’s a shame, as I’ve seen Majors in other films (like the forthcoming “Magazine Dreams”) and he is a very talented fellow. But he’s given nothing to do here, except put us all to sleep with his rote, confusing dialogue. I really don’t know what he wants to do, other than kill. And I don’t know why. I also don’t care. The movie isn’t good enough for me to care. But the movie is good enough for me to enjoy the cool creature effects and the charms of its main cast. I don’t think you should spend your hard-earned cash and see this in theaters, but streaming it in three months or so isn’t a bad bet. It may even make the penny-counting Hank Pym proud.

"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,The only part of Quantumania that is memorable is Majors who&#44; without spoiling&#44; will likely have more of a role in future films to come&#46; One just hopes they&apos;re better than this one&#46;
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Enthusiastic but unnecessary &#10;&#40;with standout performances by Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer&#41;&#46;
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE," Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne, along with Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne, explore the Quantum Realm, where they interact with strange creatures and embark on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they thought was possible. After two films in the franchise from director Peyton Reed, he stated that he no longer wants the character of Ant-Man to be the palate cleanser following up The Avengers films. Even though both his previous films were well-received critically and financially worldwide, it’s difficult to blame the man. He did the hard work and now wants more. What’s great about the Ant-Man films is that they make you comfortable. They’re a huge sigh of relief with comedy infused in for a near guaranteed good time. However, Reed has big shoes to fill if he claims this third installment is on Avenger-level status. Quantumania is an entertaining film, but it may be clear that the director’s aspirations of quality ended up somewhere lost in the multiverse. President Kevin Feige has also expressed in the past that he designed the MCU (The Marvel Cinematic Universe) in a way that the average non-comic book loving moviegoer will be able to comprehend the story without having seen every previous movie in the entire arc. While I do praise Quantumania for delivering something different and unique to the MCU, it’s questionable whether regular viewers will enjoy themselves. There may be clouds of confusion that fill their heads instead of enjoyment. That could be an invalid assessment, but it’s said with confidence. However, as a comic book nerd like myself, there was still plenty to leave a smile on my face. The Ant-Man series is nothing short of funny. It always is, and that’s one of the best things about it. Sometimes we do need that light-heartedness without being too over the topic with random stupidity and that’s the lane that Ant-Man has carved out well in the MCU. While the entire supporting cast isn’t back this time around, due to ninety-five percent of the movie taking place in the Quantum realm, the film is still able to deliver the comedy that makes the overall franchise great. Especially during the first two acts of this film. While it wasn’t as strong as the previous two films, I still found myself caring about the main cast, the Ant-Man family. Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) takes on a more central role, and while I didn’t care for her disrespectful tone towards her father Scott (Paul Rudd), I still found it to be somewhat realistic. Just for a better dynamic between the two, I wish Paul’s character would’ve checked Cassie a bit more than he did in the film as a stricter parent. However, it was a great representation that being a parent isn’t easy. Hope (Evangeline Lilly) did take somewhat of a back seat this time around, which didn’t necessarily ruin the viewing experience, but it was noticeable and may turn others off if they loved her character. The chemistry was still great between Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer). It was actually somewhat hilarious. If anything, there should’ve been more of it between the two. When it comes to Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror he’s the best in the film by far! This man is a true menace and his bite is as big as his bark. Everything about his character was top-tier. The design of the costume, the makeup on Majors’ face, and the utility of Kang The Conqueror’s powers and/or abilities were a dream come true on the big screen. Speaking of the big screen please see this movie on the biggest screen possible, due to the majority of the quantum realm shots being filmed with IMAX lenses. Kang is truly a top-notch villain in the MCU and is easily in the top 5 and maybe in the top 3. He’s just that great, and everything this character has to deliver in the future looks promising. During the action, he didn’t hesitate to let his enemies know just how dangerous he is and deliver pain and torture if necessary. To be afraid of him is an understatement. However, that is short-lived in a sense. While his character is fantastic it was frustrating to see him stand around toward the end of the film when his base is being attacked. Other than that, the man is flawless. With the majority of this film taking place in the quantum realm, it’s very effects-heavy. There have been times when Marvel has missed the mark in the past trying to sell realistic imagery, but they don’t have that problem here. If anything, the studio did a fine job with the visuals which is fantastic with all the negative commentary that’s been floating around the internet about the day-to-day behind the scenes. There are a few surprises that come into play as well, and they do their job of shocking the audience which is always great. It is also safe to say that the first two acts in the film are very strong, but the film starts to have problems during the third act. Cassie Lang appears to have some type of plot armor where she’s invincible. No matter what situation she’s in she has a very easy time escaping with little effort. This is extremely frustrating seeing that she doesn’t have much field experience, but time and time again she is able to squeeze out of nearly every situation with barely a scratch. It’s also disappointing that what makes Ant-Man so great is what hurt the film in the third act as well. That’s having to do with the unnecessary comedy during moments of battle and/or tension. I want to feel like things are taken seriously and that the characters we’re rooting for are in actual danger. When you throw jokes into the mix it takes the stakes away. Darren M.O.D.O.K (Corey Stoll) is a returning character in the franchise, and while his reintroduction into this film was funny, the character failed miserably in the third act being turned into a dumb dick joke. Why is this taking place in the middle of battle? Some of the Top MCU films don’t possess this random goofiness during their run. Save all the funny silly haha moments for the beginning or middle of the film, but not in the middle of a war. His acronym implies that he kills the victims but none of that was present in this film, unfortunately. Again, a great intro for the character, but a failed conclusion in the third act. In addition to that, everything about Kang was great except his army. It was hyped up so much that he has built an unstoppable empire, but that wasn’t clear enough during the film. The character is what sells with or without his armor, but not his armada. Quantumania is many things, and this film will for sure have mixed reactions. The runtime only comes in at two hours and five minutes, and I wish it was longer to flesh out a lot of its themes. The quantum realm is a lot to take in. That being said, it’s still a fun enjoyable film. Whether or not you like it can demonstrate where your expectations were before you began to watch. That’s with every film or tv show, but this time the director set a high bar that I don’t feel he was able to reach. Out of all of the Ant-Man films this one is my least favorite, but that’s mainly because the first two films were done so well. They’re both at least in the top 15 of the MCU, so beating that can be very difficult. Marvel sometimes goes over the top with their jokes during serious moments in their films, and that’s the anchor that holds this film down from being even better than what it is. That’s an easy fix for the future, but Marvel needs to realize how mature their audience is, and they don’t always need to err on the side of caution, because it can be detrimental. "
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," In 2015, criminal-turned-superhero Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) introduced fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to the Quantum Realm, a unique yet feared dimension in the Multiverse. But in his first outing as Ant-Man, he not only transported to the realm and escape it but proved to scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) that the realm is accessible – establishing a new world for them to explore, not to mention the battleground for Ant-Man’s latest adventure. Marking the 31st film of the MCU, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania sees Lang and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), as well as Pym, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), and their daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) transported into the Quantum Realm, where they face off against Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). Although Ant-Man has been at the forefront of some of the MCU’s more light-hearted films, it means that it doesn’t dare to delve into hard-hitting, emotionally fraught narratives. In other words, it feels like Scott Lang/Ant-Man hasn’t fallen into the deep, dark end of being a superhero. His latest instalment kickstarts Phase 5 of the MCU, so there is no better chance for Marvel to establish him as a protagonist who has suffered as much emotional conflict as Iron Man or Captain America. But despite Peyton Reed back as director and MCU veterans – Rudd, Douglas, and Lilly, reprising their respective roles, Ant-Man continues to heavily rely on comedy over drama. With supporting characters such as Scott’s now-teenage daughter Cassie (Newton) and Janet van Dyne (Pfieffer), as well as new nemesis Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), having significant roles, screenwriter Jeff Loveness has to not only shape a narrative that reaffirms the family dynamic between the Langs and van Dynes but establish the Quantum Realm, a place that has only been teased in previous Ant-Man instalments. There is a level of ambition driving Quantumania amid the vast visual effects while the MCU settles into its latest phase. But Reed and Loveness have a lot on their plate and ultimately try to do too much, so the film subsequently caves under the weight of its numerous elements. Scott is milking his role as an Avenger to the point that he overcompensates for being a dad to Cassie, who is evidently following in his footsteps in becoming a superhero. Meanwhile, Hope (Lilly) and Hank (Douglas) are getting used to the return of Janet, whose traumatic experiences in the Quantum Realm stop her from sharing her memories with her family. All of these small elements exacerbate when they are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, which exposes them to a new world and Kang, an exiled ‘traveller’ and a former acquaintance of Janet. When her secrets are unveiled, all hell breaks loose as the plot struggles to find momentum as it strays into all-too-familiar but underdeveloped emotional conflicts among characters, plot holes and almost redundant characters such as freedom fighter Jentorra (Katy O’Brian) and telepath Quaz (William Jackson Harper). In addition, the overly cryptic dialogue and numerous monologues make it hard to gauge the significance of the Quantum Realm and what it means for the MCU. After Marvel shows such as Loki and Wandavision, not to mention last year’s Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, have shown that there are limitless possibilities to the MCU so it is a shame that Quantumania relies on convention. However, the casting prevents this instalment from being a misfire. Rudd and Newton have a great on-screen chemistry as father and daughter while Pfeiffer has a more prominent role than her brief appearance in Ant-Man and the Wasp. While Bill Murray and Michael Douglas offer occasional bouts of comedy, the film belongs to Majors, who makes an impact as the quietly menacing yet physically imposing Kang. There are certain moments in the film that tease audiences about future instalments but as we are now in the depths of the Multiverse saga, everything within the MCU should be starting to come together rather than stay apart. After the mixed reviews of the last few Marvel films, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania looks set to continue the trend with the cast, especially Majors, stopping this from being a complete bore."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE," Just as the trouble with Bible-thumping is the thumping, not the Bible, the problem with superhero-franchise movies isn’t the source material but the uses to which it’s put. If some viewers and even some critics have given vent to feelings of superhero fatigue, it’s not only because of the sheer number of such movies. If they were more consistently good, they’d be more consistently welcomed. What’s fatiguing, in particular, is the formula—one of overproduced, corporate-dictated, eye-on-the-marketplace, focus-grouped, committee-created cinema. When the Marvel world was still being developed, many of the movies had the appealing overflow of loose ends, a delight in discovery unconstrained by formatting, because the program was yet to be figured out. Now the machine is humming, and it has been a while—specifically, since “Black Panther,” in 2018—since a Marvel movie has felt as if it wasn’t completely a package within a package, an unmitigated prefabrication. Another earlier Marvel movie, the first “Ant-Man” film, from 2015, was a giddy delight. I don’t have factual knowledge of the creative leeway that the studio offered its director, Peyton Reed, but that filmmaker’s loopy humor and exquisite style were on display there. The second film in the cycle, “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” felt tethered—Reed unleashed intermittent flourishes of inspiration, but now they were completely bound by the M.C.U.’s gravitational field, pulled down to the franchise’s established map, and sent forth to do their duty. The third film in the series, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” which comes out Friday, reaches an appalling form of perfection. The story is a family affair, bringing together three generations. There’s Scott Lang, a.k.a. Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and his partner, Hope van Dyne, known as the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly). There’s Hope’s father, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), who devised the technology with which they shrink down to bug size yet exert colossal force; and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), Hank’s wife and Hope’s mother (and the original Wasp), who was trapped for thirty years in the infinitesimal, subatomic Quantum Realm. Finally, there’s Scott’s teen-age daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), a social activist and (following in Hank’s footsteps) a science prodigy, who invents a device to communicate with the Quantum Realm. But it turns out to have (pardon the pun) a bug, which causes all five family members to be zapped down into it, with no obvious means of returning. That’s where the story—and the artistic trouble—begin. In the first two “Ant-Man” movies, the Quantum Realm, where characters shrink to subatomic size, is depicted as hallucinatory, lurid abstractions. (Or, as Scott says in the second film, it’s “really trippy.”) They get in, whizz through the colored lights and seemingly immaterial forms, and (fortunately) get out—one of the key maneuvers of the second film is Hank’s rescue of Janet from her thirty-year confinement. In “Quantumania,” the familial quintet is zapped back into the infinitesimal domain in which Janet somehow survived for three decades, but, instead of an amorphous mind bend of the vertiginous void, it’s now a world of its own, and it’s populated. (As one of the newly arrived fivesome exclaims, “There’s quantum people in the Quantum Realm.”) It’s not just humans but also a humanoid who can read minds (William Jackson Harper), plus vaguely human-shaped beings with glowing blue heads, others with green floret-topped heads that Hank likens to broccoli, lizardy hybrids, jellyfish-like floaters, gigantic flying stingrays, and buildings that are alive. There’s a variety of neighborhoods, cities, and regions, spread out over wide expanses and featuring a variety of landscapes, ranging from the gloomily barren to the hypertechnologically superurban. The Quantum Realm turns out to be nothing more than inner space, the very small counterpart of a galaxy far, far away. Its modelling on the “Star Wars” template is made all too explicit by a scene (the liveliest in the film) that’s a parody of the celebrated cantina set piece. As in “Star Wars,” it’s the politics that drives the action: the Ant/Wasp five are menaced by a quantumaniacal tyrant called Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who needs their technology to carry out his deranged scheme of destruction. (The MacGuffin is a “multiversal engine core” that Kang needs.) They also encounter the principled underground leader Jentorra (Katy M. O’Brian), who’s plotting a rebellion against Kang, and they become unwilling participants in the titanic clash that results. The best thing about “Quantumania” is, surprisingly, its script (by Jeff Loveness), which is like saying that the best thing about a building is its blueprint. The story is unusually compact and logical, but it takes place in a factitious world so slight that it might as well be rendered on tracing paper. Though the Quantum Realm is a world of its own, the world-building is painfully flimsy, devoid of the history, the social organization, the environmental concepts, or the ins and outs of its material setup. It isn’t so much created as tossed off—the stentorian tirades and seething threats of its confrontations, the leaps and smashes and zaps of its fights, the blasts and roars and gyrations of its battles have all the weight and immediacy of index cards stuck onto A.I.-synthesized futuristic tropes. It isn’t only the ways of life in the Quantum Realm that remain undeveloped; its physical setting is generic. Reed, the director, never gets to deploy his original and distinctive art of style. The hordes of visual-effects artists whose names roll by in the infinity credits are the veritable auteurs of the film, with no overarching sensibility to guide them. The movie is so dominated by its graphics that it plays like animation, but in reverse. Those techniques, instead of endowing the inanimate with life, subtract it from the film’s vital presences: its cast. The scant grounding and bare inner life of the characters give the remarkable actors little to work with. It’s a delight to hear the purpose and the spin that Pfeiffer and Douglas (and, in a cameo, Bill Murray) put on plain lines of dialogue; Majors brings Shakespearean thunder, and O’Brian’s blunt assertiveness offers a striking contrast. But even the grandest and most passionate moments are dramatically shrunk to what feel like clips of clips. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Despite its flaws&#44; Quantumania brings that traditional Marvel comic book flavor&#44; along with deeper sci-fi weirdness&#44; and is an overall satisfying experience&#46;
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," The feature-length films of Phase 4 MCU, which kicks off with ‘Black Widow’ before culminating in ‘Black Panther: Wakanda Forever’, were pretty much a bumpy ride. I personally enjoyed ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ and ‘Black Panther: Wakanda Forever’ and, to a certain extent, ‘Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.’ But I found others like ‘Eternals’ mostly a mixed bag. And now, we are heading to Phase 5, which continues the Multiverse Saga, focusing on the return of Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), where we last saw him – not counting one of the episodes in the animated anthology series ‘What If…?’ — in ‘Avengers: Endgame’ four years ago. Here’s a quick recap: He became one of the pivotal characters who devised the plan of traveling back in time using the Quantum Realm to retrieve all the Infinity Stones before the Snap takes place with the help of the surviving Avengers team. In ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,’ which marks his third solo film, Lang and Hope Van Dyne/Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) along with Hope’s parents, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Lang’s 18-year-old daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton) as they accidentally end up in the Quantum Realm following an incident gone wrong. From there, they encounter Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors, playing a different role from the He Who Remains’ alternate-timeline variant character seen in the Disney+ series, ‘Loki’), who happens to be trapped in the Quantum Realm as well. For years since Scott Lang/Ant-Man was first introduced in 2015, Paul Rudd has carried his now-iconic role well enough, but his first two solo films were largely erratic. The first film was decent, thanks to Edgar Wright’s additional input in the screenwriting department. But the 2018 sequel – ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp’ – was a step-down effort that, despite the return of Peyton Reed, the story was marred by hit-and-miss comedy moments and an underwhelming introduction of the enigmatic Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen). Not to mention the sequel feels more like an extended filler episode, as if it was served as both appetizer and dessert between the huge entrée of ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ and ‘Avengers: Endgame.’ This, in turn, actually worries me a lot because history might repeat itself in ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.’ But it looks like there’s a glimmer of hope after Jeff Loveness is given the solo writing credit for the third movie instead of enlisting the same screenwriters from the 2018 sequel. If his name doesn’t sound familiar, it’s worth noting that he’s responsible for writing several episodes for the animated series ‘Rick and Morty.’ The good news is, Loveness’ script does evoke a certain out-there and surrealistic ‘Rick and Morty’ vibe from the kooky introduction of several alien lifeforms (among them includes an odd-looking creature with a head literally looks like broccoli, a jar-shaped slimy blob named Veb (David Dastmalchian) and the scene-stealing giant floating head nicknamed M.O.D.O.K. — short for Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing) to the Schrödinger-style ‘probability storm’ sequence. The latter sure feels like I’m watching a snippet of a “Rick and Morty” episode. Peyton Reed, who directed the first two movies, is again calling the shots for ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.’ He does an adequate job mixing the wacky silliness of Loveness’ script with a surprisingly hefty amount of a dark and serious tone this time around. This is particularly evident with the supervillain appearance of Kang the Conqueror. His character is given substantial screen time here.  While I’m getting a certain Denzel Washington-style of contemplative and intense acting prowess within Jonathan Majors’ performance, it still made me feel like Reed is missing the opportunity here. An opportunity that could have made Majors’ Kang a stronger and more imposing figure. We learn about what Kang can do, but how Reed portrays his character is well, disappointingly restrained. For an antagonist who shaped up to become the next Big Bad after the fearsome Thanos (Josh Brolin) in the first three phases of MCU movies, he certainly deserves better than just slapping him with a perfunctory backstory and character motivation. Reed also could have embraced Loveness’ trippy narrative structure, but there’s a nagging feeling like he’s holding back when he should be let loose. Besides, this is supposed to be the MCU’s continuation of the Multiverse Saga. The word ‘multiverse’ itself means it should have been a movie that explored infinite possibilities and a whole lot of imagination. It’s not like Reed doesn’t give us imaginative set-pieces (the aforementioned ‘probability storm’ sequence comes to mind), but these scenes only occur a few and far between. The heavy use of CGI is good but not great. At least it doesn’t end up looking like I have to tolerate the inferior and atrocious digital fakery seen in the likes of ‘Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over’. The action, in the meantime, lacks palpable tension and thrills. They tend to look visually incomprehensible with the over-reliance on blur effects and quick pans, as if the movie wants to cover up some of its rough-around-the-edges CGI effects. As for the cast, Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang/Ant-Man character is charming and likable as always, while he gets to stretch some dramatic acting muscles in some of the emotional moments in the movie. Casting Kathryn Newton proves to be the studio’s right choice, as evidently seen in her spot-on plucky performance as Cassie. Michael Douglas delivers a solid supporting turn as Hank Pym, and then, there’s Michelle Pfeiffer’s performance, who brings enough gravitas to her role as Janet. Still, it’s kind of a pity that Evangeline Lilly is somehow underutilized as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp.

"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ant-Man and The Wasp&#58; Quantumania feels like it&apos;s trying to be a Marvel movie&#46; The jokes are played up too much&#46; Not everything needs to be funny&#46;
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL," Honestamente empiezo a temer que el género de superhéroes está perdiendo precipitadamente la habilidad de balance; o demasiado serias (The Batman, Eternals) o demasiado bobas (Thor: Love and Thunder, Black Adam). Entre las dos malas opciones prefiero lo segundo, porque al menos me rio por par de horas, mucho mejor que estar mirando el reloj preguntándome cuanto le faltará. Así me sentí con Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, la tercera de Ant-Man y la trigésimo primera de Marvel Studios. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania intenta ser muchas cosas; una película sobre familia, un explosivo comienzo a la Fase 5 y la llegada de su gran villano. Poco logra de todo eso, porque su tono varia demasiado entre denso, complicado y desordenado, con los mejores momentos ocurriendo gracias a su estelar elenco. Primero lo positivo. Paul Rudd es la manifestación física del carisma, teniendo química hasta con una silla coja, sus interacciones con cualquier otra figura del filme siempre son agradables, manteniendo Quantumania en un nivel pasable. Aunque la “MVP” es Michelle Pfeiffer como Jane Van Dyne – la Avispa Original- dándole gravedad a la trama. Su interpretación es tan prístina como se puede esperar de una de las mejores actrices de su generación, consiguiendo que el peligro se sienta real. Si tan solo el guion de Jeff Loveness hubiera hecho tan buen trabajo. Luego de varias películas usando el Reino Cuántico de muletilla para resolver problemas (salvar a Scott, viajar en el tiempo, etc), finalmente visitamos ese “universo existiendo fuera del tiempo y espacio” cuando     Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), la hija de Scott Lang (Rudd), construye una especie de radar con la ayuda de Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), para encontrar otros que se pudieran perder allí como le pasó a Scott. La máquina accidentalmente lanza la familia entera hacia el mundo microscópico, separándola en el camino, por lo que ahora Janet, Hank y Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lily) tendrán que reencontrarse con Scott y Cassie. El problema es que Janet, durante los 30 años que vivió en el Reino Cuántico, fue más o menos responsable de la llegada y conquista de Kang (Jonathan Majors), un viajero temporal queriendo dominar todos los universos, atrapado en el Reino Cuántico luego que Janet entendiera su error. Hay tanta explicación de tantas cosas, que casi me sentía que estaba tomando una clase de historia, pero peor porque esta es historia ficticia y ni siquiera lo suficientemente interesante. Jonathan Majors hace lo más que puede con lo que le dieron, y se nota cuanto trato de hacer ver a Kang como un tipo peligroso sin ser una imitación de Thanos, pero, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania no era el mejor ligar para tratar de hacer esto. Las primera dos películas de Ant-Man son divertidas. El concepto de un superhéroe que se hace pequeño y controla diferentes tipos de hormigas es perfecto para una comedia, buscando todas las maneras de jugar con la idea, pero el potencial de aprovechar eso en un mundo como el Reino Cuántico quedo completamente desperdiciado. Además, ¿sin Michael Peña? Uno de los mejores personajes del MCU, que hasta tiene sus propios memes, ¿a quién se le ocurrió esto? Y no se ni como explicarles lo que hicieron con MODOK, una parte de mí no quiere revelar nada, otra parte quiere evitarles la desilusión. Hay buenos momentos en Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, especialmente las interacciones entre los miembros de la familia, mayormente cuando son con Scott o Janet, ya que Hope apenas existe, y Cassie parece haber sido escrita por alguien que solo conoce gente joven en películas y televisión. El resto es una pesada ensalada de exposición, ruido y colores con apenas alguna línea coherente atándolo todo en un festival de CGI sin corazón ni emoción, que simplemente existe para adelantar los planes en camino, más evidente con dos escenas adicionales –una después de créditos principales, otra a final- que me dejaron todavía mas decepcionado de lo que ya estaba.

"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE," Ant-Man’s place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has always been the most comedic. The concept of a tiny superhero, running across kitchen countertops or riding ants as if they’re horses – it’s all antithetical to larger-than-life superheroics. Ant-Man’s antics have often seemed frivolous to many MCU fans and that may be why his movies have leaned hard into all sorts of scientific explanations to qualify his powers, the experiments he’s been a part of, and the adventures he spearheads. But despite the MCU’s attempts to add such intellectual heft to his existence, the Ant-Man movies are best enjoyed as cinematic fluff, ixnaying any real intellectual rigor. This is why his latest adventure entitled ANT-MAN & THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA, which opens in theaters everywhere tomorrow, is quite frustrating despite being packed with a lot of fun. So much of it is delightfully silly as the Quantum Realm is revealed to be like the STAR WARS cantina on steroids, but too much of it wants to be a serious examination of history, regrets, and the principles of physics. That’s a heavy lift, even for an ant. The movie does start off heading in the right direction with a light, breezy feel as Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is high on life after having helped the Avengers defeat Thanos a few years ago. His new family of Hope/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), her father Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Hank’s fellow scientist wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) is one big happy group of over-achievers. Lang’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), now a teenager, is even following in the Pym family’s footsteps by showing talent as a science whiz. She’s just found a way to explore the Quantum Realm without endangering any of her family and papa Scott couldn’t be prouder. Of course, the device she’s invented ends up sucking all five of the clan into the Realm, and soon they’re not only battling to find a way back home but having to navigate all the dangers of the ‘alien universe’ they’ve catapulted into once again. Not only is the terrain dangerous, full of all kinds of odd foliage and landscapes that would make James Cameron jealous, but it’s filled with ridiculously odd inhabitants too. Some of the alien creatures are silly, some are menacing, and one, the new supervillain Kang (Jonathan Majors), is a dangerous dictator. In the role of Lang/Ant-Man, Rudd gets to play both doofus and straight man. His physical ineptitude as the egotistical hero is hilarious, as are his deadpan reactions to all the zaniness unspooling around him. When QUANTUMANIA makes the most of his mania, the film’s a rollicking good time. But too much of the time the Quantum part dominates, making too much hay of all the explanations of the multiverse. Does any audience member really care to hear the characters dwell on discussions of various dimensions, timelines, and alternate histories when there are broccoli-headed aliens to laugh at? And yet, every couple of minutes the action stops for someone to explain to another just what is going on in this truly out-there dimension. Even the introduction of Kang isn’t wholly successful despite the formidable Majors. He’s both charming and menacing, like a good Bond villain, but the poor guy has to keep explaining what he’s done, doing or plans to do. He starts to sound like Dr. Evil over-explaining his schemes to Austin Powers. But that film was a parody. QUANTUMANIA is trying to be serious a great deal of the time and all that exposition is a drag. Still, when QUANTUMANIA is crackling, it’s an oddball delight full of well-timed physical schtick, crazy world-building, and a game cast including Corey Stall playing a sort of Humpty Dumpty version of his villain from the first film. (You have to see it, to believe it.) Pfeiffer is given a lot to do here and Douglas is clearly enjoying his comedic role, particularly when he gets to put his hands in a gelatin slinky needed to drive a spaceship. Newton can play sass in her sleep, and she’s a good addition to the fam. Only Lilly is shortchanged as her Hope is given precious little to do. She is quite the fighter in the epic finale, but the whole battle is pitched way too large for two superheroes named after tiny bugs. The MCU clearly is in love with the whole multiverse/timeline trope as it has now driven END GAME, SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE, two DOCTOR STRANGE films, the LOKI series, the MOON KNIGHT series, and the ANT-MAN big screen adventures. But by now, it’s simply too much of everything, everywhere, all at once. And if all these dimensions can be so easily altered and repaired, then where are the stakes? Nothing matters if life and death can be so easily reset. Frankly, it would behoove Kevin Feige and the filmmakers of the MCU to take a page from the Ant-Man gestalt and scale things smaller during phase five. What made the first two ANT-MAN films so pleasurable was that they were modest. They were more character studies than an all-hands-on-deck epic. Not every MCU film needs to save entire galaxies. Sometimes, it’s enough to engage with an alien whose head looks like broccoli."
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,I will never unsee MODOK&#46;
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Jonathan Majors as Kang was great -- [he] made the film entirely. I just wish the film he was in as a whole was better.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE," The Marvel Cinematic Universe took a small step into Phase Five of its storied grand franchise comprised of smaller franchises with “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” The third in the “Ant-Man” series reintroduces Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), the villain who will rule across the assorted films that will make up the films and, presumably, Disney+ TV series such as “Loki,” where he first appeared. No ordinary being, Kang can bend time and space and is seemingly hellbent on dominating the universe. The guy has got goals – serious goals – and he would have been forced to keep them to himself in the Quantum realm were it not for Scott Lang/Ant-Man's (Paul Rudd) curious, inventive daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). Lang, his fiancée’s family, Hope/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), find themselves sucked into that alternate universe after Cassie’s experiment goes a wee bit awry. Of course, Janet spent three decades there and is very familiar with its dangers – many of which she didn’t share with her family. Although separated upon entry to that universe, everyone is shocked to learn that another civilization exists in the realm, and Janet? She’s a popular lady. During her time there, she met Kang and befriended him. He arrived to the world with a damaged craft, and she helped him repair it. However, upon learning what he represents (Quick, who can remember the ending of “Loki” from last year? I thought not.) – let’s just say it’s not pleasant. She cannot allow his type of malevolence to go unchallenged and damages his vehicle, stranding him in the Quantum realm. What she doesn’t think through: the damage he will cause there. After she returns with her family she finds a universe under siege and Kang, a nearly god-like individual holding grudges. He’s perfectly willing to get them all back home, but not before he takes Cassie hostage, and Scott must do whatever Kang wants to get her freed. Yes, significant amounts of action ensue. By now, Rudd knows how to have fun with the character and the premise of Ant-Man. With Douglas and Pfeiffer in substantially more significant roles, the film adds more gravitas, and Newton has little problem fitting right in. However, for those looking for a standout performance, just revel in the subtle, sinister turn that Majors pulls off. He showed plenty of chops when the character debuted in “Loki.” But that was “fun” Kang. He shows a completely different side in this film, and all signs point to him being able to do it again and again and again across Phase Five. Director Peyton Reed, who helmed the first two films, returns with a steady hand, and by now he knows the actors and the tone necessary to create compelling entertainment. Although the sense of menace, because of the stakes, is kicked up a notch or three. What he deserves high praise for – assembling an art direction team that mines several influences, including the 1980 film “Flash Gordon,” for a unique look that complements the film well."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE," It's a real indictment of any movie as unrelentingly loud, bombastic and big when you turn to your plus one in the screening room and find them asleep. That was the case, for me, an hour into Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, my partner snoozing through a lofty monologue delivered by Jonathan Majors' new omni-villain Kang, harping on with exposition about his desire to take over the multiverse. Some time later, if even for a minute, I also nodded off. Paul Rudd returns as the wise-cracking Scott Lang (alias Ant-Man, as goes the title), finding himself in something of a restless bind after saving the world as one of the Avengers in Avengers: Endgame. He's re-branded himself as a memoirist, touring the libraries and cafés of San Francisco for readings of his new book, Look Out for the Little Guy (which you can buy in real-life, as is Marvel's endless commerce spin). In the meantime, daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who has seen no end of shit and is presumably in desperate need of a therapist, has been getting herself in heaps of trouble, protesting the crisis of homelessness in the wake of the snap. Turns out she's also a mega-genius, or something, who in the five years that everyone was snapped away managed to invent a “hubble space telescope” for the Quantum Realm, the mysterious sub-atomic world which, as it turns out, looks like a planet from a Star Wars flick. Things go south, and the device suddenly sucks Scott, Cassie, and their extended family — Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank (Michael Douglas, hilariously unphased) — down to inner space, where they discover an array of oh-so terrestrial biomes. And people. And aliens — well, not aliens, because they're from Earth, just infinitesimally tiny. So here we are, on another soundstage built of a maze of green screens and the occasional polystyrene rock — ahem, the Quantum Realm — running away from globulous not-aliens, primitive tribals and a fellow who looks like a stalk of broccoli. The object, then, is to get back to Big Earth: fortunately, Janet knows a guy from her own 30-year marooning down on the Quantum side, who they meet up with in a jovial (again, very Star Wars) cantina. A fight breaks out, lasers zip around, lights flash, the CGI budget inflates; there's an ongoing joke about holes, the euphemism in which you're not sure is deliberate; you know what to expect after 31 films and eight TV shows.  It's around an hour in that we're properly acquainted with Majors' Kang, by far the most compelling element at play: he emanates movie star gravitas, helped by the fact that he's the only guy who really seems committed to the bit. It's a shame he's given so much of that aforementioned, dawdling exposition to deal with. It's strange, too, that this big villain — the guy who is meant to be the new Thanos — is properly introduced, following an episode of Loki in which we saw one of his more benevolent variants, by way of the MCU's snooziest film. Thanos was a slow-burn threat, not properly revealed until Avengers: Infinity War, which greatly sold his terrifying omnipotence; this guy could be any other paint-by-the-numbers Marvel baddie, if not for Majors' elevating presence. To introduce Kang, really, is all Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania exists to do. In and of itself, it's a boring story devoid of meaningful stakes. The post-Endgame era of Marvel has been crying out for some kindling, something to throw the afterburners on; this is just more ugly cement."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE," There was a lot to unpack in Avengers: Endgame, but thinking about the character arc of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) made me quite sad in 2019. Poor bastard came out of prison and vowed never to abandon his daughter again, then he was trapped in the quantum realm for five years through no fault of his own, and his little girl grew into a teenager without him. After that, he went off to tell the Avengers about his plan to build a time machine. I would have handcuffed myself to my child until she became a thoroughly miserable adult. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the first movie spotlighting Scott since Endgame, and it pits him against a villain who commands time and is canny enough to dangle the prospect of giving Scott back those years that he missed raising his daughter. Furthermore, this bad guy is so powerful that Scott has little chance of outsmarting or outfighting him. I’m sad to report that this is where the cleverness stops. The film opens with Scott giving up that superhero life to write a celebrity memoir entitled Look Out for the Little Guy and be a father to his teenage daughter Cassie (a brunette Kathryn Newton). Cassie has become a science and engineering wiz in her dad’s absence, and she invents a device that will communicate with the quantum realm so that nobody ever becomes stranded again. This backfires, and the device transports her, Scott, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), and Hope’s parents (Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer) to said realm, which Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) rules with an iron fist. He has history with Janet van Dyne, who turns out to have withheld a hell of a lot from her family about her 30 or so years at subatomic level. Kang wants to return to normal size and makes the aforementioned offer to Scott in exchange for his help, and the movie’s most obvious blunder is that Scott never seriously considers it. At least when Kang makes the same offer to Janet 30 years prior so she can raise little Hope, she’s torn up about turning him down. Kang can’t be trusted, of course, but you’d think Scott’s disappearances from Cassie’s life would result in more than just a few bitter one-liners. The Dallas native Majors is an imposing physical presence, and you believe him when he tells Scott in mid-confrontation, “You’re out of your league,” but in the end, he’s another boring Marvel villain who’s not much other than his desire to destroy stuff. I’m concerned that the Marvel movies (with the notable exception of the Black Panther films) are starting to look the same. All those orange skies and billowing clouds of smoke and weapons glowing either red or blue — if you took a random frame from this and compared it to the same from the last Thor movie and the last Guardians of the Galaxy movie, you’d be hard-pressed to tell what came from where. The last Ant-Man movie had visuals like a Hello Kitty Pez dispenser blowing up to the size of a refrigerator during a car chase, but there’s no such whimsy here. The fantasy world that the characters move around in doesn’t have enough visual cues, so that it’s hard to even tell when Scott grows to 10 times his size. The only creative bit is when Scott enters a “probability storm” that spontaneously generates thousands of clones of him, leading to the danger that he’ll be crushed by the dead bodies of himself. This movie wants to give Scott more dramatic weight, but the thematic heaviness doesn’t suit the series or director Peyton Reed. The series was always better when it was funny, and despite Rudd’s best efforts, the comedy largely falls flat, and even Bill Murray’s presence as a boorish space lord who brags to Hank about his own wild sexual encounters with Janet can’t lift this. The subtitle of Quantumania promises wacky hijinks with the miniature world like we’ve seen with previous movies about multiverses. That doesn’t materialize."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE," Tras dos más que aceptables entregas iniciales, Ant-Man: El Hombre Hormiga (2015) y Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), llega a los cines de todo el mundo una tercera película con el mismo director de las dos anteriores (Peyton Reed) y elenco principal, pero que pierde buena parte de su gracia, lógica y capacidad de sorpresa.

"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE," Disney is asking critics to avoid spoilers in their reviews of this third installment in the MCU Ant-Man series.  To which one might ask: What’s there to spoil?  “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” has a story so threadbare that it might have been written on a napkin, gussied up with a cascade of CGI effects that are splashy but rather ugly and exhausting to endure.  The movie reeks of desperation. Cassie, one of those insufferable teen geniuses who are fixtures in the MCU (presumably to appeal to the target audience), has invented am amazing super-microscope than can peer into the Quantum Realm.  Unfortunately it sucks all of them into that realm, where they encounter a multiplicity of weird-looking creatures; it’s as though the “Star Wars” Cantina scene had multiplied a thousandfold. But there are some humanoid-looking folks as well.  One is Kang (Jonathan Majors), a stranded time-traveler whom Janet knew from her long previous stay; he’s now a cruel tyrant looking to escape the Quantum Realm so he can hop from one part of the multiverse to another to do mischief.  A second is a sleazy associate of Kang’s named Krylar (Bill Murray, bringing his patented bemusement to his cameo, and little else).  And still others are freedom-fighters, like telepath Quaz (William Jackson Harper) and his warrior friend Jentorra (Katy O’Brian). The whole plot of “Quantumania” involves the heroes’ efforts to find one another—they were separated when thrust into the microworld—and to defeat Kang and his minions, the most notable of whom is Scott’s old frenemy Darren (Corey Stoll), who’s been transformed into MODOK, a murderous mechanical thingy with a huge human head and tiny metal arms and legs.  Both story threads are subject to tiresome repetition—there’s loads of running around in front of elaborately cartoonish backgrounds, and Scott spends most of his time demanding to find out where Cassie is, while Kang issues stern commands about killing people and such.  Neither Rudd nor Majors comes off well amidst the hubbub.  Rudd is an ingratiating fellow, but apart from the bookending segments in the “normal” world, where he interacts with adoring dopes like an elderly coffee shop owner (Ruben Rabasa) and the boobish Baskin Robbins manager (Gregg Turkington) who once fired him, he’s not given much opportunity to use his comic chops to much effect.  Majors has presence to burn, but he too is poorly used, except for the early flashbacks where he and Janet collaborate to repair his ship.  As Kang the Conqueror, as he comes to call himself, however, he just glowers and curls his lips contemptuously while making threats.  There is multiplication in the cards for both characters, but to reverse the old phrase, in this case more turns out to be less, especially in a movie where the math runs to Quantum Realm times Multiverse.  The result goes the chaotic “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” one better. Elsewhere both Pfeiffer and Douglas appear to be walking through the film trying to keep a straight face, while Murray just does his usual shtick, content to do as little as possible to collect what was probably a big paycheck, though he does arch an eyebrow at one point.  Newton seems a pleasant girl, but she tries too hard; as a result Cassie is irritating rather than endearing, and Scott’s “Where is Cassie?” refrain becomes nearly unbearable after a while.  It’s Stoll who actually comes off best as the malevolent but absurd MODOK, though even those who find the character amusing may cringe when he becomes the object of what passes for a jokey moral—“It’s never too late to stop being a dick.” Of course the movie is opulent visually, but while the effects are big, they’re woefully short of the wonder they aim for, and neither the production design (Will Htay) nor the costumes (Sammy Sheldon Differ) create a sense of awe.  Bill Pope’s cinematography fails to meld the live action and CGI convincingly—there seems to be a lot of green screen work here, perfunctorily done—and though editors Adam Gerstel and Laura Jennings have delivered a cut that actually comes in at well under two hours if you ignore the opening and closing credits, the result still seems interminable.  Christophe Beck’s bombastic score adds to the sense of heaviness. In the end “Quantumania” simply lacks the lighthearted touch director Peyton Reed brought to the first two Ant-Man movies; it’s a heavy slog, more akin to most of the other MCU pictures than to its more genial predecessors.  That probably derives from its place as the inaugural installment of what’s called Phase 5 of that cinematic universe, in which—if the two end-credit preview scenes are any indication—Kang will play a major role (pun intended).  As such MCU cultists, who revel in the minutiae of the blockbuster movies and array of related Disney+ TV series that make up the intricate storyline being cobbled together, will embrace it; it might be about a guy who shrinks down to ant size, but it will no doubt be a big hit. Occasional viewers who don’t devote themselves obsessively to how everything is interrelated in this long-running, increasingly convoluted comic-book extravaganza will likely be more bored than enthralled, and wonder how long this epic-sized fantasy can be sustained.  Another laughable line that stands out here comes toward the start, when the folks from above are encouraged to quaff down a liquid that will serve as a sort of universal language translator with the words “Drink the ooze.”  If one’s unkind, that injunction might make you think of the kool-aid Disney’s serving about this whole MCU enterprise being fun and inventive; increasingly it’s not, as this frantic but tedious entry demonstrates. "
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Humble MCU franchise spreads its wings&#44; delivers big-time villain&#44; thrills&#46;
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE," ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA. With Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jonathan Majors. Screenplay by Jeff Loveness. Directed by Peyton Reed. Rated PG-13 for violence/action, and language. 125 minutes. In theaters. “My favorite thing about the ‘Ant-Man’ movies is that nobody has to save the world,” he wrote so naively, a mere five years ago in this space. The first couple of Marvel’s breezy, low-stakes caper comedies served as palate cleansers between the franchise’s bigger, more bombastic affairs, with director Peyton Reed bringing a bright pop sensibility and a welcome lack of consequence to the proceedings. These were movies you could sit back and enjoy without having to keep track of fifteen other films’ worth of backstories and convoluted continuity. We never knew how good we had it. ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA is not a movie so much as a scaffolding site for what Marvel publicists (paid and unpaid) are calling “Phase 5,” which I presume is supposed to fool us into thinking these films are building to anything beyond the perpetuation of more Marvel product. There’s no longer any difference between the coming attractions and the feature, as we saw last year with the depressingly disappointing “Wakanda Forever,” in which what seemed like a sincere attempt to mourn star Chadwick Boseman was continually interrupted by a backdoor pilot for a Disney Plus series about a plucky teenager who builds her own Iron Man suit. These days, the world’s largest entertainment franchise is capable only of churning out advertisements for itself. But why must these ads look so crummy and cheap? “Quantumania” takes place almost entirely within the Quantum Realm, a subatomic dimension somewhere far beneath our own where every background is the world’s ugliest screensaver. Returning stars Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, and Michelle Pfeiffer – along with Kathryn Newton as Rudd’s rebellious teenage daughter – get sucked down and stranded in this micro-universe With lots of exposition and little in the way of logic, they’re split up and set about chasing meaningless MacGuffins while establishing plot points for future films. Disney has warned critics that we’re operating under something called a “spoiler embargo” until the 24th of February, but I honestly have no idea how we’d even be able to spoil a movie in which nothing really happens. I guess the point of the project is to establish Jonathan Majors as the franchise’s next big baddie, Kang the Conqueror, a “more Thanos than Thanos” villain who speaks in softly measured tones about murdering millions. Majors is a wonderful actor who can manage to be menacing even in these silly costumes, but even after the ponderous monologuing I’m still not sure what Kang’s whole deal is supposed to be. He does, however, have a long history with Pfeiffer’s character that she somehow never got around to mentioning to her husband, daughter or superhero son-in-law. (Most of the movie’s plot machinations rely on Pfeiffer keeping secrets for no good reason. I feel like an honest conversation could have gotten us all home an hour earlier.) It’s so sad to watch stars of Douglas and Pfeiffer’s stature in schlock like this, wandering around hideous CGI backdrops, obviously unsure of what they’re supposed to be looking at. The previous pictures made use of Douglas’ crackerjack comic timing, whereas here he’s reduced to repeating the punchline “I like ants” with a disarming sincerity and disappearing for large swaths of screen time. “Rick And Morty” writer Jeff Loveness supplies some gooey alien creatures making lame, single-entendre jokes about having “holes” during sub-“Guardians of the Galaxy” knock-offs of the cantina scene from “Star Wars” that play like copies of a copy. Much missed is Michael Pena’s motormouthed sidekick, or any of director Reed’s peppy personality. “Quantumania” is anonymous hackwork, the actors shot in overlit singles, standing around in front of volume screens and trying to keep their eyelines straight. Much like last year’s abysmal “Thor: Love And Thunder,” the film feels sutured together from footage of people who were never in the same place at the same time. (Put it this way, if Michael Douglas has met Bill Murray, it sure wasn’t on the set of this movie.) The quality of special effects in these films has plummeted so precipitously it comes off as an act of arrogance for a $200 million movie to look this lousy. The indolence extends to the screenplay level, building to a big sacrifice – which like most sacrifices in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is instantly reversed – and mawkish declarations of love between two characters who haven’t had a single scene together. Over the past two decades, Sean Burns’ reviews, interviews, and essays have appeared in WBUR’s The ARTery, Philadelphia Weekly, The Improper Bostonian, Metro, The Village Voice, Rolling Stone and RogerEbert.com.

"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE," Maybe this is what we're all just doing now, making movies like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Maybe we all just accept it. Can we all just accept it? Could we? We'd all sleep better, I promise you that much. Who's complaining? Not me. I mean, I don't feel I'm in any position to complain, because as a little nerdy kid, a movie like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was precisely what I wished for. Longed for. Ached for. Me, and hundreds of thousands of little nerdy kids like me. Well. Hear me, my nerdy people: Look around you! I speak to you today in this, the year 2023 Common Era, wherein all of us, as a culture, find ourselves standing three-deep into an actual, honest-to-God Ant-Man film franchise. Even more mind-boggling: This third Ant-Man film posits the purple, time-traveling despot Kang the Conqueror as a bad guy to take seriously. And the filmmakers have dutifully imported him and his whole goofy-as-hell outfit, more or less intact from the comics page. But don't stop there, because whom should Kang have henching for him than the even goofier-than-hell M.O.D.O.K, the Mental (or possibly Mechanical) Organism Designed Only for Killing. Yes, that M.O.D.O.K — the giant head in the floaty chair with the dangly arms and legs. And we're supposed to take him seriously, too — or semi-seriously, as screenwriter Jeff Loveness is clearly one of us and knows how to make a gleefully silly character like M.O.D.O.K work, at least. But as I sat there watching Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, I started to wonder if perhaps, back when we as nerdy little kids wished for it, all those long years ago, someone snuck a monkey's paw into the whole affair. How else to explain how tirelessly, how doggedly, the film kept insisting that nothing I was witnessing remotely mattered — not simply to the cacophonous macrocluster of corporate content called the MCU, but to...much of anything, really? Most of the film takes place at a far remove from the Marvel Universe we know, down in the subatomic Quantum Realm that characters from previous films have visited (Ant-Man), gotten stuck in for decades (Ant-Man and the Wasp) or used as a series of temporal highway bypasses on their way to saving the universe (Avengers: Endgame). This time out, it's the entire Ant-Family that gets sucked down into the MCU's own microscopic Whoville, with its sunless, surreal, slimy Color Out of Space production design. There's Scott/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), his girlfriend Hope/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), Hope's father Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Hank's wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Scott's teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton). There, they quickly befriend the woefully interchangeable locals, including Krylar (smarmily smarmed by Bill Murray), who are fighting against the evil Kang (Jonathan Majors) to save their cavernous, entirely and egregiously CGI home. A word about the CGI of it all: Look, as I say, maybe it's time to concede already, to just collectively agree that we'll move the goalposts and abandon any expectation that these movies will ever, should ever, can ever look like they were made by actors actually working together, or at least vaguely proximal to each other, on the same soundstage, at the same time. Consider: The film features a brief scene in which Douglas, Pfeiffer and Murray sit around a table at a bar. You look at that scene and you think, here are three Hollywood stars who've been around for five decades. They could have made a film together at any time during that period and now, finally, here they are and here it is. When we eventually get a The Making Of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, we might well learn that those three actors actually filmed that scene together. But in absolutely no way does it look like they did, and it sure as hell doesn't feel like they did. And that's what matters. You know: Those imperious jerks who've spent decades now peering down their noses at superhero movies, who've clucked their tongues and stroked their beards and dismissed the appeal of these films, waving them off as mere cartoons? I've fought against them, one way or another, my entire adult professional life — but what if, in one narrow sense at least, they're right? What if they've had the answer all along? Let's look at the evidence. The characters of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, at least, are flat. Breathtakingly so. Take Scott Lang, as played by Paul Rudd. In previous Ant-Man films, we may all have looked past the thinness of his characterization, because the charming Ruddishness of the performance blinded us to it. But as depicted here, Scott's entire personality, the whole of his character, is defined thus: ""I love my daughter Cassie. Where is Cassie? What have you done with Cassie?"" (Seriously, no time or effort is spent on Hope's motivation or characterization, she's just sort of ... there. In the mix onscreen. She might as well be one of the CGI barstools.) Majors gets several scenes to explain — declaim, technically — what Kang's all about, yet still I came away from the film with no concrete idea of what Kang's all about. But what if we all just agree to accept it? To categorize these films as cartoons? After all, the people who make cartoons are famously never in the same place together. The voice actors record their tracks in separate sound booths at separate times. The animation work is shipped overseas. Perhaps that would explain why, at so many points in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, characters keep running or jumping or nearly falling off ledges and all the while your brain just floats up there in your cranium with its brainy arms crossed, flatly refusing to accept any of what you're seeing at all — the running, the jumping, even the baseline existence of the ledges themselves. Hello. I am here today to talk to you about the actress Michelle Pfeiffer's wig in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. You make movies for a living, so I know you realize how they work. You know that when this film gets shown on that big screen, my gal Micky P's forehead is going to be six feet high. Later, it's gonna get beamed into our living rooms in ultra crisp plasma super hyper mega HD, or whatever. We can also see how parched and thirsty that poor wig is. There is, I'm sorry to say, simply no excuse for any of this, none. But look, there's an answer. It's too late to save the wig in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania -- but for future reference, just know that I'm happy to meet with you, and your accountants and go over the spreadsheets, because I'm telling you that you can fix this. Just look at the standard line item in the budget for, say, the Mysterious Glowing Object That's Terribly Terribly Important To Everyone In Whichever Marvel Movie This Happens To Be — in this case, that yellow orb thingy with all those metal rings flying around inside it that Kang wants, for reasons I can't remember now. No, yeah, it does look great, I agree. Not my point. Because imagine what would happen if you reallocated a tiny amount from that budget line — just enough to take its CGI glowiness down a few lumens that no one would notice anyway — so that your teams of professionals could set to work sprinkling some of their CGI fairy dust along the top of Michelle's forehead and obscure the wig line. That's it. That one, tiny thing is literally all you have to do. No one's saying you need to futz with your Hair and Makeup Team at all. It's not their fault, it's yours; they're all doing a great job otherwise. Michael Douglas' thick mop of silver foxiness looks great, bless that man's follicular genes. Rudd's hair looks great, too. (I mean, the color — maybe it's real, maybe it's Maybelline, who can say, he's not on trial here.) And you've got Evangeline Lilly sporting a short n' kicky mom-bob throughout? Perfect, no notes. Wish she hadn't lost the chunky Rachel Maddow frames she's wearing in the opening minutes, though. But here she's giving mid-'90s Annie Lennox, she's giving No more I love yous, and it works. And let's be real. You all spent a lot of time and money to write the code and power the servers to de-age Michael Douglas for just one lousy scene in a previous Ant-Man film, so a tiny bit of wig line CGI won't break you. Plus, you owe her. ... Oh and also throw in a few bucks on coconut oil while you're at it. Just to moisturize that poor wig a bit, because she looks like she hasn't had a drop to drink since the Seoul Olympics."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE," 
	When last we left the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it was at the end of the shared grieving process that was Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. While that film contained at least one character from other Marvel properties and introduced a possible new recurring character, it was mostly a pause in the grand overall storyline of the MCU.
 
	Now it’s back to regularly-scheduled programming with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, which – at long last – collides the movie and TV sides of the MCU as the beginning of its Phase 5. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is now a local folk hero in San Francisco, as his exploits with the Avengers as Ant-Man make him popular wherever he goes. His life is good with his girlfriend Hope/Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), along with mentor Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer).
 
	All of that and more is thrown into peril when an experiment with quantum mechanics by Cassie winds up sucking all five of them into the quantum realm. There they discover a vast world full of innumerable strange flora and fauna, one where pretty much everybody is afraid of a man named Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). A confrontation between Kang and the main group is inevitable, as each hopes to find a way to make it back to the “real world” on Earth.
 
	Directed once again by Peyton Reed and written by first-time feature screenwriter Jeff Loveness, the film accomplishes the feat of staying true to the goofiness of the previous Ant-Man films while still providing lots of great action and moving the overall story forward. The inventiveness of the characters – and the people/voices playing them – is constantly entertaining, whether or not you’re familiar with the comic book stories from which they originate.
 
	Despite the story taking place almost entirely in a location necessitating an overwhelming amount of CGI, the imagery holds up throughout. Perhaps it’s because everything except the humans is computer-generated, but the graphics never “feel” fake, which makes all the difference in accepting the story at face value. Even better, the main showdowns feature the actual actors facing off instead of ones where the CGI does all the work.
 
	Also helping matters is the (re)introduction of Kang, previously seen in the Disney+ series Loki. As played by Majors, he is menacing in all the best ways, charismatic enough to be appealing but mean enough to want to see his demise. And Majors doesn’t try to overplay his hand; instead of hamming it up, he uses subtle facial expressions and hand gestures to show that Kang doesn’t need to do much to exert his power.
 
	Each of the main actors are once again a delight to watch. Rudd is the ideal everyman, even when doing superheroic things. Lilly is a great counterpart, complementing Rudd while showing her own strengths. Douglas and Pfeiffer are not just along for the ride, using their Oscar-nominated acting skills to class up the Marvel film. Newton, now the third version of Cassie, is a great addition to the cast and fits in very well.
 
The first of three MCU movies in 2023, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania bodes well for Marvel's plans for the future. There can be a lot of fatigue going through the seemingly never-ending superhero saga, but if they continue to be of this quality, fans will keep flocking back to movie theaters.

"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL," El Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel (UCM) comienza un nuevo ciclo de películas y series para profundizar el multiverso y los saltos temporales que tanto Spiderman: sin camino a casa (Spiderman: no way home, 2021) como Doctor Strange en el multiverso de la locura (Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, 2022) iniciaron. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) disfruta de la calma, pero se pregunta: ""¿Qué más se viene para él como héroe?"". En una reunión familiar junto a su hija Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Hank (Michael Douglas) y Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), sin quererlo, abren un portal al mundo cuántico que los absorbe sin mediar resistencia. A partir de allí, la película transcurre en un lugar desconocido para los protagonistas (y para los espectadores), repleto de criaturas extrañas, seres poderosos y plena incertidumbre. Luego del primer acto, el cual nos plantea el conflicto para nuestros héroes, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania (2023) navega entre el buen despliegue visual y las débiles decisiones de guión. Representar el mundo cuántico sostenía todo un reto fotográfico y, en esto, su resolución es efectiva.  Sin embargo, cada obstáculo que vive Scott y compañía se resuelve de forma sencilla y perezosa, sin tanto sustento ni explicación, como si todo fuese una caricatura abstracta. Las situaciones no son palpables y los dilemas carecen de carga emocional. El último acto no posee la contundencia ni la tensión dramática que muchas entregas de Marvel nos acostumbraron. Lo más destacado de la cinta es la presentación en sociedad del villano de esta nueva Fase. Kang el Conquistador, a quién ya pudimos ver en la serie Loki (de cita obligada y vínculo directo), es arrollador y temible. Jonathan Majors (5 sangres), con su carisma y fuerza, brinda la mejor interpretación de un villano dentro del UCM. Esto recién empieza para él y, aunque no tengamos claras sus intenciones, es una de las pocas cartas por las que Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania merece ser elogiada. Contar con la comicidad de Paul Rudd y tener a actores experimentados (Douglas, Pfeiffer) acompañados por el joven talento de Newton es un logro que permite ligereza a la historia. La presencia de Bill Murray (Perdidos en Tokio) como Lord Krylar, unas hormigas gigantes y la aparición de M.O.D.O.K., interpretado por Corey Stoll (Medianoche en París), son perlitas para destacar y capaces de añadir aire fresco al largometraje. Con un guión escrito por Jeff Loveness (con experiencia en algunos capítulos alocados de Rick and Morty) y bajo la dirección de Peyton Reed (al igual que en las dos anteriores entregas de Ant-Man), Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania brinda un formato convencional (humor, familia y aventura) sin asumir riesgos. Es simplista, prefiere la épica y deja de lado el compromiso de ir por más, tal como las mencionadas películas de Doctor Strange y de Spiderman consiguieron."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE," The Marvel Cinematic Universe gets its most CGI-heavy and most artificial-feeling movie yet with ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,"" a sloppy piece of world-building that takes everything that was once refreshing about Ant-Man and his place in the MCU and drowns it in garish green screen nonsense. ""Quantumania"" is the Marvel entry that most resembles a ""Star Wars"" movie, in its setting and introduction of characters and creatures — including one guy who is a literal walking stalk of broccoli — that are not of this Earth. Those deeply immersed in the mythology of either the Marvel comics or the periphery of the MCU may be mildly amused; normies and casual Marvel watchers can feel free sitting this one out. Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang, the divorced ex-con and former Baskin Robbins employee turned Avenger who has the ability to shrink down to ant size or grow himself to be as tall as the Eiffel Tower. Life is swell — he's just written a tell-all book, ""Look Out for the Little Guy,"" about his world-saving adventures — and he and his partner, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), aka the Wasp, are enjoying their lives in San Francisco, taking in occasional views of the Bay from atop the Golden Gate Bridge. But then Hope's mother Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) starts talking an awful lot about the Quantum Realm, in ominous ways that let you know they're all headed there sooner than later. What is the Quantum Realm, you raise your hand and ask? It is described as ""a place outside time and space"" and ""a secret universe beneath ours,"" and Janet once spent 30 years there learning her way around the place. She's not especially stoked to return: ""You know how dangerous the Quantum Realm is"" is an actual line of dialogue she speaks, followed shortly after, in the very same scene, by a distressed, ""you're sending a signal down to the Quantum Realm?"" It is fair to say she is not altogether pleased with this development. Then it's off to the QR we go, as Ant-Man, the Wasp, Janet, Janet's husband (and ant specialist and former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent) Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Ant-Man's teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) are sucked into the netherworld via some sort of scientific accident. There, they're confronted with creatures with fireball cannons for heads, a jelly being whose drinkable goo extract allows one to hear Quantum Realm language in English, the aforementioned Broccoli man, various other entities, and Bill Murray. (Murray is playing some sort of space lord named Krylar, but for all intents and purposes he's playing Bill Murray — and flatly, at that.) The crew's goal, once they enter the Quantum Realm, is to exit. But the movie's larger piece of business is the introduction of Kang the Conqueror, ""Quantumania's"" baddie and a murderous supervillain (he has wiped out entire timelines of people, we're told and briefly shown, and is said to have killed trillions) who will hold great significance in the current Phase of Marvel films. Kang is played with a quiet menace by Jonathan Majors (""Lovecraft Country""), a forceful actor who is having a bit of a moment, who also has upcoming roles in the boxing threequel ""Creed III"" and the bodybuilder psychodrama ""Magazine Dreams."" Here, he takes a measured approach to his seething villainy, internalizing 98% of his outrage and delivering his words and actions with near-whispered tones and slight hand gestures. ""You're out of your league, Ant-Man,"" he tells Lang, dismissing his existence with such casual flippancy that he might as well be making fun of the entire movie, as well as the two that came before it. Those previous films, for what it's worth, were a lot more fun than ""Quantumania."" They were designed and almost played as both an antidote to and a flex on the Marvel formula up to that point: if they could make a character as minor as ""Ant-Man"" work, what couldn't they do? But the small stakes and real-world feel of those films is gone in ""Quantumania,"" which is shot almost entirely on green screens, and has nothing tangible or tactile about it. Director Peyton Reed, his action taking place almost entirely in the tiny universe of the Quantum Realm, even has difficulty rendering the size of his characters, switching between microscopic and giant so often that everything blurs together. And that's without even mentioning the M.O.D.A.K. character, a giant floating head outfitted with tiny arms and tiny legs, played by Corey Stoll, his head is stretched out and made to look like a disturbing special effects test gone wrong. Everything besides the introduction of Kang feels perfunctory, and an MCU entry (this is No. 31, if you're keeping score) has never felt so rudderless. The usual stabs at humor fall short against such a phony looking and feeling backdrop, the themes of family never run any deeper than ""family: you love them, even when you don't!"" and Michael Peña, a presence in the first two films but gone here, is missed. ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" kicks off the MCU's fifth phase of storytelling, coming off a beleaguered Phase 4 where enthusiasm, action and the general good vibes of the series started to flag. Rather than starting anew, this feels like more of the same, and the way it plays with the rules of time and space make even the rickety ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" feel coherent."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE," That’s the highest profile release of the week, but an even better option is to check out Amazon Prime’s second — and final — season of “Carnival Row.” Or, if you’re not into steampunk/fantasy series, plunge into the lovely romance “Of an Age.” It’s a keeper. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania”: It’s best to approach Marvel Studios’ latest release as if it’s a stepping stone for more compelling comic-book mayhem ahead. In other words, it’s good, not great. Loaded with special effects but showing more restraint than the CGI orgy we saw in “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” the film’s best sequences center on human interactions. This “Ant-Man” puts the human factor first in its opening moments as the proud Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd, charming as ever) strolls along Bay Area streets, where he catches the fancy of everyone around him. Having just released a self-help/autobiography “Look Out for the Little Guy” (a real book due Sept. 5), Scott’s life is about as sweet as a cherry pie. He’s in love with do-gooder Hope, aka the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), and is bonding more with science-nerdy daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton). But a shakeup comes to all once they get sucked into the Quantum Realm — a surreal alterna-world that looks like an amalgamation of “Star Wars,” “Tron” and other sci-fi classics. Once there, the fam gets fed all the dirt on Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), the fierce mom of the Wasp. Surprisingly, Janet is the main character and a steady anchor in the film, and Pfeiffer brings gravitas to playing a supreme badass with a wild past and an unfortunate connection with the story’s standout villain, Kang the Conqueror (portrayed with Shakespearean flourishes by the great Jonathan Majors). To spill more tea about what goes down would be a disservice. What needs to be said, though, is just how remarkable Pfeiffer and Majors are in this sequel. Whenever they’re paired onscreen, “Quantumania” catapults to a top shelf in the Marvel Universe. So it’s all the more of a killjoy when those juicy moments get followed up by stale and obvious side-notes, such as Bill Murray popping in and doing his standard Bill Murray shtick as a kinda-creepy former hookup of Janet’s. It’s boring, and adds nothing. At other times, screenwriter Jeff Loveness and Reed engage in more inventive doings, particularly when it comes to giving various return players — the now big-headed M.O.D.O.K. (Corey Stoll) and ant-lover Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) their star moments. It’s all entertaining enough, but “Quantumania” seems like an in-between enterprise, another chess move in the superhero series. The two terrific end-credit scenes hint of even better things to come. Stay. They’re worth it. Details: 2½ stars out of 4; in theaters Feb. 16. “Of an Age”: In what should wind up as one of 2023’s best and most poignant romances, two young Australian men — 18-year-old aspiring ballroom dancer Kol (Elias Anton) and graduate student Adam (Thom Green) — spend a life-changing day together in 1999 that sticks with them for years. The two are thrown together as they search for Adam’s sister Ebony (Hattie Hook) who is Kol’s friend and dance partner and has woken up after a bender on a beach somewhere and needs a ride home. Kol and Adam’s search finds them stumbling upon something of great importance. The bulk of “Of an Age” transpires in a car with telling, tight shots on the facial expressions of both guys  — the determined-to-be-straight Kol, whose Syrian family doesn’t exactly embrace homosexuality, and the out and proud Adam. Gradually they grow closer and fonder, with off-hand glances giving way to more intense gazes. We’ve seen something like this play out before in Andrew Haigh’s sexy “Weekend” and Richard Linklater’s tragicomic Ethan Hawke/Julie Delpy trilogy. “Of an Age” taps the same vein of those films with director/screenwriter Goran Stolevski (whose debut from last year, “You Won’t Be Alone,” was one of the best films of 2022) guiding the film’s sense of intimacy into something more profound, even eternal.  But there’s more here than longing, with Stolevski making a U-turn late in the film, and taking us to a staggeringly beautiful and heartbreaking destination. Details: 3½ stars; opens Feb. 17 in area theaters. “Carnival Row: Season 2”: Maybe deciding to call it quits after just two seasons was all that was needed to fire up the creative juices of showrunner Erik Oleson. The Prime Video fantasy/steampunk series’ second outing is on fire, an improvement over Season 1, which was decent but plodded at times. The pacing issues are gone and the metaphors from Season 1 remain; in fact they’re even more pointed. Orlando Bloom reprises his role as a “copper” who’s also a war veteran and partial fae — a winged creature that’s been relegated by the dominant human population to be freedom-denied refugees. Cara Delevingne returns also as independent-minded fae Vignette, a passionate defender of equal rights for all. In Season 2, the conditions and treatment of the fae have deteriorated as a nationalistic pride escalates. Sound familiar? The world-building and mythology at play in “Carnival Row” is captivating and seductive, sounding alarms about today’s world much as SyFy’s relevant, and yes better, “Battlestar Galactica” did. The effects are astonishing to behold as well. OK, so how about Season 3, already? Details: 3 stars, drops Feb. 17 on Amazon Prime. “All That Breathes”: Director Shaunak Sen’s evocatively shot documentary — the odds-on fave to win the Oscar this  year — takes us into the inspiring world of New Delhi brothers Nadeem Shehzad and Mohammad Saud. They’re valiantly trying in their makeshift avian basement to nurse back to health the black kite, an at-risk bird of prey. Although Sen’s documentary can be viewed at home, it deserves to be seen on the biggest screen imaginable. It soars as high as the birds it depicts, while telling a compassionate story of two Muslim brothers trying to do their part in making the world a better place. It’s astonishing. Details: 4 stars; now available on HBO Max. “The Blue Caftan”: Desire. Passion. Love. All of those tricky emotions create complications and trouble. Moroccan filmmaker Maryam Touzani’s gentle and compassionate second feature proves that there is no rulebook on the proper way to love and that unconditional love is the most altruistic gift you can give. Mina (Lubna Azabal) grows to understand that truth as her health worsens and her reliance on her closeted gay husband Halim (Saleh Bakri) grows stronger by the day. When the couple hires an apprentice — Youssef (Ayoub Missioui) — to help in their caftan store, a sexual awakening and reckoning comes about. Touzani’s three-character drama doesn’t pretend to have all the answers but stresses the need to think about our legacy and our capacity to go beyond ourselves to make others happy. It’s the equivalent of a cinematic poem, filled with ache, insight and exhilaration. Details; 3½ stars; in theaters Feb. 17."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,After a promising first act that featured some relatable family conflict&#44; the film falls apart by dividing our characters up in a contrived and inconsequential realm that had absent thrills and jokes that didn&#8217;t land&#46;
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL," Ant-Man (2015) and its 2018 sequel were based on the idea: What if we had a regular guy who becomes a superhero, like Peter Parker (Spider-Man) but without Parker’s emotional baggage? The resulting movies were much more fun than could be expected from seeing Rudd’s average American dad thrust into weird situations. The creative team took risks. They knew that a movie built around a tourist from the suburbs who says “wow” or “woah” when he sees anything exotic would get old fast, so they made Lang open-minded and playful. Lang took the audience along with him when he had fun with his powers of shrinking and growing. He was riding insects, dodging pets, leaping from giant mugs and spoons, stealing valuables by crawling through cracks. Those sight gags, inspired by The Borrowers (1997) and Honey, I Shrunk The Kids (1989), gave the movies a breeziness that made other Marvel films look positively grim. Hot take: The Quantum Realm offers dazzling eye candy, but the novelty does not last. And the lack of freshness continues with a threadbare plot that tries to distract from the fact this film exists mainly to introduce a new Marvel movie phase. "
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE," There’s a lot of mania in the Marvel Cinematic Universe lately, much of it coming from Disney’s ploy to force another Thanos-level, multibillion-dollar “Avengers” arc. MCU superheroes have increasingly been tumbling through alternate realities and timelines that double as infinitely malleable plot devices. For better or worse, it’s everywhere right now. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” the third entry in director Peyton Reed’s likable “Ant-Man” series that kicks off Phase 5 of the MCU, arrives Feb. 17, but it may as well have been released last year. Like 2022’s “Doctor Strange: In the Multiverse of Madness” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” it’s stuffed to groaning with trippy plotlines and excuses to trot out new versions of familiar heroes and villains. And yet, there’s a sense that the MCU’s multiverse is spinning out of control. Its thematic attempts to channel anxieties about what could have been if presidential elections, the pandemic, and other events had gone differently in recent years feel shallow. There’s a briefly glimpsed but tragically missed better world out there, the film seems to say, and Marvel’s here to make sense of our disillusionment about it. Or something like that. “Quantumania” can’t even make sense of itself as it squats over some of the most likable actors of the last couple of generations and plops perfunctory MCU duties on them.  A lazy story and clichéd dialogue by screenwriter Jeff Loveness, as well as shoehorned, baldly green-screened action sequences work against one another to confuse the tone. Director Reed manages at least to preserve co-star Michelle Pfeiffer’s smoldering intensity and Paul Rudd’s everyman charm, along with a gruff and energetic Michael Douglas and wide-eyed new-hope Kathryn Newton. Rudd again plays Scott Lang/Ant-Man, a sunnily egotistical Avenger living in San Francisco who’s still trying to earn respect for having saved the universe in 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame.” His scientist partner and co-billed Wasp, Hope van Dyne (an oddly vacant Evangeline Lilly) and her scientist mom, Janet van Dyne (Pfeiffer), are still around, as is the story’s original Ant-Man and pivotal MCU character Hank Pym (Douglas). All seems well. But not so fast! Lang’s daughter Cassie (Newton) invented a road map of sorts for the Quantum Realm, where Pfeiffer’s van Dyne also happens to have been trapped for three decades before being rescued in the last “Ant-Man” movie. After being predictably sucked back in, van Dyne’s past catches up with her as it’s revealed she was a revolutionary trying to fight the realm’s big baddie, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). She first found Kang there as an exile, having been sent to this tiny prison that exists out of time and space. And yet, everyone’s exotic land is someone else’s home, and Kang’s plan to escape hinges on the slaughter of the people already living there (a mishmash of unfortunately designed, cantina-style “Star Wars” characters). As played by the magnetic Majors, Kang is a ticking time bomb set to intimidate the MCU for years to come. But annoyingly, the movie makes far more sense if you’ve seen Majors’ first version of Kang in the final episode of the 2021 Disney+ series “Loki,” where he’s called He Who Remains. It’s a full escalation of the interwoven plots from the MCU’s films and TV shows, and seemingly a marketing choice for Disney+. Before “Multiverse of Madness” or “No Way Home,” the six-episode (and far superior) “Loki” heralded this entire arc as Kang openly described each of the ostensible spoilers in the third act of “Quantumania” (seriously) and possibly the entire Multiversal War that’s coming. One can hope that, by the time it arrives, the MCU won’t just be burglarizing “Journey to the Center of the Earth,” “Star Wars” and current Disney+ titles like “Avatar” and the animated dud “Strange World,” as it is here. There’s so much to sift through and occasionally like: a visually inspired subatomic set piece, bits of the roiling family tension among actors who are much better than their scripts. But there’s nowhere to hide from the MCU’s accelerating sprawl, no meaningful plays beyond getting to the next line. It’s fun, yes, but predictable to a fault. “There’s only one way this can go,” Kang says in “Loki,” in one of the most revealing bits of dialogue in the entire MCU. “You know you can’t get to the end until you’ve been changed by the journey. This stuff, it needs to happen to get us all in the right mindset to finish the quest.”"

There’s a lot of weight on the tiny shoulders of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). This, apparently, is the beginning of the so-called ‘phase five’ in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Phase four, from Black Widow to Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, represented a dreary period for a franchise in need of a reset. But Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is the same old formula, rather than a bold new beginning.  It’s misguided from the beginning. For one thing, giving The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) equal billing is to wildly overstate her involvement. She just buzzes at the edge of the story. The appeal of Ant-Man was always that he was the least impressive Avenger, a goofy dad who knew he shouldn’t really be there but did his very best. This tries to elevate him to a dramatic superhero. It doesn’t work. Rudd’s charm is dimmed by largely stripping him of comedy bits and there’s no fun to be had with Ant-Man’s changes in size. There’s too much man, not enough ant.  Scott Lang (Ant-Man’s alter ego) is very happy in his post-Avengers life. He, Hope (Lilly), his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), and in-laws Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) are all living cheerfully, until one of Cassie’s scientific experiments gets them all dragged into the ‘Quantum Realm’, a hidden universe of alien worlds and sentient blobs. The whole Quantum Realm lives in fear of Kang (Jonathan Majors), a being with whom Janet has a secret history.  Janet drives the plot – such as it is – drip-feeding details of her murky past excruciatingly slowly. Pfeiffer is a solid gold movie star and it’s a pleasure to see her anchoring a blockbuster again, but even she can’t turn worried side glances into narrative momentum.  And even by superhero movie standards, Quantumania is an extraordinarily CGI-heavy movie. It’s often reminiscent of the Star Wars prequels – technically impressive but soulless, with a universe that feels fake rather than lived-in. Director Peyton Reed seems lost in its brooding world.  If there’s a near-saving grace, it’s Kang, a villain with potential. He’s a multidimensional being who exists outside time. He is everywhere and will always be, like a handy metaphor for the entire MCU. The part doesn’t ask a lot of Jonathan Majors, who has already shown his star quality in Lovecraft Country and The Harder They Fall, but he finds interesting moments and there’s something chilly and occasionally frightening about the almost bored way he behaves.  There’s a lot more Majors to come in future Marvel films and he’s really the only thing here that makes a continued story look even vaguely enticing. With this functional sequel Marvel is still on a dud streak. They now have the whole multiverse to explore. But can they settle into a reality where their films are fun again?

"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE," The film is a wild superhero adventure that often feels derivative, with scenes, terrains and characters seemingly inspired by the cantina sequence in “Star Wars” and Disney’s recent “Strange World.” And, as in many of these films, family issues — in this case, a father-daughter conflict between Scott Lang-Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton) — help move the story. The movie accomplishes two goals: it delivers a lively but sometimes clunky story, and it introduces a notable Marvel villain, Kang the Conqueror, who will play a major role in future Marvel Cinematic Universe features. It seems Kang was exiled to the Quantum Realm by his other, more powerful iterations. So, with many alternate Kangs roaming throughout the multiverse, Marvel has a villain who can return and return and … well, you get it. As “Quantumania” opens, Lang is living the celebrity, good life in San Francisco, being hailed for helping save mankind, writing a best-selling book and trying to be a good single dad to his rebellious teenage daughter. The first act sets up the sitcom-like family dynamics of Lang, Cassie, Lang’s girlfriend, Hope Van Dyne, a k a, The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), her mother, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her father, scientist-inventor Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). But soon, the quintet is sucked into the Quantum Realm. Here, the script by Jeff Loveness, plays “Twister” with the dynamics of both the individual story and the needs of future projects that will include Kang. The movie veers into “Star Wars” territory with a motley band of rebels trying to overthrow the tyranny of Kang. But the humor Loveness infuses into his script keeps “Quantumania” from taking itself too seriously. Despite some flaws, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is a joy ride. Because it does not take itself too seriously, you won’t either, which is the best way to experience this latest Marvel adventure. Among the supporting players, Pfeiffer’s role is the meatiest. She spent 30 years in the Quantum Realm and, upon returning to Earth, kept much of what happened to her there from her family. The film offers some rather odd moments, One featuring Bill Murray as Lord Krylar, a Kang subordinate, — is not only strange but uncomfortable. The other features the return of Corey Stoll as Darren Cross, the villain of the original “Ant-Man,” as another Kang minion, M.O.D.O.K. For both, the movie is not their finest hour. And the script also is a bit sloppy when it comes to Kang. Supposedly, because he is “timeless,” as he says, he has the capability of seeing all futures and forseeing all scenarios. Of course, the filmmakers find a way around those circumstances. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” gets too hokey and cartoonish, especially dealing with some of the lesser characters in the Quantum Realm.

"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE," Content Warning: Photosensitive viewers may have trouble enjoying Quantumania as there are many sequences involving flashing lights. There are far more than I expected and, though I did leave the theater without a migraine, I did wake to one the following morning that’s required multiple meds to clear. Some are born into greatness; some have greatness thrust upon them. Others, accidentally steal it when they’ve been set up via a long con in order to find someone with the skillset to commit a heist and prevent their secrets from hurting the world. That third one is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), the second individual in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to bear the name Ant-Man, and the films in the Ant-Man trilogy basically possess the same energy. They are about someone who wasn’t meant to wield any kind of power finding the strength to do good when given the chance. But after playing a significant role in bringing the universe back in the battle against Thanos (Josh Brolin), what more is there for the newly-minted Avenger to do? In returning-director Peyton Reed’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, a different question of Scott is asked. No longer is it “what would you do with power,” but “what would you do when your power may not be enough?” Life post-Blip has been kind to Scott Lang. He’s got a podcast, he’s written a book talking about his experiences (all of them), and he’s reached a certain level of notoriety. He’s no longer viewed as an ex-con, but as an Avenger. But while he’s resting due to the lack of major crises to avenge, his daughter Cassie (Freaky/Supernatural’s Kathryn Newton) is out on the streets getting involved. Before their ideological differences can be discussed, Cassie reveals she’s been working on a project with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) to develop a beacon that can be sent into the quantum realm to map it. It’s a marvelous discovery with an unfortunate side effect: someone hears the beacon and pulls them in. That someone is Kang the Conqueror (The Harder They Fall’s Jonathan Majors) and he’s been waiting a long time for this opportunity and he will not be denied. By the way, there are plenty of surprises in terms of characters and twists, so be careful out there when surfing the web. What follows will be as spoiler-free as possible, but, before you continue, be advised that there are two post-credits scenes: a mid-credit and a stinger. Mileage will vary. Let’s clear one thing right up before we go any further. If you’ve seen an Ant-Man film, then you have some sense of what Quantumania, the final solo outing as we know it, will be like. Whether it was a heist film (1) or a sci-fi actioner (2), these films didn’t take themselves very seriously. Don’t believe me? Here’s Exhibit A and B. Those critical of the MCU tend to use the films’ use of humor to undercut seriousness and there are certainly some instances of this (though I’d argue far fewer than they think and they’re primarily in the ones that lean more toward the comedy or buddy action genre), but Ant-Man’s been silly from the start. These movies strike an interesting balance between the absurd and the common and do it more frequently and with greater ease merely because the films themselves are about a common person (Scott) finding himself in the extraordinary. The difference between Scott and just about any other character in the MCU is he tends toward the affable, which could very well be a result of his incarceration and divorce. He doesn’t have super strength, come from a different realm, travel the galaxy, or possess unlimited financial resources: how else could someone with an intelligent mind (he has an M.A. in electrical engineering) come to grips with losing everything? You could blame everyone else or develop into what he is. This is, of course, a theory, because we don’t know Scott prior to the start of Ant-Man, but the way he is creates fantastic opportunities that Reed and the various screenwriters have taken advantage of. In the case of Quantumania, sending someone like Scott into an area of science that’s so unknown and theorized that literally *anything* is possible is primed to be, well, astonishing, marvelous, and fantastic.

This is the first official film in the MCU’s Phase 5 and the beginning of the middle of what’s now known as The Multiverse Saga. For those having a hard time keeping up, the first three phases from Iron Man (2008) until Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019) make up what’s now known as The Infinity Saga, with the Multiverse Saga starting gently with Black Widow (2021) and kicking off more properly in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021).  Quantumania wastes very little time jumping in with the bulk of the runtime being in the quantum realm. The very beginning is used to establish where Scott is with his life and relationships before things kick off. Though Scott is typically presented as the sort who just rolls with things, Quantumania places him in a different position where the script has him explore what his role is as a hero and how that jives with his relationship with his daughter. In the prior two films, Cassie (played by the scene-stealing Abby Ryder Fortson) was far younger and couldn’t really go out on adventures. So, what does it look like for Scott when his daughter, who has always idolized him, now challenges the way Scott wants to live and keep her safe. It’s a slight mirroring of the Hank/Hope dynamic in Ant-Man 1, but without the animosity. This decision is what gives Scott his internal arc and it’s one that is likely going to serve a strong purpose down the line as reins are surely to be passed off as Rudd and his generation of actors are slowly removed to make way for the Young Avengers characters, many of whom are already being established in other films and Disney+ series. Another plus: watching the imagination at work in the production and character designs within the quantum realm, all I could think is “Guardians crawled so that Ragnarok could walk so that this could run.” To that end, with the absence of rules or logic to be beholden to, everywhere that Team Ant-Man goes feels like some kind of trip beyond the realm of Wonderland. There are several characters that audiences are going to come away loving or want more from, and not in a toy-way, but as in to get to know them. One such character is that of Katy O’Brian’s Jentorra, a rebel leader who has lost far too much by battling Kang. We don’t spend as much time as we would like learning about her as the film has too much to explore already, but screenwriter Jeff Loveness (Rick and Morty/Miracle Workers) at least does her the service of not being rescued by the Lang/Pym team, thereby avoiding a problematic white savior storyline. Instead, time with Jentorra is often used to establish more things about the world of the quantum realm, enabling Loveness and Reed to add some hefty weight to the background of the battle between Lang and Kang in the expected big confrontation. The issues, however, are several. There’s the not-their-fault fact that audiences are now oversaturated with science fiction of some kind or another where almost every big budget tale feels like a rip-off of something else. Whole scenes and segments in Quanumania give off the same vibe as pick-something from Star Wars, though one specific portion felt entirely influenced by The Rise of Skywalker (2019) as well as recent animated release Strange World (2022). These details are compliments when used sparingly and inventively and less-so when they come off as knock-offs. There are portions of sequences where the CG doesn’t come across as concrete as intended and where the action becomes hard to follow, and, well, the problems outweigh and distract from the inspired. There are two specific sequences in the film which, if the scenes were reordered, would carry far more weight and enhance the tone of either the film at-large or the sequence. One thing that’s worth mentioning that spoils nothing is that Kang is spoken of primarily as “Him” and it takes a while before He’s introduced, except we, the audience, have been introduced to him even if we don’t know his name. So having the characters speak of him in hushed tones does illustrate the fear he imposes on others, but, after a while, it starts to stand out as a means of seeking to build tension where none exists. L-R: Michael Douglas/Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne, and Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp in Marvel Studios’ ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA. Photo by Jay Maidment. © 2022 MARVEL. Gratefully, all of this changes when Majors steps on the screen. The man is a force. He doesn’t prattle like Loki (Tom Hiddelston), he doesn’t have the size of Thanos, and yet each word, each movement is so concentrated that one grows uncomfortable whenever he even looks at a single member of Team Ant-Man. Someone like Majors engrains Kang, a character audiences may be less familiar with, providing an introduction that should draw fear at his next appearance (we will see him again as the currently slated May 2nd, 2025, Avengers film is titled The Kang Dynasty). Knowing that he’s coming, seeing what he’s capable of, should cause us to pause in the same way that it causes Lang to stop cracking jokes. Kang isn’t funny and Majors makes a meal out of each moment. Now, for those who are up on the LOKI Disney+ series, Kang is a variant (or version of Kang from a different timeline/dimension), but this is not that man. Unfortunately, because there is no expectation that audiences will have seen the six-episode series (Season 2 arriving soon), there’s a great deal of time spent in the film establishing him and the rules, thereby making much of Quantumania feel exposition-heavy. Thankfully, everything else makes up for it. Frankly, though, Quantumania is a stellar time. Audiences finally get to see our central characters working together in a hero capacity, enabling Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne, Lilly, and Rudd to play off each other in ways we haven’t seen. Most importantly, neither Pfeiffer nor Lilly find their characters reduced to service the story. In truth, much of the success or failure within the narrative lies with Jane and Hope’s leadership and Hank and Scott’s willingness to follow their leads. It’s done without fanfare or argument, demonstrating trust between them. It’s fantastic to see and newbie Newton holds her own, bringing her version of Cassie Lang to life. Add to that some truly trippy sequences, some genuine excitement, and the characteristic laughs the Ant-Man films offer, and Quantumania is a strong start to Phase 5."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL," Kicking off their 2023 slate as well as Marvel’s newest phase, Ant-Man and the Wasp in Quantumania was promised to be an important piece of the future puzzle. This adventure begins with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) or Ant-Man as we know him getting sucked into the Quantum Realm with The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and the rest of the Pym family. Inside of the Quantum Realm, Quantumania introduces us to Marvel’s newest big bad – Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who we were briefly introduced to a version of in Disney +’s Loki. But is this really the essential viewing that it’s said to be?  For a sense of getting to know Kang, his motives, the lore that surrounds him as well as getting a taste of what the Avengers might have to face up against in the coming movies, it does feel like we’re gearing up to something exciting. Kang is clearly going to make for an exciting successor to Thanos as Majors delivers every line of the dialogue with a frighteningly charismatic malice, which is quite the accomplishment given the script is overall…not great. After the tight writing on Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, it’s disappointing to see Quantumania venture straight back into Thor: Love & Thunder lows of silliness, though more jokes do thankfully land here. Things pick up in the second half when we get more scenes with Kang as well as Michelle Pfeiffer’s Janet Van Dyne. Paul Rudd is as charming as ever, but though she hasn’t had a chance to shine up until now, it really is Pfeiffer who does most of the heavy lifting in terms of her fellow protagonists. Unfortunately, newcomer Kathryn Newton as the grown up Cassie Lang (Ant-Man’s daughter) fails to leave much of an impression and while Lilly has some brief moments is ultimately given very little to do as The Wasp this time round.  But the most unforgivable character choice and possibly the worst aspect of the whole movie is side-villain MODOK, who we saw a brief glimpse of in the trailer. Without giving too much away MODOK will go down as one of the most baffling choices Marvel has made in a while and it really does a disservice to the great work done with Kang, especially in scenes they share together. While the VFX isn’t bad, Quantumania loses a lot of what makes Ant-Man Ant-Man, with very little set around the usual streets of San Francisco and instead we get a gorgeous but ultimately forgettable green screen affair that has very little that makes it uniquely Ant-Man or even Quantum Realm feeling and could have been placed in Doctor Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor or even Star Wars. Ultimately, it’s an easy enough watch and there is some great stuff here, but it’s also frustratingly difficult to ignore the bad. If you’re a fan of the MCU, it’s worth watching for Pfeiffer and Kang alone as well as two very exciting post-credits scenes."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE," There's a predictable mix of fan, fun, and family vibes in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but it's a mix that's stirred a bit too long. Hope Van Dyne, a.k.a. The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and Scott Lang, The Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) are now a modern family, dealing with the growing pains of Scott's teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). Bright as her father and just as reckless, she's the apple of her grandparents' eyes, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). Cassie, as we remember from the second film, was rescued from exile in the Quantum Realm, a sub-atomic universe beneath our own. It's no surprise, given the title and trailer, that the new family accidentally find themselves in the Quantum Realm. We also know that the villain in this case is none other than the infinite Kang the Conqueror, who we were first introduced to in the TV series, Loki. Though we can also enjoy and all agree on the magnificent visual smorgasbord of CGI effects, settings and creatures, by this time, it's expected in a Marvel film. Again, no surprise there. Sadly, with all this known, there's really very little to surprise at all in this film. This is another reminder of why we miss Stan Lee. There is some typical parent versus teen angst in the story but given the titanic proportions of the settings and characters in this realm, that gets submerged in light of the action. In fact, that winds up falling a little bit flat. 1) Character Motivations. Despite their unique abilities, the heroes were still relatable because they had real-life issues. For instance, they couldn't make the rent, or they had romantic problems. They were human beings first and super-beings second. In this film, there is an attempt to include these very understandable character motivations (ie: repressed trauma, parenting, identity, etc.), but they just aren't handled well and the characters lose credibility as a result. This is well-disguised by the type of wisecracking humour we've seen in the previous films, but that does a disservice to the appreciation of the characters. 2) The Unknown. What Stan Lee did for his readers was to give them unknown places in which his stories took place. He took concepts that were generally unfamiliar to his readers and spun them into all sorts of fantastic and romantic dimensions. Of course, we are talking about two different audiences. The readers of the 1960's are far less cosmopolitan than their counterparts in this century. Having grown up on these characters and their stories for about 60 years, there is really very little that we can be surprised by. This story is, admittedly, about the unknown. The Quantum Realm is a place of mystery to Hank Pym, Scott Lang, and Hope Van Dyne, but its speculation isn't fully unknown to the audience. This audience can grasp the concept without any difficulty. Of course, that removes some of the wonder. While predictable, it’s still an acceptable premise and how this conceit succeeds is by the treatment it is given by the filmmakers. Thankfully, it gets decent treatment as it's an artistically beautiful film, as mentioned before. It's an intense, kaleidoscopic experience that presents the Quantum Realm in a fantastic way. The characters we meet, while providing a bit of comic relief, are also well-imagined. Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) is a thoroughly convincing villain. Though not as possessed of the same gravitas as Thanos the Titan, he still manages to provide enough of a threat that the audience can understand and a different one from the Kang we met in Loki. The story is a but slow at times, usually during dialogue as the character motivations try to get resolved. The humour and special effects come to the rescue during these moments and manage to carry the story along. However, with all this said, it's still a relatively fun, simple film that will entertain audiences and contribute to the canon of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You know, like it's supposed to do? Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Directed by Peyton Reed. Starring: Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Jonathan Majors, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Kathryn Newton, David Dastmalchian, Katy O’Brien, William Jackson and Bill Murray. In theatres February 17."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL," Like many in the Marvel pantheon, Ant-Man is a character that works best when he's paired with others rather than shouldering the story by himself. Paul Rudd is at his heart an improv player, relentlessly riffing off others and trying to pinch out the best in any given scene. You only need to look at the outtakes of 'Anchorman 2' - arguably the best part of that movie - to see what he can do with a free hand. That's why 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' is disappointing for both fans of Paul Rudd's work and Marvel. The movie is essentially a prelude to the next big bad of Marvel, Kang, played by Jonathan Majors. The pretext of exploring the quantum realm is wafer-thin when it looks more like AI-generated images of 'Star Wars' than anything else. Throw in a few side characters wearing capes and masks and you've got a bland episode of 'The Mandalorian'. Majors is the star of the movie, as you can see Rudd, Lilly, Douglas and Pfeiffer all seem pretty checked out of things and who can blame them when the script is this bare? All of the best scenes are given to Majors, and to be fair, he does some great work. Channelling James Earl Jones circa 'Conan the Barbarian', all haughty tones and blazing eyes, Majors brings a real screen presence in an otherwise rote and unremarkable movie. It goes without saying that 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' feels like the wrong movie to launch Kang with larger audiences. The weirdness of the character aside - he's actually multiple versions of the same person - the best part of Ant-Man generally was his light-hearted nature. 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', for all of its faults, understood this. It was a screwball comedy with a huge special effects budget. Evangeline Lilly and Paul Rudd were playing rom-com leads with super-suits. It's quite telling how at sea Marvel really is at the moment, given how 'Avengers: Endgame' felt like such a natural conclusion to the whole thing and how people are looking further out to 'X-Men' and 'Fantastic Four' than they are to characters like Kang, MODOK, and so on. Rudd, in particular, feels like he's been neutered in this. Sure, he's given a few moments to make something funny - a Scott Lang variant that's an upbeat Baskin Robbins server, for example - but he's mostly just acting alongside CGI characters and staring off into the distance. Kathryn Newton is precocious and smart, sure, but there's barely enough of a character there to be interested in while Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas are reduced down to the B-plot, Pfeiffer in particular as exposition and narrator. Bill Murray turns up for one scene and looks just totally out of place and not in a fun way. Corey Stoll does much better, as does David Dastmalchian voicing a gelatinous blob called Veb. 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' isn't terrible. It's not actively awful in any kind of meaningful way, because it's not remarkable enough to be that. Instead, it's a filler episode in the TV-ification of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's fine if you miss it, because the next episode/movie will catch you up on it."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL," Peyton Reed’s Ant-Man films have been something of a safe harbor in the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe: charmingly low-stakes outings amid the apocalyptic stakes of the wider franchise. Amid their visually homogenized peers, their clever sight gags of rapidly shifting scale and unabashed Silver Age goofiness have marked Reed’s two MCU entries as some of the few contemporary superhero films to feel affectionate rather than self–conscious about their comic-book origins. But the demands of the Marvel machine come for all its properties eventually, and it falls to Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania to offer the first real direction in the MCU’s overarching narrative since Avengers: Endgame. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), partner Hope (Evangeline Lilly), and their shared family find themselves sucked into the subatomic Quantum Realm seen in glimpses in previous installments. There, they must contend with Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a dimension-hopping tyrant seeking to escape from this surreal prison after being exiled there for his rampages across time and space. Almost immediately, the movie buckles under the pressure to simultaneously deal with Kang’s threat and establish him for future movies as the official new Big Bad of the MCU. It doesn’t help that Kang scarcely feels different from Thanos despite Majors’s attempts to add shades of calculating omniscience beyond the previous archenemy’s brute force. Kang forces Scott and the rest into a fetch quest to retrieve the means of his escape in a manner that recalls much of the Infinity Stone hunting of the last Avengers movies.  While the Quantum Realm felt strange and unique in earlier, briefer views, here is quickly falls in line with much of Marvel’s recent CGI output: splashy but nondescript, all psychedelic purple clouds and gargantuan, brutalist military buildings that homogenize every location in a universe of seemingly  infinite possibility. The action is similarly blown up from the franchise’s erstwhile emphasis on Scott’s quick-timing size changes in one-on-one fights to the kind of overwhelming but incoherent spectacle that defines nearly all superhero movie third acts. And where the earlier Ant-Man films wrung comedy out of Rudd’s easygoing charm and a relatively earnest banter compared to the irony of other Marvel movies, Quantumania is clearly informed by writer Jeff Loveness’s tenure on Rick & Morty. Jokes tend to consist of repeating phrases over and over in the cadence of that show’s deliberately shoddy improvisation, and the various creatures encountered by the heroes are filtered through its vulgar imagination, such as a gelatinous being who openly envies the humans’ orifices. This tackiness even carries over to how the film develops its themes. At the start of the story, Scott’s daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), urges her father out of his post-Thanos complacency that people still need help in the world. It’s a simple but effective bit of comic-book optimism. By the end, though, that message has been corrupted into the cruder, blunter statement “don’t be a dick” – an oddly glib note on which to end a story about a lesser superhero learning to recommit himself to the greater good.

"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL," The Boss wrote and recorded that song some 35 years before the first Ant-Man movie, in 2015, which introduced fans of the Marvel Comics character to Paul Rudd as the pizza employee, doting dad and petty thief who ends up with a high-tech, form-fitting super-suit that can shrink him down to become an insect-size do-gooder. Just like real-life ants who can engineer and construct entire mega-colonies, form themselves en masse into bridges and boats, lift up and carry up to 5,000 times their body weight, and (of course) change the course of picnics, Ant-Man is a teeny-tiny “small thing.” But he’s become a big player in the Marvel movie franchise. Quantumania is the third in the Ant-Man movie franchise, and as the title suggests, it takes place in the “quantum realm,” a hidden dimension in the sprawling Marvel multiverse that’s only accessible through dark sorcery or weird science. Quantum-ville is like Oz buzzing on super steroids and maybe some crystal meth, an explosively colorful place of breathtaking awesomeness, unfathomable peril and outrageous oddity—like Alice in Wonderland crossed with Mad Max: Fury Road, Lord of the Rings, Dune and the cantina scene from Star Wars, with a dash of Terry Gilliam’s fanciful Monty Python whimsy. Giant snails are used like horses, there’s a character who looks like a walking stalk of broccoli, and an army of minions with heads that resemble light bulbs. And another character (Carey Stoll) is practically all head. And this being a marvel movie, there are some very high stakes—not just the fate of the universe, but the fate of the multiverse and all universes, existence itself. Director Peyton Reed, who’s steered both previous Ant-Man movies, keeps the ka-pow factor high and the tone bounding giddily between high tragedy and quippy silliness. The fate of everything may hang in the balance, but even in the quantum realm, inappropriate, selfish, annoying behavior is still known as a dick move. And rest assured, you’ll see the movie’s superbad bad guy, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors—from The Last Black Man in San Francisco, Lovecraft Country, Devotion) again. Dudes who want to rule the world, and more, aren’t easily dissuaded or dismissed. Like Taylor Swift tells us, haters gonna hate. And conquerors gonna conq. It’s a wild rush of heady stuff, but such is the Marvel way, which connects everything in Quantumania to the larger MCU (that’s the Marvel Cinematic Universe), a sort of multi-dimensional superhero realm for the interconnectivity of film properties based on Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Avengers, Dr. Strange, Deadpool, Spider-Man and other characters rooted in Marvel comic-book ink. I won’t get into the cosmic weeds of all the mind-bending details, but in this latest adventure, Scott Lang (pssst—he’s really Ant-Man) is sucked into the quantum realm (in case you forget what it’s called, it’s mentioned about a dozen times in the first 10 minutes of the film). He’s accompanied by Hope van Dyne (the returning Evangeline Lilly), whose superhero alter ego is the Wasp, and Hope’s brainiac-scientist parents (Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas, also reprising their roles). Kathryn Newton (Little Big Lies, Freaky, Supernatural) comes aboard as Pym’s young-adult daughter, Cassie, whose social activism keeps getting her in trouble on Main Street USA but well suits her for what she’ll end up doing alongside revolutionaries in the quantum realm. This supersized, noisy and sometimes chaotic superhero adventure won’t be for everyone—particularly those who like their movies smaller, quieter, a bit more subtle and with less blowout spectacle, and fewer ants. But for Marvel fans, it’s the latest mega-movie about a teeny character doing tremendous good, on a massive stage across space and time. Small things lead to big things—in a Springsteen song, or in the MCU’s multiverse, anything is possible. Ant-Man is an everyman hero, movie manes never get mussed, and Paul Rudd can truly do everything, everywhere, all the time, all at once."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL," Although Paul Rudd’s bite-sized hero Ant-Man has been part of the bigger Avengers films, his own solo adventures have been relatively low-key. Director Peyton Reed chose small-scale heist thrillers over big superhero spectacle and this has always been the franchise’s strength.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the third Ant-Man film, changes all that. It officially kickstarts Marvel’s Phase V of films and gives us its next big bad: Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror.  At the beginning of the film, life is good for Scott Lang. He’s universally loved as Ant-Man and he has somewhat mended his relationship with his daughter Cassie (superb Kathryn Newton). But the Quantum Realm, the dangerous realm from where the gang rescued Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), still poses a significant threat, especially after the entire gang gets sucked into it after Cassie builds a device that sends a signal into the time void.  Once there, Scott, Cassie, Janet, Hank Pym (wonderfully grumpy Michael Douglas) and the titular Wasp, Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) must face Kang, who has some unfinished business with Janet and has become the unofficial emperor of the Quantum Realm. Quantumania is big, loud and often quite confusing. While the narrative is pretty straight-forward and Jeff Loveness’ script constantly reminds you what each character is trying to do at any given moment, the frame itself is jam-packed with funky creatures, bright lights and of course, ants.  Reed has clearly sought inspiration from Star Wars and James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy, but by abandoning seemingly everything that made the first two Ant-Man films so charming, Quantumania rings hollow. Nothing about the film feels organic, genuine or original.  Although we briefly visited the Quantum Realm in both Ant-Man films and in Ant-Man and the Wasp, Hank travelled there to retrieve Janet, who had been trapped there for 30 years. The Quantum Realm has always been presented to us as a hugely dangerous, abstract space that should be avoided at all costs and that no life could exist there.  In Quantumania, by making it a place where laws of physics seem to apply and where several different tribes live, it just feels pretty safe. In the first film, Hank warns Scott that if stuck there, one would just float and shrink endlessly. It turns out, one could just go to a bar for a cocktail and play some blackjack. Quantumania is clearly designed to set up bigger storylines in Phase V, but the cost of that is that Reed’s film lacks an identity or purpose of its own. Although emotional arcs are set up, they’re never followed through on. Visually, the film is messy and flat; the CGI is shockingly poor and the action looks muddled.  At least Quantumania has one of the best casts in a Marvel film. Rudd is reliably good as Scott, who seems to lack personality. Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas are both in fine form and clearly enjoying playing characters they rarely are given an opportunity to play.  Newton is a smart casting choice and we can only assume Cassie, who has her own superhero suit already, will be a huge part of the MCU in the future. Unfortunately, although the film bares her name, Lilly’s character of the Wasp doesn’t really get to do anything. This may or may not be related to her comments on vaccines but she feels like deadweight in a film where there’s already too much going on.  But it’s Jonathan Majors who leaves the biggest impression. Kang was first teased at the end of Loki season 1 and set up as a Thanos-like threat. While we didn’t find out much, there’s an even stronger feeling that you really need to have seen both Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness to really understand what’s happening here as Marvel gets even more ambitious with its mind-boggling narratives.  Majors crafts an intriguing, layered villain here. While it’s still not entirely clear what he wants, except to conquer everything, which is far too vague at this point, or what his powers are, Majors’ Kang is calm and calculated, but we see glimpses of his cruelty and ruthlessness.  Quantumania feels like a lacklustre way to begin Phase V. A film completely void of any personality or a sense of fun, this is far from Marvel at its best. We can only hope better things are coming.  ★★★★☆

"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL," ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA *** (124 minutes) M
Slipping straight into the middle tier of Marvel movies comes Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, a perfectly enjoyable, perfectly disposable post-content popcorn seller that proves how the ability to master inter-dimensional time travel provides no guarantee against a cameo from Bill Murray. In what is essentially an animated film where the cast performed most of their roles in front of blank green screens (to be filled in later with the usual swirls of high-end visual effects), we spend most of our time throughout this light-hearted excursion in a place called the Quantum Realm. Looking vaguely like a noir version of Avatar’s Pandora, the place is best described as a sub-atomic inner universe inhabited by all manner of organic life forms and civilizations all of which, despite living in such a bizarre alternate universe, still follow the laws of physics and the importance of good bar service. It is here where our heroes Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton ) and Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), along with her dad Hank (a beautifully groomed Michael Douglas) and mum Janet (the timelessly pulchritudinous Michelle Pfeiffer) find themselves after a mishap in the lab sucked them, along with a colony of super-intelligent ants, into the netherworld.  It’s a major bummer for Janet, too, having already spent 30 years there, during which she made a lot of friends, including Krylar (Murray), the affable leader of an advanced society with whom she developed an uncomfortably close friendship. And when the man orders a drink he knows what he wants.  A super villain called Kang (Jonathan Majors) is up to all sorts of mischief with the multiverse. This includes plans for the destruction of worlds, the murder of trillions, the eradication of complete timelines and various other annoying pursuits. Luckily, the combined abilities of our titular heroes, along with their relatives, are just the thing to stop Kang in his tracks, though the effort involves recruiting vast hordes of the realm’s inhabitants. To the delight of lovers of classic sci-fi films, these include an army of giant ants that, for all their glittering, super-advanced design and vvid rendering, look remarkably like the giant stars of the 1954 film Them!. No way that’s a coincidence. Presumably this is meant to invest the proceedings with some appreciable degree of father-daughter gravitas but, to be honest, it’s just another rudimentary element in a disposable, cartoony comic-book epic. It gives the narrative a decent spine, sure, but that’s chiefly to give the film’s impressive showcase of visual effects some context. Certainly, the film is a visual hoot, with some truly dazzling design work and several lovely VFX sequences, the best being a sequence in which Ant-Man is replicated thousands of times to form a human pyramid. Take that Agent Smith from Matrix Reloaded. The green-screen acting is good, with Majors making a convincing Kang and Paul Rudd’s cheeky air in the opening real-world reel setting the tone nicely for what is a fun, inconsequential ride through the Quantum Realm. Given the heaviness we got with Endgame and Infinity War – both terrific Marvel movies, to be sure – Quantumania is served up by director Peyton Reed with the same lightness of touch he gave the two previous Ant-Man films (2015 and 2018). It’s a good film to chew gum to. Not counting the lengthy end credits (with the screen-filling list of names of all the digital artists who toiled on the film) and the mandatory teaser clips about what is to come in the Ant-Man sub-franchise, the actual feature film itself runs a mere 112 minutes. That’s pretty lean for a franchise that has been assailing us with epics that are still busy regaling us with explosions and incomprehensible story points at the two-hour mark."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Delivers &#40;however disjointedly&#41; on &quot;B-lister in over his head&quot; cosmic adventure romp despite obvious post-Pandemic schedule-retooling into a big franchise place-setter&#59; buoyed by a scene-stealing heavy turn from Johnathan Majors
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE," That’s a phrase we hear during a break-up that’s supposed to make the pain go down a little easier. I’m not the same person when we met. My needs and wants have changed. You’re great, you haven’t done anything wrong. We’ve just grown apart. Things like that. Well, after Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, I’m thinking it might be time to have the Talk with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, at least for now. Who knows, maybe Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will feel like a marriage retreat that brings the spark back into our humdrum relationship. But right now, I’m eyeing the door, and trying to figure out who gets what in the house, and where I’m going to borrow the truck to haul my stuff out. But it’s just one bad movie, you may be thinking. It’s not worth tossing out fifteen years of love and understanding, right? Well, the bloom has been off the rose for a while now. Other than Spider-Man: No Way Home, most of Phase 4 was a bust. It had its moments, sure, and a couple of the television shows were fun, but none of the films ever reached the heights on the other Phases at their best. Granted, it’s hard to top Avengers: Endgame for sheer spectacle and scale, but there was a shared investment there, with character arcs that concluded satisfactorily and an emotional resolution that meant something. Maybe I’m not giving it enough time? Maybe, but it’s been almost 4 years since Endgame and there hasn’t been a single story thread except for Spider-Man’s that’s meant a whole lot. Instead, we get a lot of wheel spinning, some clever jokes, and promises of an interesting story that never quite gets fulfilled. Which brings me to Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, which has to be the most inert, lifeless film in the MCU yet. I wasn’t all enamored with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, but at least that movie had a voice and a spirit to it, Sam Raimi bringing his spook-a-blast horror sensibilities into the MCU and having a thorough blast kicking down proverbial ant hills to see if they fight. Peyton Reed (who I quite like as a director when he’s allowed to play – his Down With Love  is one of the most underrated, and sexy films of the 21st century) gives us nothing of his personality here. Quantumania feels like it’s made entirely by committee, with checkpoints instead of story arcs, and completely subservient to everything that’s come before, utterly afraid to forge its own path. This doesn’t feel like a movie that was written so much as index carded and pinned to a cork board. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is trying to make up for lost time with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who wasn’t Blipped away like half the world, and when Lang returned, five years had passed, and a good chunk of Cassie’s childhood. Cassie is rebelling, getting thrown in jail at protests, but she’s also spending a lot of time with Henry Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), trying to use the quantum technology to better humanity. When Cassie sends a mapping signal down into the Quantum Realm, something comes back, and soon the Langs and the Van Dynes are thrown deep into the microverse, stuck in the middle of a war between rebels and Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). Seems Janet knows Kang, and she knows that if Kang gets what he wants, trillions of lives throughout all the universes and timelines are in danger. There is so much green screen in this movie that I have no idea whether or not any of these actors actually spent any time outside. Granted, the Quantum Realm is visually impressive, a full on Jack Kirby-inspired universe, but we rarely get to spend any time exploring its facets because we’re thrust into a “Fetch the glowing orb” plot that is one long retrieval video game. Go here, talk to this person, and get this spaceship, to go to this building and meet this other person – you want to press X half the time to skip the cutscene. There is nothing real for these actors to anchor on to, so far too often we see glazed-over performances that we are expecting to deliver important plot points and emotional moments but there’s nothing tangible for the actors to react to. I’ve never seen Michael Douglas look more bored, or Bill Murray looking so vainly for the exit to get the hell out of this place. Michelle Pfeiffer fares a little better, but she’s given a past and a little something to do. Rudd and Lilly profess this great love for each other, but they hardly share any screen time together. Instead, Lang spends most of his time chasing after his daughter, who is in constant danger and has very little agency of her own. Without spoiling, there is one character who makes an appearance that should have been far more fun, but instead we get this really bad Nintendo 64 effect, coupled with a truly weird and off-putting performance from the actor. Perhaps it’s not the actor’s fault — the character gets some very clunky dialogue — but it’s practically Jar Jar Binks level humor. This is a franchise that gave us some remarkable effects work on characters like the Hulk and Thanos, but here it’s laughably bad. At some point, I feel like the Marvel suits showed Jonathan Majors what his story arc in Phase 5 and beyond entails, because he’s the only actor here that doesn’t feel rote or bland. I’m still not entirely sure what Kang’s motivation is (although I’m sure some Marvel comics fans could tell me, but having talked to a couple, even they told me that Kang’s story is… complicated, and not something easily explained in a movie), but Majors gives Kang an inner life that informs the character, even if we aren’t privy to a lot of it. We’re going to be seeing a lot more of Kang in the future — the next Avengers film is called The Kang Dynasty, and of course the Loki TV series will likely have more to say about him — but for now, he’s just the movie’s bad guy, and without understanding what drives him, Kang isn’t a very unique threat. You can tell Majors is having fun, though, and at times, that’s almost enough to move Quantumania forward. A little. Is Quantumania bad enough to make me want to quit the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe? Well… I’ll see Guardians, but mostly out of obligation and because I’m a big fan of Dave Bautista. Those characters still inspire a bit of joy in me. But there’s nothing Quantumania does that makes me want to stick around. There were moments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that I frankly thought I’d never see on a movie screen, and like many of you I let my inner child play with those movies. But we all have to grow up sometime, I suppose, and while Quantumania looks shiny and new, there isn’t much but a plastic veneer. You know, at the end of a relationship, we are the ones who grow out of it, and sometimes we see that our partner isn’t growing with us. So, Marvel Cinematic Universe, it pains me to say this, but… maybe it’s not me. Maybe it is you. Text me when you get your crap together, and we’ll grab a coffee. Until then, just leave the keys under the mat. Alan Cerny has been writing about film for more than 20 years for such sites as Ain’t It Cool News, CHUD, Birth Movies Death, and ComingSoon. He has been a member of the Houston Film Critics Society since 2011. STAR WARS biased. Steven Spielberg once called Alan a “very good writer,” and Alan has the signed letter to prove it, so it must be true."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE," A deep dive into the Quantum Realm, the subatomic secret universe beneath our own, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a glorious way to kick-start Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That’s not least because it fully unveils Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), the major new villain of the series who has already been earmarked to clash with the Avengers in a future film. But when Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), daughter of Ant-Man’s alter ego Scott, starts messing with Hank’s “ant science” tech, sending a signal to the Quantum Realm, they all get sucked back in. Directed by Peyton Reed, this new Ant-Man outing truly lives up to its title. The manic multi-coloured world makes it feel like you’ve just stepped in the Star Wars cantina, while weird and wonderful creatures fill the screen, from one with a broccoli stalk for a head to a blob that oozes goo that allows those who drink it to understand the bizarre alien language they speak. A destroyer of worlds, the time-bending Kang – or a variant thereof – has already been seen in Marvel TV show Loki, which first introduced the alternate dimensions known as the multiverse. But here Majors gets to flex his not inconsiderable muscles. With two scars down his face, he’s every bit the equal of Thanos, the monstrous foe the Avengers previously defeated. Imprisoned in the Quantum Realm, when Ant-Man and the others arrive he spies his chance to use them as a way out. Rudd also steps up here, bringing humour and heart to the story, although it’s really an ensemble – Hank, Hope, Janet, and Cassie all play their part in this hugely enjoyable knockabout adventure."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,&apos;Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania&apos; is certainly likable&#46; It has laughs&#44; astonishing visuals&#44; and a terrifying villain&#46; But it also has some little&#8230; bugs&#46; There are just a few niggling flaws that bite at you and refuse to let go&#46;
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL," Kudos to Marvel Studios for sticking by its heroes. When the MCU began over a decade ago, no one ever really expected the tiny titular hero Ant-Man would be given his own stand-alone film, let alone two of them. With Captain America and Iron Man now fading further in the distance and the first two Ant-Man movies earning a combined total of $1 billion at the worldwide box office, we’ve arrived at the third outing of nobody’s favourite Avenger. While there’s a kooky, psychedelic feel to Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania that brings on echoes of Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy, it falls under the weight of its own ambition and loses sight of what made its two predecessors so breezily enjoyable. Awash with a cacophony of relentless CGI and archetypal set pieces and damaged by mawkish dialogue and endless exposition, this is a textbook example of why going bigger is rarely better. Life is pretty great for Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) aka Ant-Man and the Wasp. After saving the world a couple of times now, Scott has settled into a quiet life promoting his new autobiography, “Look Out for the Little Guy” and enjoying the spoils of being a celebrity. Hope has taken control of the Pym van Dyne Foundation, which now uses the Pym Particles for humanitarian efforts. Her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) have settled back into married bliss after being reunited in the previous film, although Janet is still reluctant to discuss her 30 years trapped in the mysterious Quantum Realm. The only minor thorn in Scott’s side is his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who’s clearly inherited her father’s rebellious heroic streak and keeps getting arrested for sticking up for those left homeless after “the Blip.” But the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree in other ways with Cassie taking a keen interest in science and technology. Under the secret tutelage of Hank, she’s developed a device that can seemingly safely map the Quantum Realm without the need to venture into the volatile minuscule dimension. Naturally, everything goes pear-shaped the moment Cassie first turns on her device and the entire Lang/van Dyne family is immediately sucked (and trapped) inside the Quantum Realm. They soon discover this subatomic universe is ruled with an iron fist by Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), an exiled traveller with a mysterious history with Janet whose lust for power and knowledge of the multiverse could have severe ramifications for Earth if he ever escaped the Quantum Realm. One of the elements that made the first two Ant-Man films such a goofy guilty pleasure was the delicious ways the action sequences played with the scale of common objects. Sadly, that’s no longer present in this threequel as we enter the strange CGI-heavy world of the Quantum Realm barely ten minutes into the film and stay there for the next two hours. Sure, Scott and Hope still grow bigger and smaller throughout the proceedings, but it’s only ever for the sake of completing missions or dispatching a series of goons. It’s missing that contextualization and crucial concept of size that provided such levity and ingenuity. Instead, we’re plonked into a bizarre alien land that resembles Avatar‘s Pandora without the sweeping majesty and bright colours and inhabitants that look like leftovers from a Star Wars film. A gelatinous blob who’s obsessed with how many “holes” everyone else has. A giant mechanical floating head with baby arms and legs. Sentient buildings that can walk and fight during combat. Stingray-like creatures that double as transportation devices. A spaceship featuring two large worms that suck onto your arms for steering purposes. A creature with broccoli for a head. It’s all here and it’s all very, very weird. To its credit, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania embraces its oddity and silliness with full vigour. There’s a playful vibe that’s easy to dig and its entire visual aesthetic is unlike anything in the MCU thus far, and that has to count for something. But it’s drowning in so much muddy, sludgy CGI that it all just becomes far too much. It brings back all those awful memories of the George Lucas Star Wars prequel trilogy where you just wish someone had told him less can be more. It’s that timeless adage of just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should. It leaves our titular duo to become almost lost in a film that’s supposedly their own, particularly Hope who’s relegated to nothing more than a generic sidekick this time around. Rudd is typically charming and reliable, but even he and the usually-terrific Newton can’t bring to life screenwriter Jeff Loveless‘ forced attempts at a father-daughter narrative that just never really gets off the ground. Perhaps that’s one of the foibles of recasting Cassie. We’re asked to believe their tight bond within mere moments of meeting this new incarnation of someone we’ve only previously seen as a child and their lack of familial chemistry never really sells it effectively. Douglas takes a big back seat to Pfeiffer, who genuinely shines as always. As we delve into Janet’s past, we feel her crushing guilt over decisions made in the Quantum Realm that caused vast ramifications for those stuck living in this microscopic world. The plot inherently revolves around Janet’s connection to Kang and her valiant attempts to set everything right, gifting Pfeiffer the opportunity to completely steal this film as only she can. Her scenes with Majors are the film’s highlights in quieter conversational moments where it focuses on humanity and emotion rather than whatever the CGI wizards have cooked up in their computers. The sublime Majors makes a glorious entrance into the MCU that hints at larger things to come. His line delivery and overall presence are genuinely menacing and he’s rather enthralling to watch. Kang is a formidable foe and one that Majors instil with an equal measure of unsettling calmness and terrifying fury. Majors understands the assignment and eats it all up with gleeful joy. His performance is worth the price of admission alone. It’s just a shame almost everything else falls rather flat. The humour and sarcasm of the first two Ant-Man adventures are both practically non-existent here. It doesn’t help that a great levity-injecting supporting character like Michael Peña’s Luis is nowhere to be found. It often feels like this film exists as nothing more than an introduction for Kang with a generic Ant-Man story built around it. It doesn’t explore its existing characters or offer them anything new to do. It’s merely lazily laying the foundations for future chapters without standing on its own two feet and it’s a rather tepid way of kicking off Phase Five of the MCU."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE," Ant-Man has always been too small for the MCU. It’s his niche, his schtick, the reason his movies have small stakes and even smaller solutions. Previously, they offered a break as the MCU barreled towards its Thanos-driven endgame, but now Ant-Man is being asked to kick off Phase 5 of the wayward universe, a challenge he rises to meet. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania doesn’t put the MCU back on the rails so much as provide a mildly entertaining entry in an increasingly mild universe. The MCU had to pull back after Endgame, but Phase 4’s redirect was such a sputtering effort that it’s hard to know where in the multiverse it’s headed. Small scale character introductions hit charming high points (Shang-Chi) and lethargic low points (Eternals). Stylistic swings like Multiverse of Madness and Love and Thunder divided even the most ardent fans, and the increasing need to keep up with a multitude of television shows in addition to the handful of movies a year felt like a narrative burden that threatened to weigh the whole thing down.  What Quantumania does right is step away from the mess a bit, a fitting strategy for a character who has always been slightly removed from the action. You’ll be perfectly fine if you didn’t see its villain’s introduction in Loki. In fact, you can probably get away with knowing very little about Ant-Man or any of his cohorts. That’s because Quantumania doesn’t pull from the MCU nearly as much as it pulls from Star Wars, an inexplicable but admittedly much more appealing tack to this Star Wars die-hard. The influence becomes readily apparent when Ant-Man and his family/friends get sucked into the quantum realm. Instead of getting lost in a mind blowing world ruled by quantum mechanics, they find a battle ground between an evil emperor (technically Kang the Conqueror), his faceless army, and a ragtag rebellion. Our heroes fly to quirky bars, meet a variety of humanoid beings, and generally wallow in the aesthetics of every space western since cinema went to a galaxy far, far away. Oh, and the plot is literally about stopping the emperor from getting his fancy ship working. Disney might want to look into suing itself for copyright violation, although it’s unlikely anyone would remember Quantumania by the time money was exchanged. Like so many Star Wars riffs, the instant pleasures of beloved familiarity are fleeting, and nothing else about the film is strong enough to lift it out of oblivion. Visual spectacle was abandoned long ago by most of the MCU, which has a well-reported history of not giving VFX artists time to complete their work. Quantumania is one of the shoddier entries by even its low standards, setting Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Kathryn Newton (his daughter Cassie), and Evangeline Lilly (Wasp) adrift in a world far less convincing than an old fashioned matte painting would’ve provided. Outside of not looking like they’re in this world, the reason any of them are sucked into the battle between an empire and a rebellion is so nebulous it undercuts most of the film’s narrative drive. Michelle Pfeiffer’s Janet stalls moving the plot forward because she has to hide the info she has from her husband, Hank (Michael Douglas), and the rest of the group for…reasons (this isn’t avoiding spoilers; the movie never explains it). And just when there’s a spark of plot inspiration, careening off into a strange sequence involving a well-earned name-check of Schrödinger’s cat, the bizarreness is resolved by a completely nonsensical evocation of Ant-Man’s weak character motivation: he just wants to get his daughter home safe. Jonathan Majors’ Kang isn’t filled out any better. His mysterious introduction in Loki was one of the more memorable moments the MCU has generated in years, but they seemingly forgot to fill in the blanks of his backstory, abilities, and desires. Majors, like the rest of the cast, does an admirable job of conveying what this particular narrative needs to tick, which in a Star Wars riff is as simple as light side = good / dark side = bad, but he’s never as compelling or menacing as he was during his brief television appearance. And that’s what truly holds Quantumania back. It’s not the Star Wars influences, which aren’t remotely novel but are fun, nor is the trademark small scale of Ant-Man as detrimental since the MCU has drifted into smaller stakes. The issue is that it doesn’t push the MCU in a firm direction, which won’t motivate people to stay up to date on all the films and TV series it wants you to sink your time into.  On the flip side, though, that’s not really Quantumania’s job. It’s a tiny piece in a massive multiverse, and within the mess that has become, it’s a frivolous but entertaining entry. Those who mourn the MCU’s pre-Endgame narrative interwovenness will likely continue to be disenchanted. Those who mourn the MCU’s muscling out of a lone film’s dip into another world, though, will be better suited to enjoy Quantumania and all its unmoored, immediate pleasures."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE," Paul Rudd must really be as nice as he looks. He agreed to appear in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” despite a story that pushes him to the margins and a script that doesn’t play to his strengths. Forget all that. “Ant-Man: Quantumania” is a glum, tiresome exercise that follows the pattern of every run-of-the-mill superhero movie ever made. There’s a villain. He’s unconquerable. He’s going to destroy everything. But, somehow, after a lot of bright orange explosions that look like something on a computer screen ... well, you can guess the rest. The movie has two good performances (by Jonathan Majors and Michelle Pfeiffer) that are dramatic, but neither of them have anything to do with Rudd’s easy charm and flair for comedy. Rudd’s scenes are mostly played opposite Kathryn Newton, as Ant-Man’s teenage daughter, Cassie. In the movie’s opening minutes, Cassie almost gets the family killed by accidentally getting them dragged into the bubbling red Quantum Realm. Cassie is clearly an imbecile, but since it’s a rule of superhero movies, and of American movies in general, that teenagers can never be wrong, this is never acknowledged. Instead, most of Rudd’s performance consists of his looking at Newton lovingly and calling her “peanut,” while she, as Cassie, tells him off for no good reason.   ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"": Sci-fi adventure. Starring Paul Rudd, Kathryn Newton, Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors. Directed by Peyton Reed. (PG-13. 125 minutes.) In theaters Friday, Feb. 17. The real star of this movie is Pfeiffer — and that’s a wonderful thing to be able to say in 2023 — yet her stardom here comes tinged with frustration. This is one of the greatest and most colossally underrated screen actresses of our time, but there are no showcases being written for her talent. As Janet, she’s just a cog in this movie’s machine, a jewel in a pile of garbage. In an early scene, Cassie shows off a device she has invented that can send signals to the Quantum Realm. As Janet watches this young idiot, she tenses, and a look crosses Pfeiffer’s face, edgy, full of unspoken trauma. It’s a look we remember from much better movies: Something bad is going to happen, and there’s no way to stop it. Thanks to Cassie, “Quantumania” isn’t really shot in San Francisco, except for brief snippets. The rest takes place in a green-screen world, where beleaguered tribes are in a protracted and losing battle against a guy who calls himself Kang the Conqueror. A name like that should have been a red flag, but it turns out he is someone Janet knew back in the day. The flashback to Kang (Majors) and Janet’s past is the only living portion of the movie. Both are stuck in the Quantum Realm and want to get out, so they work together on an escape plan. What Janet only later discovers is that Kang, who seems nice enough, is actually a force of destruction who  exists outside time and wants to destroy planets and timelines. That’s sci-fi silliness, but Pfeiffer dignifies it with real human emotions. She doesn’t play the absurdity of “my friend wants to kill planets,” but rather “my best friend turns out to be evil, and I have to stop him.” And Majors dignifies it, too, finding a fascinating mental through line for Kang: He’s weary. He has seen everything, and he knows that nothing lasts and nothing matters.  But there’s only so much goodwill that a movie can buy with a well-acted 10-minute segment. Throw in a single comic interlude (a famous screen comedian as one of Janet’s ex-lovers), and you have 15 minutes of pleasure scattered over a 125-minute wasteland.  Here and there, screenwriter Jeff Loveness, remembering that he’s writing an “Ant-Man” movie, will throw in some half-hearted joke, but it doesn’t belong and only seems jarring. “Ant-Man” isn’t an example of bad comedy. It’s bad drama, bad science fiction, and a waste of everyone in it, including Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas (yes, he’s back, too). The case of Lilly is particularly odd, in that her character’s name is in the title but she does nothing in the movie but stand next to Rudd, while he’s also doing nothing. "
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL," El comienzo de la Fase 5. El comienzo del reinado de Kang el Conquistador. Y por supuesto, la continuación de todo lo que vino antes, desde “Ant-Man & The Wasp” hasta “Avengers Endgame”. “Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania” tenía bastante que hacer, y desgraciadamente, no lo hace todo bien. No me da gusto decirlo, pero esta es la primera película de Marvel Studios en perderme; en hacerme sentir no que estaba viendo algo divertido y ligero, si no más bien una suerte de preparación tediosa para lo que vendrá después, una historia simplona protagonizada, al menos, por un gran grupo de actores carismáticos. Espero que solo sea un bache en el camino, y no una representación del futuro de la MCU. Al comenzar la película, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, genial como siempre) es considerado como un héroe por prácticamente la población entera de San Francisco. Pero ahora ha decidido colgar la toalla. En vez de ayudar a los Vengadores, se ha dedicado a escribir un libro autobiográfico, y a cuidar a su familia. Lamentablemente, esto último no le ha funcionado tan bien —de hecho, en su afán por hacer una diferencia y ayudar a los demás, su hija Cassie (Kathryn Newton) acaba en la cárcel, siendo rescatada tanto por Scott como por Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). Felizmente, Cassie tiene también otros proyectos en mente. Junto a su abuelo, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), ha sido capaz de crear un aparato que puede mandar señales y traer información de vuelta del Reino Cuántico, lo cual no le hace mucha gracia a Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). Pero las cosas solo pueden empeorar. Luego de intentar usar la máquina, Scott y sus suegros, así como Hope y su hija, son todos transportados al Reino Cuántico, donde terminan separándose. Empeñados en encontrar a los demás, Scott y Cassie eventualmente se tendrán que enfrentar a Kang el Conquistador (un excelente Jonathan Majors), quien solo quiere salir del Reino Cuántico para… bueno, conquistar el mundo exterior en todas sus variantes y líneas temporales. Como se deben haber dado cuenta, “Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania” es mucho más ambiciosa y grande que sus predecesoras. Mientras que las dos primeras cintas de “Ant-Man” funcionaban muy bien como historias de escala relativamente pequeña, centradas en las relaciones entre personajes, y en objetivos muy concretos, lo que tenemos acá es un filme mucho más fantástico y de problemas enormes. Las peleas en cuartos con juguetes han sido reemplazadas por encuentros masivos en medio de un mundo dentro de un mundo. La miniaturización de San Francisco, ha sido reemplazada por el Reino Cuántico, un lugar donde el tiempo y el espacio funcionan de distinta manera, y donde todo parece estar hecho de imágenes digitales sobrediseñadas. Seguramente ya se han dado cuenta de que dichos cambios no me hicieron mucha gracia. Toda la personalidad, todo el encanto con el que contaban las películas de “Ant-Man” ha sido eliminado, reemplazado por una estética y un estilo que se asemeja demasiado a cualquiera otra película millonaria de superhéroes. Es decir, (casi) todo lo que diferenciaba a este personaje y su mundo de su competidores —o compañeros de Marvel—, ha sido sustituido por algo mucho más genérico. El sentido del humor no es el mismo —aunque debo admitir que un par de chistes sí me hicieron reír—, y la gracia de este mundo —reconrextualizar elementos cotidianos al verse desde una perspectiva enana, o agrandar dichos elementos para ser usados de diferente manera— simplemente no está. Olvídense del chupetín de Hello Kitty enorme de la segunda película. Teníamos suerte en aquella época, y no lo sabíamos. Lo cual es una pena, porque es precisamente por todo aquello que “Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania” se siente mucho menos imaginativa que sus dos predecesoras. Se supone que los personajes son enanos en el Reino Cuántico, pero como todo luce como una melcocha digital de color y criaturas amorfas, no hay una sensación de escala. No hay nada con qué comparar a los personajes, por lo que podrían ser de tamaño normal, y no habría mucha diferencia. Sí, Ant-man y The Wasp y eventualmente un personaje más crecen y se achican con frecuencia, pero solo para dar golpes o pisotear gente. No hay mucho más que eso. Es más —conté al menos cuatro instancias en las que los problemas de nuestros protagonistas sea hubiesen resuelto si es que Scott se hacía gigante, pero… simplemente no lo hacía. Porque si lo hacía, no podría haber película. Ugh. No quiero sonar como un viejo renegón que le está gritando a una nube, porque aunque no lo crean, siempre había disfrutado de las películas de Marvel Studios. Le encuentro elementos valiosos hasta a sus más decepcionantes producciones — “Thor: el mundo oscuro” tiene la batalla final con portales, por ejemplo; “Eternals” al menos intentó hacer algo distinto, y hasta “Thor: Amor y Trueno”, a pesar de ser una payasada, tenía un estilo propio. No creo poder decir lo mismo de “Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania”, desgraciadamente. No es una película terrible —el reparto es muy bueno, y algunos gags funcionan—, pero definitivamente me decepcionó más de lo que esperaba. Pero como ya decía, al menos los actores se están esforzando. Paul Rudd sigue siendo increíblemente encantador como Scott, esta vez interpretándolo como un padre que simplemente quiere que su hija tenga una vida normal. Kathryn Newton (“Detective Pikachu”) mezcla algo de rebeldía con valentía y gracia para interpretar a Cassie. Y por supuesto, actores de la talla de Michael Douglas y Michelle Pfeiffer brillan en sus respectivos roles (por más de que, por momentos, se les vea algo perdidos rodeados de tanta Pantalla Chroma). Pero es Jonathan Majors quien me pareció más intrigante. Este parece ser El Año de Majors (™); entre su impresionante e incómoda actuación en “Magazine Dreams”, su aparición acá como Kang, y por supuesto, su rol en “Creed III”, parece que el público por fin podrá darse cuenta de lo bueno que es. Y sí —es muy bueno en “Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania”, otorgándole mucha sutileza y humanidad a un papel potencialmente estereotípico. Pero curiosamente, el guion lo termina defraudando, haciendo que Kang se sienta como un villano megalomaníaco más, que es maléfico Porque Sí. Quiero seguir viendo al Kang de Majors solo por él, y porque espero que su caracterización vaya a mejorar en películas futuras. No obstante, ni siquiera el excelente reparto pudo evitar que “Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania” se sienta como una oportunidad desperdiciada. Fuera de todo lo ya mencionado, también me fastidió el “world-building” (construcción del mundo), o mejor dicho, la falta de uno. Los ambientes en el Reino Cuántico se sienten vacíos, inertes, muy separados en sus planos abiertos o aéreos de lo que vemos con los actores a nivel de piso. Hay ciudades enteras que no parecen estar muy pobladas, y nunca nos enteramos de quienes son los secuaces de Kang (unos solados con cabezas de pecera). Y aunque hay muchísimos efectos visuales (lo siento mucho por los artistas de VFX, en serio), la mayor parte del tiempo, tenemos a los actores en sets con pisos de metal o tierra, con todo lo interesante (y colorido y amorfo) en el fondo. No se siente táctil. Sé que jamás iba a estar al nivel de “Avatar: el camino del agua”, pero tampoco tenía que irse al otro extremo. En fin. Si me quejo tanto, es porque, lo crean o no, vi “Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania” desde la perspectiva de un fan. Desde la perspectiva de alguien que ha estado siguiendo al MCU desde sus inicios, y que hoy en día sigue viendo todas las películas en el cine, y todas las series en Disney Plus. Pero como dije líneas arriba: esta es el primer filme que me ha perdido. La primera donde me sentí desconectado, como si estuviese viendo algo que seguramente muchos disfrutarán, pero que yo…. no. “Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania” es una película bien actuada y con algunos elementos que funcionan, pero que en general, no termina de cuajar; y que al tratar de hacer mucho, pierde todo el encanto tan presente en sus dos predecesoras. Nuevamente: espero que esto solo sea un bache en el camino. Estaré cruzando los dedos.

"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE," That's exactly what we get from Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the kick-off of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase Five and the film that thrusts the menacing and monstrous Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) into this latest journey into the franchise's multiverse.  Amidst all of the excitement, energy, and action that we've come to expect from the MCU, Quantumania serves up an abundance of the kind of heart that is all too rare in a franchise more defined by three-hour epic adventures and eye-popping visual effects than anything resembling a richness of humanity. While the story here, penned by first-time feature writer Jeff Loveness (Rick & Morty, Jimmy Kimmel), is slight enough so as to barely be relevant, Quantumania exceeds expectations precisely because it is content to tell a simple, meaningful story and to not overstay its welcome.  Paul Rudd is back, of course, as Ant-Man. He's settled into life as Scott Lang, a beloved San Francisco resident a few years removed from his world-saving ways and now more concerned with cheery readings of his memoir Look Out for the Little Guy and making up for the time he missed with his now teenaged daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton, Blockers). His longtime philanthropic girlfriend Hope (Evangeline Lilly), aka The Wasp, is still here and even Hope's parents, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank (Michael Douglas) seem to have settled into something resembling domestic bliss.  Cassie has become increasingly disenchanted with her father, frustrated that the one-time worldchanger is now seemingly unconcerned with the world around him. Herself having acquired the family's genius genes, she secretly works with alongside Hank to explore the long mysterious Quantum Realm that built Hank's career and left Janet traumatized by the realm. When it's eventually revealed that Hank and Cassie have been building a portal of sorts to the Quantum Realm in the family basement, the stage is set for that rare Marvel action adventure that resonates as much emotionally as it does visually.  By the time Kang the Conqueror enters the equation here, I was already fully invested in this delightful spectacle of chaos and community. From the film's opening moments, I found myself completely enamored by the humorous and heartfelt father-daughter relationship between Scott and Cassie that radiates a badass sincerity that feels both honest and surprisingly vulnerable. I was invested, as well, in the relationship between Hank and Janet, a relationship that feels one-note in dialogue yet comes magnificently to life in the hands of two such great actors as Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer. They both possess sublime comic timing and the ability to humanize their characters no matter how much lunacy surrounds them.  It's Evangeline Lilly's Hope that suffers a bit here as she's given very little to do other than to react off of those around her. While Lilly does this quite well, it's noticeably less interesting than the majority of the ensemble.  To tell you anything about the story itself would be unjust and certainly won't happen here. While we've met Kang the Conqueror briefly before, Quantumania puts the empathetic baddie front-and-center in a way that makes it clear that we're going to be seeing him again and again and again. While some might say that Jonathan Majors leans a bit too heavily into melodrama, for my money he's absolutely electrifying here with a performance that draws you in, gains your sympathy, then demands your submission. While Majors' performance is large, it's remarkably disciplined and immensely fun to watch.  While I wasn't quite sold on his character's design, Corey Stoll manages to impress as Darren/MODOK, a sort of homicidal Humpty Dumpty who harbors a little more than a grudge against Lang/Ant-Man. Bill Murray is here, as well, as Lord Krylar in a performance that would have likely come off as typical Murray even just a few months ago but in light of recent revelations borders on creepy. In terms of vocal work, David Dastmalchian creates a memorable new character out of Veb and I challenge you to not fall in love with him.  The original score from Christophe Beck features the usual Marvel bombast with episodic sensitivity, intimacy, and lunacy woven into its tapestry. Bill Pope's lensing is, as one would expect, inventive and far more energized that the first two Ant-Man films. More visually boisterous than its Ant-Man predecessors, Quantumania manages to immerse us in the Quantum Realm without compromising the film's heart and humanity.  The Ant-Man films have always been quieter endeavors and the same is true with Quantumania, a film that runs a Marvel slight 125-minutes and a film that exists somewhere in the universe between the 1977 Star Wars, a Guardians of the Galaxy flick, and something all its own.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania doesn't so much start off the MCU's Phase Five with a bang as it does with A tapestry of goofiness and gravitas. Quantumania may not be everything I wanted it to be, but from beginning to end this was a film that touched my heart, made me laugh, and dazzled my senses. "
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE," Ironic that, after all the millions of dollars spent on computer generated pizzaz, the best special effects come from two of the real life stars, serving up some real life acting. Paul Rudd and team are back, in what began as a good natured addition to the Marvel catalogue. When it first started, Ant-Man was breezy and fun, a good stretch for the franchise to reach the more traditional family friendly crowd. This chapter, which feels somewhat like a place holder, introduces us to a new bad guy, Kang the Conquerer, who Janet met decades ago and, not knowing what a bad guy he was, saved his life. Now, after an experiment gone wrong, Scott and his family wind up in the Quantum Realm, trying to set things right and, of course, get home. They bump into all sorts of characters, some of whom are more developed than others, all of whom are terrified of said Kang. Rightfully so, we find out. What is set up as the expected can-the-little-guy-save-the-day storyline takes a back seat to the ongoing set effects and myriad creatures. But none of it can compete with the eternally dazzling Michelle Pfeiffer (here proving a thing or two about fierce women of any age) and a downright glorious Jonathan Majors, who brings every bit of his superb theatrical training to what could be just another new enemy. The scariest moments are not from the seething serpents, fiery explosions or the usual will-they-or-won’t-they-live scenes. They’re when Majors talks. Quietly. Commanding our attention. And sending chills down our spines. It has been announced that Majors will star, as Kang, in two more Avengers movies and yes, you’ll want to stay for the post credit scenes to get a taste of what’s to come. If this ho-hummer serves as a vehicle to get us to those, I guess that’s not a bad thing. I actually laughed out loud though when Kang mutters something about not being able to tell one superhero from another. Maybe if each of the movies about them tried to work as stand alones, not just chapters in what seems to be an endless saga, he and I might feel differently."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania starts Phase 5 off with a flop as a dull story and questionable execution causes the film to be a wildly worthless miss&#46; 
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE," It has been a few months since Wakanda Forever was released, and so here we are again: another season, another “phase”, and another Marvel Studios feature. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the third in Marvel’s Ant-Man series, which to date has been an amiable albeit low-key franchise of action comedies starring Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, and Michelle Pfieffer. This third iteration quite is a surprise, as it abandons the more grounded nature of the earlier films in favour of an eye-popping planetary romance. Honestly, before the trailers starting running last year, I did not see this turn coming – and I like what I see. All due credit to director Peyton Reed, who pivots the style of the Ant-Man saga without breaking a sweat. Quantumania begins with Scott Lang (Rudd) enjoying an effective retirement from his Ant-Man persona. Girlfriend Hope Van Dyne (Lilly) is busy running an advanced tech company, and Scott is spending his time reconnecting with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) and promoting his self-aggrandising autobiography. Disaster strikes: Cassie’s scientific project, a device that can interact with the mysterious Quantum Realm, backfires and drags the entire family – Scott, Cassie, Hope, Hank (Douglas), and Janet (Pfieffer) – inside. This is a markedly different sort of science fiction to the first two Ant-Man features, and indeed to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in general. Quantumania introduces a hugely imaginative alternate world, packed with unusual landscapes, dizzying vistas, and bizarre alien creatures. It is the sort of environment that is a gift to conceptual designers, as well as to audiences. Every scene brings its own weird imagery: there is a character who doubles as a drinkable liquid, a house that is an angry gun-toting revolutionary, and some with broccoli for a head. It is all so strange that when actor Bill Murray turns up as a community leader he is barely worth a second glance. He simply fits in. There is a clear Taika Waititi influence on the film – more Ragnarok than Love & Thunder thankfully – as well as James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy, which paved the way here via talking raccoons and walking trees. The film is overrun with computer-generated- well, everything really, but once you adjust to its aesthetic it is all rather wonderful to watch. If anything there is simply too much of it. One of the perennial faults of the MCU is that each individual feature simply feels too long, and that is certainly an issue here. Much of that unnecessary time is spent on an over-long climax and denouement, and the bulk of the latter is spent foreshadowing the entirety of the MCU Phases 5 and 6. It is quite nice to see all of the franchise-building packed into a smaller section. The disastrous Age of Ultron was largely ruined by constant reminders of upcoming sequels; here, as long as you ignore the portentous advertising, you can almost enjoy Quantumania as its own self-contained adventure. There is good character work for each major character. Cassie gets a proper story for the first time, while Scott finds himself as a personal crossroads in terms of his future as an active superhero. As a scientist Hank gets to have a whale of a time, while Janet is revealed to have a whole new action-focused side to her personality. New supporting characters played by the likes of William Jackson Harper and Katy O’Brian are delightful. The film, however, is all-but-stolen by Jonathan Majors as new villain Kang the Conqueror. Audiences have seen a variation of the character already, if they watched Disney+ serial Loki back in 2021. This ‘proper’ incarnation, however, is outstanding. Powerful, eloquent, and beautifully portrayed, he is the sort of muscular (in every sense) antagonist that Ant-Man has been lacking in previous films. He works brilliantly within the confines of Quantumania, but it is also clear that he will be returning to plague Scott and the Avengers in films to come. The recently completed ‘phase four’ of the MCU (Black Widow to Wakanda Forever) felt like a let-down. Thanks to Kang, Quantumania kicks everything into high gear again. You would have thought Disney would run a mile from making a planetary romance feature, given that 2012’s John Carter – their high profile adaptation of A Princess of Mars.- lost the studio an estimated $200 million, and their more recent animated film Strange World lost another $100 million. I am happy they have, of course, since I love the genre and this is a really impressive attempt at it. What is particularly odd, however, is how this particular science fiction escapade has been plotted: characters being thrown by a technological device into an unfamiliar world, aided by a hero who spent decades trapped inside the alien landscape, where everything is ruled by a despotic duplicate of someone else with plans to invade the real world above? All it needs is a Daft Punk soundtrack and this would be a remake of Disney’s own Tron Legacy. I cannot lie, I vastly prefer the Tron version. That said, this is a winning progression for Ant-Man and a wonderfully enjoyable blockbuster. Phase 5 is off to an exciting start."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Buried deep deep deep down in Quantumania is the heart of what a good Ant-Man movie could be&#44; but it doesn&apos;t find it too often&#46; 
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE," For all their faults, Peyton Reed’s Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp felt at the time of their respective releases like welcome reprieves from the bombastic, CGI-laden spectacles of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Next to Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America, Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang, a.k.a. Ant-Man, brings an everyman quality to the MCU that makes the typically snarky humor of the first two Ant-Man films go down that much easier. The goofy little adventures that Ant-Man gets himself into in those films aren’t dependent on intertextuality with a dozen other films, allowing their visual playfulness—namely in regard to the shrinking and blowing up of objects—to be enjoyable for its own sake. But with Reed’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, it’s as if the suits at Marvel wondered what would happen if they not only made the film the flagship entry of yet another “phase” in the MCU, but ditched nearly everything that was remotely unique about the first two Ant-Man films. Within minutes of the film’s opening scene, Scott (Paul), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Hank (Michael Douglass), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Scott’s daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), are sucked into the Quantum Realm thanks to the unintended consequences of the latter’s new invention. Almost the entirety of Quantumania takes place in this strange, minuscule universe. As such, all the fun and amusing toying with scale that occurs throughout the first two films is pushed to the side in favor of a visually dull and murky world filled with floating flotsam and overly busy yet totally inert CGI backdrops that look more like decades-old screensavers than a meticulously designed and constructed space that we’ve never seen before. Indeed, the Quantum Realm feels like it was built from the spare parts of the Multiverse, Asgard, and the living planet from James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, with clear echoes of various Star Wars films thrown in for good measure. For all the wonder that the film’s characters express throughout their time there, the Quantum Realm is as lifeless and joyless as your average MCU setting. The filmmakers are clearly aiming to set a far more ominous tone with Quantumania, but the overabundance of unconvincing green screen only makes one wish that the characters would return to Earth for more fleet-footed action. In comparison to its breezy predecessors, Quantumania is laborious and self-serious to a fault. Sure, the filmmakers throw in what amounts to an extended cameo for Bill Murray as Lord Krylar, and Gregg Turkington’s return as Scott’s former Baskin Robbins manager is a diverting enough reminder that the Ant-Man films have featured both stars of On Cinema at the Cinema. But even these stabs at humor can’t shake the sense that Quantumania is just planting the seeds for a narrative that’s pushing toward epic consequences to come, and makes it that much more similar to so many other entries in the MCU centered around the Avengers. A large part of that stems from the film’s villain, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), and his particularly formidable powers and designs on destroying entire timelines in the metaverse—something that he’d already done before being banished to the Quantum Realm. Majors is reliably magnetic whenever he’s on screen, and here he conveys an emotional depth and inner torture that far exceeds what Jeff Loveness’s script gives him to work with. All his efforts certainly make him compelling to watch, but Kang’s motivations and background are so vague that his unflappable fury and personal drive are completely unmoored, leaving him as just another generic baddie set on destroying worlds on the Avengers’ watch. It’s clear that Quantumania is setting Kang up as the new Thanos, a uniquely powerful and evil villain who will require an expanded team of superheroes to defeat. Yet in saving his backstory and, well, endgame for future stories only serves to make this particular film ring that much more hollow—another prologue for Marvel films to come. In reimagining the quirkier, more grounded, and less narratively congested spirit of the first two Ant-Man films into another battle to save all of humanity—and in countless timelines no less—Quantumania feels less the start of a new phase of Marvel films than a tired retread of adventures we’ve already been on. The reason the CGI is so much worse in this one, and the reason it is so dark and colorless, is because Disney used The Volume to shoot major segments of this movie. That’s the same technology that has turned Star Wars from the most visually stunning franchise on the planet into the grey-brown goop eyesore we have now on Disney+.  The technology is one-hundred-percent NOT READY yet, and may never be due to the fact you will never get the same clarity recording a TV screen with CGI rendered on it as you will rendering the CGI directly into the image. The only reason Disney is using it is to make movies faster and cheaper. Whenever you see The Volume being used, you immediately know, “They are purposefully sacrificing the quality of this movie/series in order to save time and money. They do not care about this movie/series at all.” It is not worth paying to see any movie or series that uses The Volume. You are guaranteed an ugly, dreary and dark viewing experience. Yes, The Mandalorian uses it but that series is saved, to the extent it is saved, by other elements, as well as some nice pure CGI shots in outer space. If you actually pay attention to many of the environments and backgrounds, they are just as ugly in that series as they are in Kenobi and Wakanda Forever and the House of the Dragon shots where they used it.  My recommendation: Do not support any movies or series that use The Volume. It is a blight on modern cinema. Send Disney a message loud and clear that we still want quality movies, with nice locations and visuals. Even nice CGI is much better than The Volume. Despite the bad CGI, something the MCU has been occasionally guilty of for years, I still liked this movie. I don’t think it was as good as the first Ant-Man movie. But I believe it was better than the second one. Unlike “Ant-Man & the Wasp”, it wasn’t marred by a weak villain and a badly written subplot regarding the Sokovia Accords, one of the MCU’s biggest mistakes."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE," Michael Peña's absence should have been a warning. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has grown so massive and all-consuming that it's not enough for an Ant-Man movie to be an Ant-Man movie. There must be a flood of new characters, who are flimsy excuses for merchandise. There must be elaborate retcons to urge viewers to rewatch the movies and shows that have come before. Also required are celebrity cameos for cheap thrills and head-scratching world-building to lay the groundwork for the latest MCU phase. In all of this, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a chaotic, woefully unfunny mess that has forgotten why its hero was such fun.  Master thief turned Avenger, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), is living it up in San Francisco, where he's a local celebrity who gets high-fives and selfie requests between book signings for his self-aggrandizing autobiography. He's reconnected with his teen daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) and his romance with superheroine/philanthropist Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) is going strong. He's even tight with her scientist/retired-superhero parents, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). But the lot of them are pitched into peril when Cassie's new invention gets them sucked into the Quantum Realm. Sure, Janet spent 30 years there. But in that time she made more enemies than friends. Specifically, she earned the ire of Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors), who is deadset on breaking his way out of this tinyverse and into the wider world, which he aims to conquer. (Duh.) While combatting resident foes, reconnecting with old frenemies, making new allies, and spouting loads of Phase Five exposition, this family will try to buzz their way back to San Fran while not dooming the Quantum Realm to the continued tyranny of Kang.  Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp director Peyton Reed returns to the helm for the third entry in this branch of the MCU. And he seems utterly at a loss to the demands of the Marvel machine in this one. Scott's lost his funny friends. (Peña's energy is sorely missed, and all the tedious recap dialogue could have been fun with him in driver's seat.) And as much of the movie is Scott racing around to protect Cassie from the small bad world, he's more often stressed than quipping. In fact, the funniest line in the movie goes to one of his enemies! So, Paul Rudd's ageless mug is left to oscillate between goofy grin and furrowed brow. Also wasted is Evangeline Lilly, whose Wasp has been downgraded from lead character to plot device. She pops up for save-the-day action moments. But it's easy to imagine a movie where Hope was at a conference while her family went on this adventure without her. Turns out the Wasp in the title actually refers to Pfeiffer's OG version.  Flustered and fatherly, Scott is relegated to a sidekick in his own movie, while Janet is an unquestionable badass. She can slip into foreign languages, a treacherous Star Wars cantina ripoff, and showdowns with the big bad with equal elegance and radiant sex appeal. If you love her in Batman Returns, (and you should) you'll likely relish her return to kick-butt dynamo. But this superhero sequel — which also boots its eponymous male hero to the story's fringe — isn't anywhere near as weird or thrilling as Tim Burton's classic.  Part of the problem is that while Jeff Loveness' script introduces an intriguing gang of new characters — most of them rebel freedom fighters opposing Kang — he gives them no arcs, and virtually nothing to do but be introduced. Their designs are varied and intriguing. Katy M. O'Brian is promising as she storms onscreen, a warrior princess with no patience for Scott's dithering. There's a goo guy, who is briefly amusing, a man with fire for a face, and The Good Place's William Jackson Harper as a comically annoyed telepath. (""Everyone is disgusting!"") But in a crowded field of curious Quantum Realm creatures and characters, these potentially enthralling sidekicks are little more than added flare, briefly sparkling, then forgotten.  Amid all this mess, only Pfieffer rises above, giving a performance that is grounded and moving. The rest of the cast — no matter how earnest — feels lost amid the onslaught of eyesore CGI. The Quantum Realm is a place of endless possibilities. But what Reed settled on seems to be a mash-up of Star Wars, Strange World, slime, and those Magic Eye posters that made us squint to make sense of them. That's actually kind of fitting. The CGI settings created for Ant-Man 3 are what a migraine might look like if it were a landscape, full of fleshy pink bits, punctuated either by glossy goop or crusty yellows. But moreover, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's action sequences are visually incoherent disasters.  Blur effects are added throughout, perhaps to suggest speed, or cover up a violent blow, or mask some of rough edges in the CGI. Whatever the reason, the result is the same: blurry sequences that undercut the suspense of the action. Making matters worse, the lighting scheme in the Quantum Realm seems straight out of the Battle of Winterfell, bestowing audiences with scenes so dark — even in IMAX — that it's difficult to make out what is happening beneath the charging orchestral score. Yet when the lights are turned up, you might wish they weren't.  As Reed has teased in pre-release interviews (and as is crystal clear on the movie's IMDb page), M.O.D.O.K. (aka Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing) has come to the MCU in live-action. And what they've done to make the character close to his comic depictions is an actual crime against Corey Stoll's face. To Stoll's credit, he brings much-needed verve and humor to this overstuffed family drama, getting the biggest laughs — even with abysmal dialogue. However, Reed's biggest visual joke in the movie is M.O.D.O.K.'s design, which is a twisted mix of metal, shiny flesh, and goop. It is funny, but it's also distractingly repulsive.  It's confounding how the MCU has taken one of the most buzzed-about rising stars (Jonathan Majors) and made his big-screen debut a role that is suffocatingly stiff. This Kang (as opposed to the one in Loki) wears a ludicrous costume (I don't care if that's what it looked like in the comics), and yet has no sense of humor or whimsy.  This Kang is a stoic warlord who sure loves conquering, and will tell you that a lot, while everyone else tells you how invincible he is. The evidence of this is that Kang's powers (based in SUPER advanced tech) are basically whatever is convenient for the script. He shoots out blue stuff that can kill people or zap superpowers or do whatever else I couldn't make out past the blurs and darkness. While this might be intended to make him seem impossible to beat, it's actually more annoying because there's no ground to grip as we're plunged into another battle of timelord nonsense versus the Ant family.  The other major issue with Kang is that following his storyline feels like work. Despite the profuse amount of recaps and exposition dumps that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania peppers throughout its plot, the movie is frustrating to follow because it demands so much prior knowledge and previous buy-ins for its characters. It's not enough to see all the Ant-Man movies, or all the Avengers movies. You better have watched Loki too! And not only that, you better remember all the fine points of that finale, or else Kang's blather falls flat.  The MCU movies used to be fun. Whether you knew the comics or not, they used to be thrilling adventures, thoughtfully laced with humor, eye-popping action, and hard-hitting character moments. But with its 31st entry, you can no longer blithely dive in for a good time. There'll be superficial recaps of plot points, sure. But Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has so little interest in its heroes, sidekicks, and villains that if you didn't pre-game with the previous movies — the better movies — then this one doesn't add up to the sum of its parts. There's no shame in being a popcorn movie. It's a shame Reed and company forgot that.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has big stars, quirky cameos, action sequences, world-building, and even — on rare occasions — punchlines. But it's barely a movie, pulling threads together for a grander scheme of merchandizing and cross-promotion over character-based storytelling. In the end, with its clumsy collision of influences, star power, CGI that is often rubbery or outright ugly, and a convoluted plot that should have an Excedrin tie-in, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is like a child's mixed media project, made of paper mache, glitter, and hunks of rotting ground meat.  Kristy Puchko is the Film Editor at Mashable.

"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL," Time sneaks up on all of us. Just 8 years ago, Paul Rudd made his debut in the MCU. The comedian found time to balance his already busy schedule and deliver stellar performances in various projects. This weekend sees Rudd’s fifth appearance as Scott Lang, a man troubled about the time he lost during the blip. Rudd does his best to shoulder the launch of Phase 5. However, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania delivers questionable story beats and world-building that leave the audience wanting more.  Scott Lang (Rudd) finally gets the respect he deserves. In addition to being recognized on the street as an Avenger, his memoir has become a hit. His relationship with Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) remains strong with date nights in San Fransisco. He enjoys family dinners with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), even after picking her up from jail. One day while eating dinner with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), Cassie reveals she’s been working on Quantum Realm technology. Janet yells to unplug the machine, sending a signal to the other world. However, it’s too late: a mysterious force pulls the family into the subatomic world. Below, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) awaits.  The poor pacing in the scene is hurt by a need to jump between storylines, which becomes a theme throughout Ant-Man‘s latest adventure. Quantumania wants to transport us to a world as inventive as the ones in the Guardians films. However, without Gunn’s oddball and compelling characters, we are left with weirdly contrived bits.  The two new characters that seem to escape this fate are William Jackson Harper‘s Quaz and Katy M. O’Brian‘s Jentorra. The return of Corey Stoll as Darrin/M.O.D.O.K. will potentially draw ire from some fans. It’s a performance and character that will certainly have its fans but will likely see just as many detractors. In many ways, he’s the face of the “contrived bits” issue. On one hand, it’s nice that Marvel acknowledges just how weird the world has become. On the other hand, the lack of seriousness can be offputting. Characters undermine their own perspectives, creating an issue where characters begin to beat themselves with self-deprecating humor during high-stakes situations.  After his brief moment in Loki, Jonathan Majors makes a genuine arrival that will shake the MCU to its core. He brings equal parts terrifying strength and unyielding charisma to draw us into his journey. He openly discusses the multiverse and the fights that are on the horizon for the Avengers. Majors wields omnipotence like a weapon. His performance here makes Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania a must-watch. It also makes the issues with the comic book film feel even more apparent. The craft side of Ant-Man also hurts the film considerably. For all the cool things it wants to show you, we are once again met with questionable CGI. This world is so overpopulated with visual effects we have very little perspective on what makes Ant-Man a special character. In prior fights, we’ve seen Scott rise to the size of skyscrapers. We’ve seen him shrink to fight next to a train set. These moments felt incredible, but in the Quantum Realm, we essentially drop the size antics in favor of track laying for the future MCU. This is the kind of film that undermines the idea of the MCU consisting of different franchises combining only in big moments. The visual style alone kills the idea of the small-time caper comedies that made the first two Ant-Man films stand out. "
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," There are sights in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania‘s sub-atomic Quantum Realm that equal anything on James Cameron’s Pandora. From the slug-like livestock cultivated by micro-humans to great fungal forests and beings of pure liquid, it’s a fantasia sprung straight from the imaginative covers of old sci-fi novels, with a visual imagination unparalleled by anything in the MCU thus far. And ironically, given that Ant-Man is typically seen as a comedy sub-franchise, Quantumania takes these alien realms much more seriously than the Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor.  Aside from the gloriously wacky absurdity of M.O.D.O.K. (more on him in a moment), this is a world full of jeopardy and relativity few laughs at its own expense. If only it had a better story to tell. Director Peyton Reed manages to conceal the story’s predictability for a while simply by keeping his lead characters in the dark for as long as he can. Once that’s over, however, it becomes a relatively straightforward tyrant vs. rebels narrative, with very little in the story that surprises, even as the visuals often do. Some brief setup in San Francisco establishes that Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is happy to rest on his heroic laurels after saving the world. His daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), thinks Scott is a bit of a sellout. She fights the power against police brutality, winding up in jail a time or two after misusing the science tools of her surrogate grandfather, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). When she tries to use her science to map the Quantum Realm, the whole family gets sucked in, with Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) issuing cryptic warnings about threats down there she never talked about before. They all involve Kang (Jonathan Majors), another individual who was trapped down there for very different reasons.  Marvel movies usually stand alone pretty well, but it really would help to watch the final episode of Loki season 1 to get a heads-up here. Majors has talked a lot about his character in interviews, but the movie itself doesn’t tell us much. He plays him as a man holding back lots of secrets and rage, but it’s apparent that Majors knows way more than the audience ever does. Or will for several more movies. A frequent complain made online about the Avatar movies goes something like this: “Well, they look really great, but the story’s predictable and bad.” Quantumania may make viewers appreciate just how well James Cameron does marry story to spectacle, because there’s so much less to relate to here. Newton makes a good teen Cassie, and shows the kind of infectious enthusiasm for heroics that’s becoming common to the younger superhero girls of the MCU. But because Cassie has been recast so many times, there’s no automatic emotional baggage in her scenes with Scott.  Pfeiffer and Douglas work well as an old married couple, but the movie could have done a lot more with, for example, the fact that Hank Pym usually creates his own enemies through his character flaws, and this time gets to do better. The only major conflict with palpable stakes is preventing Kang from hurting Cassie in order to force Scott to do his bidding. It’s not quite as relatable as some of the familial issues in the prior two films. Especially since Kang’s villainy is something we’re supposed to take on faith. His misdeeds have mostly taken place off-screen. And Cassie never truly feels endangered.  The trailers and star interviews to date suggested Kang would have a particular advantage over Scott. That he could tangibly offer him the chance to go back in time and get all the years with Cassie growing up that he missed. If this was ever in the film, it’s unfortunately been cut, except in mild inference. He makes an offer like that to Janet, regarding her missing Hope’s childhood years, but with Scott, he’s all threats. And he should be smart enough to figure out that Scott doesn’t do well with those. Throwing a nicely anarchic wrench into the works, however, is M.O.D.O.K., presented as a homicidal, childlike, cyborg Humpty Dumpty who looks as he should underneath all the augmentations. If you haven’t followed the discourse about which actor is semi-surprisingly playing the role, there are no spoilers here. Regardless, it’s a solidly entertaining take, even as the character’s MCU origins prove drastically different from the comics. He’s ridiculous, charismatic, and leaves audiences wanting more. Bill Murray’s role as Krylar, meanwhile, amounts to one extended scene. After the many dark and out-of-focus effects shots in Wakanda Forever, Quantumania feels like a feast for the eyes. If it were a meal, it would have magnificent plating and the fanciest sauce, but cut into it, and deep down it’s just a Big Mac underneath. There’s nothing terrible about that — Big Macs are tasty, predictable, and shouldn’t disappoint because you know exactly what you’re getting. Only when the presentation is so magnificent that you forget the  lowered expectations, will there be a letdown.  Marvel Studios’ big advantage over the competition used to be the care they took to match a solid story with the big special effects.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," The latest Marvel movie extravaganza cleverly disguises itself as a continuation of the Ant-Man saga, rather than an introduction to the so-called Phase V of the so-called Marvel Cinematic Universe. It features a slew of talented actors doing their very best to treat the extremely silly movie as though it were Serious And Actually Meant Something.  The first few minutes are perfectly fine, as Scott Lang, the tiniest Avenger of them all, jauntily walks the streets of San Francisco, timed to the rhythm of the Bee Gees’ “Stayin’ Alive,” as though it were the opening sequence for an updated, comic West Coast version of Saturday Night Fever (1977), only starring Paul Rudd rather than John Travolta. Instead, though, we hear “Welcome Back, Kotter,” which prompts comparisons to the sitcom, debuting in 1975, that served as a breakout role for … John Travolta.  The family is trapped there for centuries, aka Nearly The Movie’s Entire Running Time, where they perform magnificently under pressure and extreme stress, and also crack jokes, when time permits. They encounter Kang (Jonathan Majors), aka The Next Big Bad Villain Who Is Even More Evil And Powerful Than The Last Guy Who Destroyed The Universe. We don’t know why he’s so evil, except that Marvel needed a new villainous character to build their movies around. Also Jonathan Majors is a fierce presence, able to leap tall mountains in a single bound and also Do Anything He Wants To Do Before He’s A Marvel Supervillain.  Really, the movie is divorced from reality, logic, and common sense, but I’m sure that everyone involved tried very, very hard to make a movie that everyone would want to see in movie theaters. Occasionally, the combined star power manages to pierce the animated atmosphere by wisecracking or evincing genuine humanity. And the story revolves around the importance of a strong family unit, which isn’t a bad thing at all in fighting off evil villains from another realm, if your entire family is superpowered.  Moments of joy are few and far between for jaded adults, though younger ones may well find unbounded delight in the light show, as did one young person at the critics screening I attended last night. He continually beamed, often broke out in laughter and displayed not one iota of cynicism throughout the endless running time, which made it pass a little more quickly for me.  Indeed, this movie may be perfect family entertainment. The IMAX presentation looks smashing and sounds spectacular. Never mind the ceaseless death and destruction. Let the kids go and enjoy. Just keep repeating to yourself: “It’s only a movie. It’s only a movie.” The film opens in Dallas, Fort Worth and surrounding cities on Friday, February 17, via Walt Disney. For more information about the film, visit the official site.

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," If you’re hungry for that third Avatar movie, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania might satiate you, at least for the moment. Largely set in the “Quantum Realm”—a sub-atomic world discovered by scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas)—the movie features enough oogly landscapes and googly creatures to power two Star Wars pictures and half a Dune (David Lynch’s, of course). From the first slug horse, I was in. And I mostly stayed there, despite my ambivalence about the two previous Ant-Man pictures directed by Peyton Reed (Ant-Man, Ant-Man and the Wasp). The clarity and imagination of the world-building carried me through, as well as the fountain of charm that is Paul Rudd, returning here as Ant-Man/Scott Lang. Enjoying life as a superhero celebrity at the film’s start, Scott is challenged by his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) to not rest on his laurels but risk his privilege for the good of others. This becomes a very real scenario when he, Cassie, and Hank—along with Hank’s daughter Hope/Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer)—all get sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they meet a civilization struggling under the boot of a brutal oppressor. (Spoiler ahead?) There is a lot of build-up to the reveal of this character, partly, I suspect, because he’s being positioned as the super-villain of the next batch of MCU movies. At first Jonathan Majors (The Last Black Man in San Francisco) delivers in the part. As Kang the Conqueror, he carries a sense of weariness and hurt, as if the world-dominating drive within him is something of a curse. But then the long, thoughtful pauses begin to feel mannered, while the bursts of violent rage verge on the comical. (I was also never sure as to the limits of Kang’s powers; apparently he’s something like a nuclear Darth Vader.) We’ll see where Majors eventually takes the character, as Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania makes one thing abundantly clear: there is plenty more Kang to come. "
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania starts the MCU's Phase Five on uneven footing. The film throws every can of paint in the garage at the screen while struggling with tone and convincing character dynamics. There are abstract new settings and an assortment of supporting aliens that are difficult to name without looking at a cast breakdown. Quantumania does achieve one important goal, though. Jonathan Majors is an absolute beast as Kang the Conqueror. The multiverse super villain lives up to the hype.   Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has become an A-list celebrity. His turn as an Avenger and Blip-reversing heroics have solidified stardom. Everyone wants a selfie and autograph. Meals are on the house. Baskin-Robbins names him ""Employee of the Century."" There are lines out the door for his book readings. He relishes fame while his significant other Hope (Evangeline Lilly) uses Pym Particles for the public good.   Eighteen-year-old Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) has followed in her father's troublemaker footsteps. She's constantly getting arrested. Cassie believes that Scott can do more to help people. Saving the world, defeating Thanos, and bringing billions back from disintegration just isn't good enough. Apparently, papa needs to put in more effort.   A family dinner leads to Cassie showing her and Hank's (Michael Douglas) new project. She's invented a beacon that can send and receive subatomic signals to the Quantum Realm. A horrified Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) pulls the plug too late. The device generates a portal that sucks them in. Scott and Hope activate their suits as everyone tumbles apart. She grabs her parents while Scott secures Cassie. Two groups land in a strange and exotic environment. Janet has kept dark secrets about her decades apart. A terrifying threat hunts them. They must find Scott and Cassie before he does. Kang (Majors) cannot be allowed to escape his imprisonment.   The previous Ant-Man films showed the scale of his abilities against known objects. Scott shrinking cars or riding a flying bug through San Francisco looked cool because everything was relatable. You know the size of a building in comparison. The Quantum Realm is akin to living in a technicolor petri dish. There's an overload of visual stimuli that detracts from the action. Huge amoeboids soar while CGI goop critters get friendly with the protagonists. The size-shifting gimmick doesn't work until they fight Kang's humanoid forces in the climax. I also don't understand why Ant-Man moves so slowly in giant form. He lumbers when there should be no difference in speed.   Quantumania bounces back and forth from silly to serious. Scott and Cassie joke around while Kang is a walking scowl. There balance between lighthearted and intense could have been more delicate.

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is in a good place, his newly published book on his Avenger exploits rejuvenating goodwill for him in his San Francisco neighborhood.  But his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) thinks he’s coasting on his laurels instead of helping people while her recent arrest at a peaceful protest has him in denial about his little girl growing up.  Granddad Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) is all too happy to mentor, though, but while her subatomic telescope into the Quantum Realm is impressive, the signal it sends is exploited to suck the whole family along with Hank’s ants back to the place Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) is terrified of returning to in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is in a good place, his newly published book on his Avenger exploits rejuvenating goodwill for him in his San Francisco neighborhood.  But his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) thinks he’s coasting on his laurels instead of helping people while her recent arrest at a peaceful protest has him in denial about his little girl growing up.  Granddad Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) is all too happy to mentor, though, but while her subatomic telescope into the Quantum Realm is impressive, the signal it sends is exploited to suck the whole family along with Hank’s ants back to the place Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) is terrified of returning to in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Director Peyton Reed (""Down with Love,"" ""Ant-Man"") returns to his corner of the MCU, this time to kick off Phase 5 and the villain, Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors, containing multitudes), who dominates the Multiverse.  Reed and writers Jack Kirby (""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"") and ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live's’ Jeff Loveness maintain the humor that defines this subseries and while the film is laden with a new purpose and a new world that marks this one something like the extended Lang family visits Disney’s “Strange World” by way of “Star Wars,” it is more entertaining than its predecessor (“Ant-Man and the Wasp”). 
While Hope Van Dyne (aka Wasp, Evangeline Lily) and her dad are along for the ride, the story dynamics are mainly between Scott and his daughter and Janet and Kang, one of many secrets she’s kept from her family about her decades caught in the Quantum Realm.  The film actually begins with a flashback that shows Janet on her homestead in the Realm, complete with horse-like creatures with snail heads, being attacked by creatures that fragment into two.  She’s suddenly assisted by a stranger who claims to have crash-landed, but as we will learn, his seeming benign nature will be unmasked when she gets a glimpse of his brain while fixing his neuro-kinetic ship and sacrifices everything to keep him stranded.
Hope and her parents are separated from Scott and Cassie, each group going off on separate adventures but both learning that the name Janet is recognized everywhere and for very different reasons.  Scott and Cassie cause trouble for the QR’s Jentorra (Katy M. O'Brian) by drawing Kang’s interest in the form of his stormtrooper-like soldiers and his hunting killing machine M.O.D.O.K. (Corey Stoll), none other than Darren Cross (aka Yellowjacket) now looking like evil Humpty Dumpty.  Hank is in for a surprise by the insinuations of Janet’s ‘old friend’ Krylar (Bill Murray), but she’s in for more of a shock to learn he’s switched allegiances.  The ensuing bar fight will be amusingly capped off when Hope pulls a fast one enlarging an appetizer.  Of course, they’ll all be reunited, including Hank’s ants, for a climactic MCU battle royale, Cassie’s heroic instincts now as great an asset as her smart-assery (‘It’s never too late not to be a dick.’) 
There were umpteen special effects houses employed on this film and the Quantum Realm is more organic than one might expect, boasting all manner of fauna and flora.  One of the film’s best new creatures is Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), two eyes on pink stalks inside a glass dome fascinated by the fact that humans have ‘holes’ and the seeming shape spec for Jentorra’s spaceships.  But while the effects are notable, so too is the end of Rudd’s claim to never-aging fame, the actor now appearing recognizably middle-aged.

This latest entry into the Marvel Comics Universe marks the jump-off point for phase 5 of the MCU. (Whatever that means.) To me, “Quantumania” is just a continuation of the “Marvel thing” that began with “Thor” and “Iron Man.” Since then, there have been, I am guessing, dozens of entries into that universe and the result is one of diminishing returns.
There is a mechanical nuts and bolts purpose to this “further adventures of Ant-Man and his friends.” But, there is a lack of artistry and story in favor of bombastic F/X, lots of flashing lights and a whole bundle of monsters, Quantum People fighting for their existence and a bad Bad Guy named Kang.
Of course, the adventurers – Scott, Hope, Hank and Janet – must fight for their lives (sort of, though I never felt they were in any real danger of being perished). Peyton Reed returns to direct his third installment of the Ant-Man saga and it seems that Scott’s amiable good nature that made the character so likable is now overshadowed by the noise of the F/X. Story does not seem to matter anymore in the MCU.
Usually, when I have to sit through yet another Marvel movie, I can expect a couple of things. There is a 20 or so minute finale that throws the kitchen sink at you in an F/X extravaganza, 10 minutes of credits and one or two under the credits stingers. But, there is a difference with “Quantumania.” The expected bombastic ending is over thirty minutes long and is only that – bombastic.
At best, the Ant-Man entries should really be about 90 minutes long, have more humor and less kitchen sink being thrown at me. I can tell the MCU creators are running out of ideas. There is one scene when our stalwart heroes enter a bar in the Quantum Realm and it felt, suspiciously, like a similar scene from the first “Star Wars” movie but with a bigger budget. reviously, Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and her family opened a tunnel to the Quantum Realm to find Hank Pym’s (Michael Douglas) long lost wife, Janet (Michel Pfeiffer).

"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,A big&#44; dumb blockbuster that can&apos;t decide whether it&apos;s a crazy comedy or a gritty drama&#46; A huge contrast between tone and narrative leaves this one feeling far too uneven&#46;&#46;&#46; Tired of being continuously introduced to the Multiverse&#46; Time to get on with it&#46;
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Directed by Peyton Reed.
Starring Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Jonathan Majors, Kathryn Newton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Bill Murray, Katy O’Brian, William Jackson Harper, Jamie Andrew Cutler, David Dastmalchian, Randall Park, and Corey Stoll. Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne, along with Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne, explore the Quantum Realm, where they interact with strange creatures and embark on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they thought was possible. Initially, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania positions itself as attempting to explore fractured parental relationships due to lost time by utilizing parallel storylines. Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) finds himself bailing out his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) from jail, imprisoned for nobly standing up against police injustice that has been tied to “The Snap” with people losing their homes from financial instability. She’s a rebel activist increasingly growing disappointed that her father is more interested in being a guiding parental force rather than an Avenger fighting crime. He wants to spend time with her, and she wants to make a difference in the world like he already has. Likewise, Hope Van Dyne/Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) reconnects with her mother Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), previously stuck in The Quantum Realm (a dimension entered through subatomic particles that exist outside time and space), and her estranged father Hank (Michael Douglas), the original Ant-Man. There’s the usual comedic banter to be expected from these movies (once again directed by Peyton Reed, this time from a script by Jimmy Kimmel Live! writer Jeff Loveless), which is mainly dropped (and not funny when it tries) once Cassie’s scientific experiments (she builds a way to communicate through digital signals from between realms) gets the family sucked into The Quantum Realm. Once stranded inside The Quantum Realm, the script splits these characters up, presumably to better focus on the friction between them, while attempting world-building for what appears to be an alien desert land. Barring some expensive and impressive CGI visuals and some wacky concept designs (including sentient buildings that fire weapons, pink bubbly creatures inexplicably obsessed with holes, and a unique steering wheel design for aircraft flight), the place never truly comes alive. That’s partly because the story itself of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is busy; what started as a criminal turn superhero bonding with his activist criminal teenage daughter has suddenly turned into, as advertised, a sci-fi adventure but without much intrigue. During the portion with Wasp and her parents lost in a different area, Janet is reunited with an old friend played by Bill Murray, and somehow, even that scene bores. The first act also features much backstory and exposition, as Janet speaks of her first time there and time around a villainous madman turning the land into his kingdom. That man is scientist time traveler Kang the Conqueror (a nuanced but relatively nuts and expressive performance from incredible rising star Jonathan Majors, previously seen playing the character on the Loki TV show). Jonathan Majors should also be referred to as “the defibrillator” because his eccentric and imposing performance gives the film desperately needed life. Essentially, Kang the Conqueror revels in time-hopping and overthrowing alternate dimensions, deleting them from history. He has murdered quite a few Avengers during those conquests but is unfamiliar with Ant-Man. At one point, Kang the Conqueror quips that The Avengers all start blending, which is unintentionally hilarious as it brings to mind the recent state of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. They do start blending, and there’s not much separating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania from all the properties it’s taking inspiration from for its interpretation of The Quantum Realm. Fortunately, Kang the Conqueror is still an exciting villain presence, playing the role with a great balance between cartoonish and dramatic. When he’s threatening to murder Cassie over and over until Scott is begging to be killed, there’s weight behind that menace. As a fighter, his scenes are intense despite how special-effects heavy the action often is. Jonathan Majors is the real deal as an actor, showcasing a promising future for this phase since he appears to be the ultimate bad guy moving forward. The problem is that the story is put together in a way that cheapens the importance of familiarizing ourselves with the villain in this particular movie. M.O.D.O.K. (a comedic relief CGI monstrosity sidekick complete with a clunky subplot despite a well-meaning message) also aids him. The good news is that Kang the Conqueror does dominate much of the running time once he is introduced, simultaneously elevating the excitement of the surrounding story. He needs a way out of The Quantum Realm and is forcing Ant-Man to do what’s necessary to make that happen. This paves the way for mind-bending sequences involving alternate versions of the superhero and a thrilling climactic battle as large as the character can grow in scale. It’s a shame this all comes at the cost of compelling character dynamics. It’s one thing not to mean much in a cinematic empire that has built itself on epic crossovers and the future, but Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is also unsatisfying and emotionally thin as a standalone narrative. Something is also off regarding the chemistry between Paul Rudd and Kathryn Newton, as if they know the inconsequential narrative has abandoned its themes and is lost in another realm."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," PLOT: After Scott Lang’s daughter, Cassie, accidentally sends a message into the Quantum Realm, things get complicated. And soon, Scott, Hope, and their family face impossible odds after getting pulled deep within. REVIEW: Paul Rudd is a delight. The actor shines at comedy and has been proven capable of bringing on the action. While I’ve not been an avid fan of the Ant-Man films thus far, I appreciated his work and what director Peyton Reed was trying to do. Now we have the third in his trilogy with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. It’s a weird, trippy, and psychedelic adventure and pretty damn entertaining. With the return of Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas, we have an imaginative science fiction sequel that would fit right in with Doctor Who or Star Wars. The humor is well intact, yet the happenings here are more impactful on the MCU than the previous two films featuring Scott Lang. Did I mention weird? With Ant-Man and the Wasp, Michelle Pfeiffer took on the role of Janet Van Dyne, Hope’s mother. She was lost in the Quantum Realm for thirty years and finally rescued. And this time around, Janet plays a much more significant part in the story. After Scott’s now eighteen-year-old daughter Cassie (played this time by Freaky star Kathryn Newton) invents a device to connect to this mysterious place, she makes one major mistake. When Janet discovers what Cassie did, she is terrified of the consequences. And her fears prove worthy when they are all pulled into this wild, dangerous hidden universe. And when they do arrive, Scott and crew realize that Janet is far more capable than they are after she takes charge and attempts to protect them from the powerful Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). I enjoyed the hell out of this flick. And yes, it was the best of the three Ant-Man features for this viewer. Thankfully, I appreciate that Marvel is taking on a more unusual path with this one. Visually speaking, there is much to admire in this beautifully bizarre sequel. The set design and the myriad of creatures that star alongside Ant-Man and crew bring a heavy dose of sci-fi insanity. Many coming out of the screening felt like they were watching a Star Wars flick or something of that nature. They are right. The creatures, the world created, and the magnitude of what Kang is capable of make for an unexpected watch. And having the film’s length of just over two hours makes for an engagingly exciting popcorn and drink type of moviegoing experience. The M.V.P.’s here are Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors as Kang. It was a pleasure to see Ms. Pfeiffer take on such an integral part of this story. The actress brings gravitas and grace to Janet and handles the action sequences beautifully. While this is unlikely to get as much acclaim as Angela Bassett deservedly garnered for her Academy Award-nominated work in Wakanda Forever, Pfeiffer is outstanding here. As for Majors, the actor brings depth and soul to one of the most interesting villains in the current MCU. Here, Kang is a layered and fascinating man capable of horrendous acts, yet there is more to him than that. He and Pfeiffer work exceptionally well together, and it was thrilling to see the two bring such energy to this sequel. As for the rest of the cast, Douglas, Rudd, and Lilly all shine in their performances. Kathryn Newton is terrific as well. The father/daughter storyline adds a lot of heart. And thankfully, the family dynamic makes for a worthwhile thrills and chills flick. Also notable are the surprisingly engaging side characters, especially M.O.D.O.K. Again, did I mention weird? You’ll see what I mean. And then there is a superb cameo for every film lover with Krylar. I will not spoil that one because seeing it play out on an IMAX screen was very satisfying. And besides the fact, it’s easy to find out for yourself, but I’d recommend you don’t. And then there is a gelatinous little creature who would love to have holes. The little fellow offered my favorite moment in the film, one that would give the “Killer Klowns From Outer Space” a little happiness. Along with Reed, screenwriter Jeff Loveness creates a balance between all the elements on display. From the imaginative look of the film to the dramatic tension, it’s a solid sci-fi entry into Marvel. The humor is well placed and rarely lessons the stakes of the more action-oriented moments. It also offers a couple of worthwhile post-credit moments for fans. And considering how big this universe has become, it still plays as enough of a standalone feature that those who haven’t caught the small-screen stories can easily invest in what’s happening on-screen. It’s an easy watch, but with the outlandish nature of the story and setting, the film is likely to be divisive for some. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is funny, heartfelt, and exciting, and the villain is a worthy foe. Pfieffer and Majors shine. Most of the jokes work – with some falling flat – and perhaps there are a few minor visual effects that are less effective, but the weirdness made it work. And man, did I love that final sequence. Again, it was bizarre as hell, but it all ultimately put a massive smile on my face for a couple of hours. Tonally, this may be off-putting for those looking for a more straightforward MCU flick, but I loved the strangeness of it all. And with the film finally arriving this coming Friday, you’ll have your chance to visit the Quantum Realm and kick off Marvel Phase 5."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," 
	With Avengers: Endgame now history and its place in the box office realm currently challenged more by Avatars than any one Marvel character, the MCU, under orders from Marvel chief Kevin Feige, is now entering Phase 5 and using the third cinematic incarnation of Ant-Man and the full-blooded emergence of multi-villain Kang the Conqueror to carry it forward in what is essentially a stand-alone transition movie. 
	Of course, as in any Marvel movie the crux of it all eventually is the action and battles for world supremacy, and that is what our heroes must deal with on two different trajectories as Scott and Cassie are separated from Janet, Hank and Hope – and ultimately their alter egos — when they buzz in to save the day. Keep in mind though, and it is not a spoiler to note: all of this is meant to set up a future set of movies, not necessarily continue this one, as evidenced not only by the inevitable Easter eggs in the closing credits, but also the James Bond-like promise on screen: “Kang Will Return”, but just how (we certainly can look forward to where Avengers: The Kang Dynasty takes us). 
	Majors definitely has strength here, if not nearly the fun of some other Marvel characters, and has already previously embraced one variant in the KCU (Kang Cinematic Universe) as He Who Remains in the Disney+ series Loki. The possibilities are endless, apparently. Rudd is a delight to welcome back in his signature role, as is Lilly. It is also great to see Douglas still going strong and especially Pfeiffer, who gets a lot to do this time and really socks it home. Newton is a keeper as well, no matter where we go from here. Of the various creatures, Veb as voiced by David Dastmalchian is a whole lot of fun. 
	The visual effects team earns their money, no doubt, but as noted really seem more inspired by George Lucas’ world than Marvel’s in terms of all the new merchandisable creatures created for this Quantum leap in the series. Also I have to confess I am getting quite sick of the sorcerer-style flashy and fiery effects so many of these comic book movies revel in. Mix it up next time, guys. 
	The ultimate verdict in all this though belongs to the fans, and the big question is just how they will embrace all that Feige and team have in store as we move into this new phase of the MCU. Stephen Broussard produced with Feige. Peyton Reed directed the Jeff Loveness script, both delivering in time-honored Marvel style.  
	Disney releases Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania with Thursday previews and a full Friday opening, even day and date in China, which means this could have a very pleasant Presidents Day holiday weekend.

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," Wondering if Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is ok for kids? Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has a PG-13 rating and is pretty on par with other Marvel movies. Not as funny as the previous Ant-Man movies, some kids may find the world-building and Quantum Realm a little strange. But if weird’s your thing, welcome to Quantumania. Here’s what parents need to know in this Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Parents Guide. After having lost 5 years with his family in the blip, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is ready to have a normal life with Hope (Evangeline Lilly), and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton). However, after something goes wrong, they find themselves in the Quantum Realm with Hope’s parents, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet vanDyne (Michelle Pfeiffer).  They find worlds, creatures, and enemies they never knew existed…well one of them did. Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors) is looking for revenge and needs Scott to steal something for him. But if Scott gives it to him, it may mean that millions die. Everyone must find a way back home and also save the universe, too.  There is some strong language including some uses of sh*t, a**, a**hole, hell, and words of Deity like g-ddamn. Parents should also know there are some words like d*ck used several times. Another scene also used the word hell repeatedly as in “what the hell?” When it comes to violence, there is a lot of fighting, battles, and monsters in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania which could be too much for young kids. Kang is reminiscent of Thanos in the amount of destruction he creates and causes with no regard to other people besides his own goals and desires.  Usually Ant-Man movies are more humor than action, but Quantumania feels the opposite. Most of the film takes place in the Quantum Realm with scary creatures and monsters and also a rebellion. With rebellions come death. Weapons are used, there are explosions, destruction, and violence is moderate, since some is fantasy violence. Favorite characters are shown in peril and with bloody faces. It can definitely get intense in some moments with some kids sure to hide their eyes and hold onto a parent, but it’s not Infinity War trauma-inducing.  There is no sex or nudity in Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania, but there are conversations about sex. References to “I did it with someone a few times” and “I had needs” and talk about holes. In Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania you can expect to see fighting, death, dark themes, and profanity used by some of the characters. It does have a Marvel meets Star Wars and even Avatar vibe to it. To sum it up, Quantumania is kid-friendly for ages 12 and older, but kids younger than that could also be fine, especially if they’ve seen other Marvel movies. At the end of Loki when Kang first appears in the MCU and time and multiverses were being thrown around, I was so confused. That confusion continued in Quantumania. None of my questions were answered and I don’t know Kang much more than when the film started. The character development was  feeble, although Majors himself is excellent as Kang. His facial expressions and body movements added to his terror. Perhaps Marvel didn’t want to give too much away to just set us up for the MCU’s next baddie villain.  The performances aren’t the problem. Majors, Rudd, and Newton carried the film. The visuals were pretty; I enjoyed the glow-up of the Quantum Realm, but it almost felt too Avatar 2. Let’s throw some visuals and scenery at the audience and let the storyline suffer. The humor of Scott and his pals and crew was sorely missed. Ant-Man was the OG, laugh-filled Marvel movie that didn’t take itself too seriously, until it did. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is serious, with higher stakes and dangerous consequences. When they tried to insert humor we got some random jokes about being a dick and uncomfortable dialogue about sexual needs. Paul Rudd is still charming, but Luis (Michael Peña)? Man, I missed him.  It’s not even that I disliked Quantumania – there’s enough to hold your interest, entertain audiences, and time flew by. Thank goodness for 2 hour movies instead of the 3-hour trend. It was just too many different movies in one. Give me a Lang/Pym/van Dyne family adventure series. It’s not the best Ant-Man movie, and it’s not the worst. But it was a trip, and I wondered what Peyton Reed was smoking sometimes. I half expected the Cantina Band from Star Wars to pop out. You just never know what to expect with Quantumania. If you’re sick of Marvel movies just being funny, then Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the action-packed adventure you’ve been waiting for and a good setup for Phase 5."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," This may be an unpopular opinion amongst the Marvel hive but I actually like both Ant-Man 1 and Ant-Man and the Wasp. I understand their weaknesses but they were both welcome diversions from the big epic Avengers films that proceeded them with likable casts led by the always engaging Paul Rudd. I know a lot of people disagree with me about these films (especially the 2nd one which I admit has 2 weak villains but I think Ghost has compelling motivations for her actions) but it is at least reasonable to expect the 3rd entry in a trilogy to follow the basic pattern and tone of the two previous entries. So when I sat down for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania imagine my surprise to get a film completely different. Some may call that a good thing but I was underwhelmed. In this film we get Scott Lang (aka Ant-Man) trying to teach his rebellious daughter Cassie respect for the rules but her trouble-making spirit lands them both (along with all 3 of the Pyms) back in the Quantum Realm. What then proceeds is 2 hours of Star Wars-like fighting all leading to a fight with the Exiled Kang the Conqueror played by Jonathan Majors. All of this action fit much better in the Loki show, and I don’t think we learned anything new about Kang in the film that we didn’t get in Loki, so what was the point of it all? When they first arrive in the Quantum Realm there is some fun world building and creature designs, but it quickly becomes giant CG city-scapes and it all feels like we are stuck in a video game from 2002. They try to liven things up with a few cameos and a bizarre appearance from MODOK that I won’t go into more but after a while it felt like a slog more than the upbeat Ant-man movies I enjoy. If you like my writing please consider supporting me on my patreon. There are loads of cool perks including weekly exclusive AFI Passions reviews just for patrons. Learn more here. I also was a fan of the first two Ant Man films. Actually the first Ant Man may be my favorite film in the MCU!"
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," Marvel movies have never been excessively attached to the real world, given their affinity for Norse gods, alien warriors, flying wizards, and the like. Still, some of these films had at least a vague sense of tactility, and perhaps the most grounded hero was plucky little Ant-Man, played by Paul Rudd, the perfect smirking everyman of the 21st century. Ant-Man’s power is that he can get very small (though sometimes he’ll switch it up and get very large). He lives in San Francisco with his family and busies himself with fighting petty theft or sabotage at the local lab. The main villain of his last film, the charming Ant-Man and the Wasp, was a criminal restaurateur named Sonny, whose superpower was that he owned a handgun. For Ant-Man’s newest exploit, which has the sprightly title Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, he’s punching up to a slightly higher weight class. Peyton Reed’s film sees the hero battle a grumpy time lord named Kang (Jonathan Majors), who exists on every plane of reality and in every parallel universe, and seemingly aspires to be villainous in all of them. He’s been exiled to the Quantum Realm, a subatomic dominion of swirling purple clouds and strange gooey creatures. And so into that land Ant-Man must delve, taking on Kang for reasons that will surely be made clearer in another sequel due out in the next few years. Pardon me for sounding a little exhausted. No Marvel hero is invulnerable to the franchise’s latest, bleakest obsession: worlds created almost entirely through computer-generated imagery, overlaid on green-screen backdrops that the actors wander in front of while casting awed glances at some outlandish horizon. Doctor Strange recently spent time in the “multiverse of madness,” and Thor blundered into the ghastly “shadow realm” in his last entry; these days, even the films set largely on Earth look pixelated. For its part, Quantumania is mostly unconcerned with our humble planet, where it spends only a few opening minutes reminding us that Scott Lang a.k.a. Ant-Man is happily partnered with Hope van Dyne a.k.a. the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), raising his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), and palling around with Hope’s heroic parents, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). Then that ensemble is sucked into a portal to the Quantum Realm. Janet had previously been trapped there for 30 years, and the whole gang soon learns of her entanglements with Kang, who has become the realm’s despotic ruler. Kang, as played by Majors, already popped up in the Disney+ television series Loki, but you’re forgiven if you didn’t make it through all of that; only the bravest still have the stamina to consume every bit of Marvel-branded content. Kang’s introduction in this film is so portentous that the franchise is obviously rolling him out as their next big cross-series villain. Much like his predecessor, Thanos, he’s given to monologues that are long, thudding, and irritatingly ambiguous. Kang’s problem is that he has a large velvet chair that lets him travel through time (I’m not kidding); this power has tied him into existential knots and possibly genocidal rage. He’s dubbed himself a “conqueror,” but the only thing Majors really manages to conquer is the realm of gravitas, projecting such complete and utter seriousness that I was practically begging him to drop a wisecrack. The prior two Ant-Man films, both of which were also directed by Reed, are delightful because they are light-on-their-feet capers, possessed of real wit and not just the meta winks at the camera that count for laughs in most superhero movies. That cleverness, combined with the special-effect goofiness of people and objects getting big and small, powered the series—and it’s basically been junked here, replaced by a bunch of celestial showdowns between Kang and Ant-Man. Anytime Quantumania allows itself to get a little silly, it’s in much better shape. The script, by Jeff Loveness, a Rick and Morty writer, often has the antic energy of that show, using the “parallel world” conceit to depict whimsical species, including a goo creature who longs to grow orifices and a frustrated telepath (played by William Jackson Harper) who would appreciate it if everyone would please stop thinking about so many disgusting things. Although I missed Ant-Man hanging out in the criminal underworld of San Francisco, he gets a few minutes here and there to joke around with subatomic extraterrestrials, and Rudd rises to the challenge with his usual aplomb. But by and large, the story is in service of the larger Marvel engine, an increasingly creaky machine that nevertheless keeps grinding away, dropping superstar performers into CGI glop because the show simply must go on."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Marvel needs to shape up and make a real comedy, because this self-deprecating quip situation is outta control. In the awkwardly-titled Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Ant-Man is a goofball who repeatedly draws attention to the weirdness of his life as one of the less-impressive Avengers. The tone is unserious without being particularly funny, making it hard to either embrace as light entertainment, or engage with Quantumania‘s greater purpose: Introducing Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) as the MCU’s next big supervillain.  In the wake of Avengers: Endgame, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is resting on his laurels, publishing a dorky memoir and enjoying celebrity life. However, this happy epilogue gets interrupted when he and his family are sucked into the Quantum Realm, where Scott’s mother-in-law Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) was previously trapped for 30 years. We assumed that Janet spent this time hanging out in a deserted timewarp, but it turns out there’s a whole civilization down there. Populated by gloopy creatures, Star Wars-adjacent vehicles, and a rebel community led by a Xena-style warrior (Katy O’Brian), we’re offered some enjoyably silly Quantum Realm worldbuilding and character design. Inevitably though, it’s sabotaged by Marvel’s terrible CGI/lighting situation. The large-scale backdrops may look cool, but every close-up is tinted with a murky bronze or purple light that saps any sense of visual energy. Eurgh. As Scott traverses the Quantum Realm with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Hope van Dyne/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), and her mother Janet, we learn more about Janet’s experiences here—a story that honestly sounds more appealing than the one at hand. Without going into spoilers, I think it’s safe to reveal that Janet had a run-in with Kang. First introduced in the multiverse-hopping spinoff Loki, Kang will be the main villain of the next Avengers movie. But while Jonathan Majors has plenty of screen presence, Kang’s role is far too reliant on pure exposition. To make a supervillain personally compelling, we need to engage with their emotional journey. Characters like Magneto, Killmonger, and Loki all combine strong dramatic performances with interesting political or personal motives. They’re not just some guy monologuing about his desire to conquer the universe, which is basically Kang’s role here.  To be honest, Ant-Man and Kang are a weird match-up. Ant-Man is dorky and ineffectual, better suited to a low-stakes Disney+ dramedy. Meanwhile, Kang is meant to be terrifyingly powerful, foreshadowing an interdimensional apocalypse. Here, screenwriter Jeff Loveness (Rick and Morty) drops him into a thinly-drawn Quantum Realm conflict, with MODOK (a giant floating head) as his comedy sidekick—the film’s most egregious victim of Marvel Quip Disease. This kind of movie relies on creating a sense of peril around characters who are clearly going to be fine, a simple blockbuster task that director Peyton Reed immediately flubs. There are just too many moving parts: Kang, a MacGuffin subplot, the Quantum Realm aliens, a paint-by-numbers father/daughter narrative. Now an adult, Cassie embodies a rather condescending trope: A young woman whose political activism is framed as a lovable act of rebellion, ultimately less impactful than her superhero dad’s ability to protect her. She just isn’t a very interesting character in herself. Nor is Hope van Dyne, who hardly deserves her title billing. Everyone here would be better served if Rudd was allowed to be properly weird and funny, while Pfeiffer and Majors starred in a weightier origin story for Kang. As it stands, Quantumania is neither fish nor fowl. Mostly it exists as connective tissue between different eras of the MCU, displaying embarrassingly little interest in its own main characters. "
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," As the Marvel Cinematic Universe got bigger and bigger and bigger, it was downright refreshing to see something as fittingly small and low-stakes as the Ant-Man films break up all the universe-ending tension. It was nice; after watching the Avengers punch through an exhausting sea of robotic baddies and set up a bunch of Infinity Stone dross, along came Paul Rudd as a smirking, kinda-dumb thief who lucked his way into a shrinking suit he used on a tech heist. After Thanos snapped half the universe away, we flashed back to good ol’ Scott Lang on a caper to bring his mentor Hank Pym’s (Michael Douglas) wife Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) back from the Quantum Realm. They were lighter, more carefree, a much-needed sitcom wing of the MCU.  But times are different, baby; with Marvel entering its fifth Phase, it’s time to introduce the Big Bad for the next couple of cycles — Jonathan Majors‘ scowling, glowering Kang the Conquerer, last seen taunting Loki and Sylvie in the last episode of Loki‘s first season. And what better way to do it than…. plopping him in the middle of a silly Ant-Man movie? That’s just one of many problems at the heart of Quantumania, a film that warps the most effervescent leg of the MCU into another cog in the franchise-building machine.  The stakes start out reasonably familiar: In a post-Endgame world, Scott’s found a modest level of fame as a public-facing Avenger, with the Langs and Van Dynes now fully integrated as a family. But when Scott’s teenage daughter, Cassie (now played by Kathryn Newton, who brings a modest level of charm to the proceedings), but a new device she’s invented ends up sucking Scott, Hope (Evangeline Lilly, who gets little to do here besides being one half of the titular role), Janet, Hank, and Cassie down into the Quantum Realm.  Still, the Ant-Fam don’t get long to marvel at the sights before they’re split up and have to find their way back to each other. Along the way, they learn that there’s a reason Janet never told them about the full, rich universe the Quantum Realm has to offer: there’s an exiled baddie down there known as Kang the Conquerer (Majors), whom she barely stopped from escaping to the big world last time. And they’ve got to stop him before he tries again — especially now that there’s a fresh new crop of Pym Particles to help him escape his microscopic prison. And that’s it, really, with two hours of actors reading off cue cards while standing awkwardly against green-screened spectacle they (nor we) can’t possibly relate to. The beats are exceedingly rote, the Quantum Realm becoming a pastiche of Star Wars and Mad Max, all hero’s journey bromides about linking yourself to grander causes and making sacrifices to save the ones you love. But none of that matters, because no one ever really has to sacrifice — Ant-Man’s gotta stick around for the sequel, the bad guy has several more movies to be in. A quantum multiverse of infinite possibilities means that no one’s ever really gone so nothing means anything. And when it’s all delivered through the miasma of samey CGI art design (some innovative blips and blops aside), that emptiness is delivered loud and clear. That airiness comes through in the performances, too: Rudd feels misdirected, Scott’s journey less an arc than a straight line punctuated by a couple of confused quips. Douglas, at one point one of our most exciting movie stars, grumbles his way through one line after another about his character’s love for ants. And poor Lilly, Hope the victim of a) a third horrible haircut and b) writers who recognized the Wasp as an equal partner to Scott but giving her little to do in the actual adventure (and even less shared screentime with her costar). Newton escapes relatively unscathed, but it’s Pfeiffer and Majors who blissfully get the most acting meat to chew on, particularly in an extended, tenderly tragic flashback of the two of them saving each other in the Quantum Realm before their relationship fractures.  If this review feels a bit listless, it’s because the movie is too — no one seems to want to be there, except maybe Majors, who channels the physicality and playful scorn he leveraged so nicely in Sundance’s Magazine Dreams a month ago into a Kang who can sometimes feel complicated by the burden of omniscience. Too bad the rest of the time he’s just stomping around in a purple cape, waving his hands and screaming as energy beams come out of his hands. Even the much-ballyhooed Marvel cameos feel like a letdown, including one major new addition that both underserves the cult-favorite character it introduces and turns a previous Ant-Man baddie into a limp punchline. (There’s a one-scene wonder of a cameo that’ll remind you of Thor: Ragnarok, and I kinda wish I’d been watching that movie instead.) In trying to be a bit more like the Cosmic Marvel adventures of Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok, this new Ant-Man loses the grounded charm that made those movies… if not exactly good, then at least a neat novelty within the gargantuan scope of the MCU. But director Peyton Reed has to serve too many masters: the Paul Rudd quirk, some Rick and Morty-esque comic fantasia, and a dark, dramatic story setting up a villain we’re supposed to be spooked by for several films to come. If Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a portent of the franchise’s future, Marvel is in real trouble.  Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them. Maybe you’ve just seen Oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathon—or more fun yet, rank!—all of Christopher Nolan’s films. Or maybe you’re one of the few who haven’t seen Interstellar yet. If you are, then you should change that immediately; the dystopian epic is one of Nolan’s best, and with that incredible twist in ...  Which Netflix Country has Interstellar? For whatever reason, The Hunger Games series isn’t available in the same countries around the world. You’ll find the first and second (aka the best) installments in Hong Kong, for instance, but not the third and fourth. It’s a frustrating dilemma, especially if you don’t even have a single entry in your region, which is ...  Which Netflix Country Has Each Movie of The Hunger Games?"

"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," 
	Everyone’s naturally concerned. Janet, however, is petrified. During her three-decade tenure down under, she led a resistance movement against a tyrant. When her husband rescued her several movies ago, it turns out she left behind some unfinished business. A lot of people died. And the despot, who’s only grown more destructive, happens to have a personal connection to Janet. 
	Majors has long used a bruised baritone to give his ordinary and his extraordinary people roles (The Last Black Man in San Francisco, Da 5 Bloods, The Harder They Fall, the upcoming Magazine Dreams) a sense of wariness, weariness, and vulnerability. With Kang, he adds in a layer of something like pity — for himself (his backstory suggests he wasn’t exactly marooned in the QR) and for these humans who, supersuits or not, are no match for him. Even his fits of berserker rage seem laced with a kind of bone-deep sadness. It’s such a layered performance, and by far the single best thing about the movie. Which, not to damn a great actor with faint praise, isn’t a huge bar to clear. 
	The fact that this all becomes the backdrop for what’s eventually a stock rebellion story, which rides on the back of Lang & Co. trying to keep Kang from escaping to our world, doesn’t help matters. Nor does the peripheral stuff that’s meant to enliven things and somehow flatlines. (I am about to type a sentence I never thought I would ever have to write: There’s a Bill Murray cameo here that’s completely pointless and adds absolutely nothing.) Nor does the deep-cut fan service stuff, though if the words “Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing” mean something to you, you may be stoked. Or perhaps not, given how a legacy character gets surprisingly wasted in all this flailing back and forth.  
	The veteran cast members do what they do gamely enough — Rudd’s gonna Rudd, and Pfeiffer is given enough screen time and shouldering of the storytelling that she’s effectively a co-lead. And you can admire, I guess, the fact that director Peyton Reed switches things up by ditching the ring-a-ding vibe of the first two Ant-Man movies for a more somber, almost funereal tone. Those films distinguished themselves not just with Rudd’s deadpan self-deprecation and some peripheral goofiness (pour one out for Michael Peña’s motor-mouthed patter, much missed here), but also via a deft blend of heroics and heist-flick pleasures, down to a Lalo Schifrin-esque score. Quantumania is somehow heavy without feeling substantial, almost desperate in its dourness. Even scattered with occasional wisecracks, it makes Eternals feel positively breezy by comparison. 
	An ant can carry 10-15 times its body weight, yet as the designated kick-off film tasked with setting up the next two-phase, multi-movie/TV arc, Quantumania is still being crushed by having to bear way too much of a franchise burden. The pile-up of previously-in-the-MCU incidents you need to know to get what’s happening is only outpaced by the sheer amount of scaffolding this threequel is tasked with assembling for future endeavors. It’s meant to help usher in a bold new era. So why does it feel like it’s simply one more product coming off an assembly line, one more bit of evidence that — post–loose-end tying and end-of-contract farewells — this universe is still floundering through a Diminishing Returns phase?  
	A cynic would simply cite a “too big to fail” mindset, saying that whatever Marvel and its mouse-eared conqueror puts out will still dominate box-office returns regardless. But the issue here feels deeper, as if the superhero fatigue syndrome you hear about regarding audiences has infected those behind the camera as well. The powers that be have several years worth of narrative mapped out, and given the last few entries in their superhero soap opera, even they seem a little tired by all of it. Until some sort of creative second wind blows in, casual moviegoers and deeply invested fanatics may have to simply keep enduring overly familiar, frustrating placeholders like this. Quantumania revolves around a powerful villain who wants to control time. The movie itself is merely killing time."

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA is the busiest movie of this Marvel trilogy with tons of distracting CGI environments. The sequel is one part STAR WARS and the other part GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY due to the heavy CGI work. Thankfully Paul Rudd carries the movie as the heart of the story but Michelle Pfeiffer and Jonathan Majors steal the show. The Lang and Pym/Van Dyne family are sucked into the Quantum Realm in ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA where a population of strange creatures inhabits the subatomic level in space and time. Trapped, the gang encounters Kang the Conquerer who wants something from Scott. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer return with a teenaged Cassie now played by newcomer Kathryn Newton. The entire family share in the heroic moments Avenger-style. The two prior ANT-MAN movies are the most grounded movies out of all the MCU films with practical sets based in the real world and the core of the story belonging to Scott Lang’s quest to be the best father to Cassie. That storyline pays off in QUANTUMANIA, but the viewer is literally in an all-new world which at first is jarring. The amount of CGI work is impressive, but the backgrounds are really busy with activity and creatures, some of which look like they stepped off a STAR WARS or STAR TREK set. Another issue is that the new setting of the Quantum Realm is too similar to outer space rather than a subatomic set. No one knows what a subatomic space looks like except for the electrical activity in the backgrounds, but it takes time to adjust your expectations and the actors do their part to keep you focused on the character’s plight. Rudd’s Scott Lang is just as endearing as ever with his range of emotions and wit. The everyman is just so easy to root for. Scott faces his most formidable foe with Jonathan Major’s Kang bringing the dread as the villain. Majors avoids the usual cliches and presents his character with a calm demeanor which makes him all the more intimidating because of his nonchalant ways. Pfeiffer’s Janet Van Dyne is the original Wasp to Hank’s Ant-Man but we have not seen the character in superhero mode until now. The actress has some cat-like moves in a few action scenes that may remind viewers of her Catwoman turn in BATMAN RETURNS with Michael Keaton. It was a highlight seeing Pfeiffer own those scenes. Cassie Lang is 18 years of age in the film, and 26-year-old Kathyn Newton (Amber Heard’s doppelgänger) is obviously much older than her character. Unfortunately, it was difficult to suspend that belief and her dialogue didn’t help. The dialogue was a bit foreign at times with the lines veering into corny and often too sentimental. It’s interesting to note that Rudd is not credited as a writer this time around, although he’s listed in the two previous movies. The difference is definitely noticeable."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania works on one key level, establishing Kang the Conqueror as a truly formidable and worthy villain. Yet with its plunge into inner space, ""Ant-Man"" comes up short in almost every other way that matters."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,Visually dazzling&#44; but overstuffed&#44; meandering&#44; clunky and tonally uneven&#46;
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," Peyton Reed’s “Ant-Man” films have generally served as a kind of palate cleanser to the world-ending stakes of the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang is just an ordinary dude, or so they keep telling us, who still can’t really believe that he’s part of the Avengers at all. He gets to be the wide-eyed middle-aged fanboy of the group in those films. In his own films, he’s just living a blue-sky life in San Francisco as an affable single dad and ex-con who was once fired from Baskin Robbins and who has occasional enemies to defeat.  In this third film, “ Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania,” in theaters Thursday, he’s coasting on his own post-Blip celebrity with a best-selling memoir out, lots of fans around town and a generally sunny disposition — when he’s not breaking his teenage daughter Cassie (now played by Kathryn Newton, always an enjoyable presence) out of jail for civil disobedience.  There is a fun, light, sitcom-y touch to these early scenes in which he and his makeshift family, Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) sit around the table for takeout pizza. They use their particle technology to blow up the tiny pie.  But Ant-Man is part of the larger chess board of the MCU, so naturally he’s doomed to be sucked into the multiverse mess, setting up pieces for more Avengers films to come with the introduction of a new villain, Kang (played with a maniacal sorrow by the great Jonathan Majors). And the results are mixed. Reed has returned to direct with a new writer, Jeff Loveness, who has also been tapped to write “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty” and it’s hard not to empathize with both for the logic gymnastics required to back Ant-Man and his gang into this conflict.  Loveness, who cut his teeth in comedy and has an affinity for comic book and B-movie absurdities, gives Ant-Man his own “Star Wars”-adjacent adventure. There’s quite a bit of unrest in the Quantum Realm, with scrappy rebels battling against a powerful ruler with an army of faceless soldiers. But he takes that conceit further and gives the rebels some personality and humor, including William Jackson Harper as the mind-reading Quaz. The villain’s a killing machine, M.O.D.O.K., that looks (knowingly) straight out of a “Mystery Science Theater 3000” movie and it is quite entertaining. It’s both a nod to the fun of the ridiculousness in sci-fi and a reminder that Serious Superhero Films are sometimes just one crazy special effect away from being Silly Superhero Films.  “Quantumania” also gives Pfeiffer a lot more to do as we, and Hank and Hope, learn a little bit more about Janet’s 30 years in the Quantum Realm and the various compromises and allegiances she made to stay alive. Pfeiffer is an unambiguous delight and the real center of the movie despite what the title might claim. Ant-Man just finds himself in the middle of the mess, which starts to drag on in a muddle of sci-fi furnishings that individually are probably quite inspired and interesting but together just blend into a dreary mess.  It’s a shame because Reed’s films are generally so crisp and styled and are best when focused on characters, not worlds and Quantum Realms. “Quantumania” shines when it is keeping things light and quippy.  But Kang, for what we can assume are bigger story needs, needs to be more serious. Majors is certainly chilling and captivating, but Kang seems like a mismatched foe for a standalone Ant-Man film and the result is a “Quantumania” that is trying to be too many things. One thing it is not is a Wasp movie, though. Lilly gets a lot to do but not a lot of — or any — character development.  “Quantumania” sticks the ending, however. Without giving anything away, we’ll just say that Reed and Rudd get to return to their sweet spot, with a bit of a twist. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” a Walt Disney release in theaters Thursday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for “some sci-fi action violence.” Running time: 122 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four. "
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," The next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is underway, and for most of post-Avengers: Endgame era, we’ve been wondering who is going to show up in what movie. And much like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness before it, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has run the gamut of who has been theorized to show up. Now that the movie’s release is imminent and some of us have seen it, it’s safe to say that the movie is solidly and definitively an Ant-Man movie and doesn’t try to venture into Avengers territory. If you’re heading into this movie thinking you’re getting cameo after cameo, you’re not. It’s a movie that introduces us to the brilliance of Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror, after we met his variant He Who Remains back in Loki season 1, and we get to see the growth that Scott Lang has had to go through since Endgame. But Quantumania, as a whole, is a solid third movie in Scott’s franchise and a nod to relationships and science, and brings us a fresh take on his daughter, Cassie Lang. Directed by Peyton Reed and written by Jeff Loveness, the movie starts off Marvel’s Phase 5 on a softer note that isn’t as emotionally heavy as some of the Phase 4 entries have been, but it’s still a fun time and a great addition for the character of Scott, played brilliantly (as always) by Paul Rudd. The cast of this movie is, for the most part, doing a lot of the heavy lifting—not that Quantumania is lacking, but the more outrageous aspects of the Quantum Realm work because of how characters like Michelle Pfeiffer’s Janet Van Dyne or Michael Douglas’ Hank Pym sell them. When we do see Evangeline Lilly’s Hope, she’s just trying to keep her family together. The introduction of the younger Avengers has been a long journey throughout Phase 4 of the MCU, and while we have, technically, met Cassie Lang before, this is the first time we’re seeing Kathryn Newton’s take on the character. A brash young woman who is determined to protect those who need her help, Cassie is instantly great. Truly and honestly. Watching Cassie Lang decide to use the gifts that Hank, Hope, and her father have given her for good? Amazing. She uses the technology to shrink a cop car because they threw her in jail. I absolutely love her. But Cassie’s heart is one of the reasons why she’s such an appealing character, and Newton balances her intelligence with her determination to get her father back into the superhero game with ease.  It would be so easy for us to roll our eyes at Cassie Lang’s determination and dedication to helping, but Newton performs it with such earnestness that you can’t help but want Cassie to succeed. And it makes her relationship with her father and their growth there that much more powerful. I, like many, am a sucker for a father/daughter story, and it has been, often, what is the most appealing aspect of the Ant-Man movies—not only for Scott and Cassie but for Hope and Hank and their relationship. It’s a story about the struggle that fathers and daughters can have in understanding each other, but one of the best aspects of Scott and Cassie’s relationship throughout the franchise has always been their ability to know what the other needs. It started with Cassie’s ugly birthday gift, and in Quantumania, it is all about Cassie’s desire to help. Scott often tries to tell her no, but I think even he knows that’s not going to work, and Rudd and Newton fall into an ease with their dynamic that doesn’t feel like a new actress taking over the role but instead just a father and daughter taking charge because they have to. Their chemistry makes this story work. If they couldn’t sell us on them being a father and daughter who care about each other, this movie would fail. But both Newton and Rudd find a balance in their angst and upset with each other and their genuine love for each other, and it’s beautiful to watch. While the movie might be an Ant-Man movie on a technicality, it is really a showcase of the power of Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror. There’s a quietness to Majors’ performance that brings you into his story and captivates you. You want to listen to his every word and believe him, and so, when his true nature as Kang rears its head, you’re reminded of who we are dealing with. It’s a lot to unpack but god does it set a tone for the rest of the Kang dynasty.  There are few actors in this world who could play a myriad versions of the same character and make it work, but you can see in He Who Remains to Kang the subtle ways that Majors focuses his variants and makes them unique. With Kang, his walk and stance show his power, and while He Who Remains was slightly more eccentric, Kang holds your attention and then brings his wrath crashing upon you, and it’s truly captivating.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is very solidly a Scott Lang vs. a bad guy film, but knowing that that bad guy is Kang and what that means in the grand scheme of Marvel makes this introduction to the Conqueror even more powerful.  What we’ve come to know from the Ant-Man movies is that they are funny. They’re exciting, hilarious, and aren’t afraid of being silly. This movie is pretty much the same. I love Veb (a jello-like creature obsessed with how many holes humans have) so much and he’s so silly, but that is a lot of what is attractive about the Quantum Realm in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.  It could have been such a simple, cut and dried movie, but they let us have fun. We see quirky new characters, watch a rebellion fighting, and learn a lot about how Scott Lang’s past influenced Cassie Lang’s desire to help and how it inspires him even when he’s just trying to protect his family. Overall, it is a fun trip into the Quantum Realm and a pretty badass Ant-Man movie. "
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," Super Heroes Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope’s parents Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott’s daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible. Directed by Peyton Reed and produced by Kevin Feige, p.g.a. and Stephen Broussard, p.g.a., “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” also stars Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror, David Dastmalchian as Veb, Katy O’Brian as Jentorra, William Jackson Harper as Quaz and Bill Murray as Lord Krylar. Some of the acting in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was noteworthy. Paul Rudd gave one of his most emotional performances, all while still being witty and funny in his effortless style. Michelle Pfeiffer was also great and showed that she was still fully capable of delivering exciting action sequences. However, Jonathan Majors, as Kang, stood tall above all the rest. His delivery was exceptional and captivating. He stole and commanded all attention whenever he appeared on screen because you always were curious about what he’d do next. Simply put, Majors turned Kang into a pure menace and a force to be reckoned with. Regarding visuals,  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania excelled at creating a bright, colorful, vivid world for audiences to dive into. The Quantum realm genuinely felt like an escape into a unique new world in the MCU. Director Peyton Reed certainly tapped into his love of Star Wars, given the many obvious parallels. Star Wars fans will immediately recognize the similarities as the main characters explore various parts of the quantum realm. I did appreciate the diverse creatures in this other dimension because it was never a given whether a creature would be friendly or hostile. One of the strongest positive elements of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was the theme of time. Whether lost, gained, or perceived differently, the concept of time was fascinating to explore through different characters. This theme was the backbone for Scott Lang’s character and how he connected with his daughter, Cassie. Their bond, through this theme, was a relatable subject to keep audiences engaged. What was also interesting to see was how this theme of time played off entirely differently with a character like Kang. This was a great way to position the hero and villain on opposing sides. The writing for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania left much to be desired. One character that suffered the most was probably Evangeline Lilly’s Wasp. Her character’s name is in the title of the movie, but it felt like her role was diminished and didn’t receive any type of development. She was only there to nag at her mom and kick butt during some action sequences. Then, Michelle Pfeiffer’s character became annoying for taking so long to reveal her secret. It’s OK to create situations that interrupt a character from disclosing something because that builds a good amount of tension or suspense. However, the writing here made her trauma a ridiculous plot device to drag things out. While Jonathan Major’s version of Kang was phenomenal, I do believe that the writing for this movie compromised his character a bit at times too. I thought it was odd, and possibly even a plot hole, to have Kang need anything from anyone in this movie. I was not a fan of having Kang know some things and conveniently, for the sake of the story, not know other things. It felt like the writing contradicted his own character as a result. The Ant-Man franchise is known for its humor, but Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was hit or miss in that department. There were indeed some funny moments whenever Paul Rudd delivered dialogue. However, other jokes entirely depended on the audience’s sense of humor. In my opinion, some of the running jokes ran a bit too long or were just completely missed. I think the biggest miss came with MODOK’s character. After the initial shock of seeing his face, all the jokes afterward fell flat. The comedy in this film didn’t always complement what was at stake in the story. Ultimately, the humor was distracting and took away any sense of urgency that was being built up. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania  was an ambitiously weird, trippy, fun ride but left much to be desired. If it weren’t for Jonathan Major’s performance as Kang, this movie would be a complete fail. I think this film missed an opportunity to break free from the averageness of the previous MCU films in Phase 4. It leaned too heavily into the comedy rather than allowing the story to mature over time. That’s not to say it should have been void of humor, but if this movie’s purpose was to set up the threat that is to come in Phase 5, then I can’t say it accomplished that feat at all. However, the two post-credit scenes at the end were fantastic. Sad to say, but the post-credit scenes were better than the movie itself. I can’t say there’s much value in rewatching Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, although it is worth the watch in theaters. At the end of the day, this was just another Ant-Man movie. Director: Peyton Reed Writer(s): Jeff Loveness Stars: Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Jonathan Majors, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Kathryn Newton, David Dastmalchian, Katy O’Brian, William Jackson Harper, Bill Murray ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA hits theaters February 17, 2023.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," At times a strange and occasionally welcome detour from the expectations thrusted upon a Marvel flick, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” kicks off Phase 5 with massive exposition and little payoff. If you were a fan of the previous two films (guilty as charged) for their low stakes energy complete with the signature Michael Pena fast-talking recap, “Quantumania” couldn’t look and feel more different. By expanding this tiny universe into a bigger (and complicated) narrative scope, it results in a much smaller movie that seeks to jumpstart the next iteration of The Multiverse Saga. The humor is inconsistent, the visuals, while weird and partially engaging, are ugly, and if not for Paul Rudd’s amicable charm and the one, two punch of Johnathan Majors (set up as the next Thanos) playing Kang the Conqueror, the MCU would be in desperate need of some oxygen.  The umpteenth entry in the sprawling, neverending Marvel franchise, “Quantumania” opens with a bridge between its predecessors “Ant-Man” and “Ant-Man and the Wasp” because, like most of these interconnected superhero properties, there’s been 10 movies since the last time Paul Rudd suited up in his own solo outing. By default, all of these movies must now open with what’s the basic equivalent of: “previously on.” Indeed, Rudd’s Scott Lang recollects being an Avenger and enjoying his newfound notoriety during an introductory voiceover. Even he can’t believe how he managed to go from convicted burglar to using Hank Pym’s (Michael Douglas) shrinking particles to travel through time and space, saving half of humanity in the process.  But things get on the weird side in “Quantumania,” which depending on your tolerance and comic book knowledge, could sway your overall enjoyment. I miss the days where Scott used his real-world surroundings for Ant-Man shenanigans (bring back the oversized Pez dispenser!). When Scott’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton - new to the franchise), sends out a signal into the forbidden Quantum Realm, the response immediately thrusts herself, along with her dad, Hank, Janet (Michelle Pfiffer), and Hope, aka the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) into the microscopic world.  The MCU has always been a steady stream of content meant to hype the next installment, but in its heyday, it could be counted on to have solid performers as marquee heroes. Now, with its shifty timelines and expansive television series, things are more of a chore and the visual effects are afterthoughts. “Quantumania” is a huge eye sore where every component is digital aside from the actors who were added in post production. This puts an extra burden on the humans: Rudd and Newton make a good, solid pair and I could’ve done more with the father/daughter mini-training sessions teased throughout the movie.  Still, fans will appreciate the breadcrumbs being laid for the next phase of whatever Marvel is cooking up and if the two juicy post-credit scenes are any indicator, perhaps there might be something to be excited about. Let’s just hope there’s room to grow. "
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," Time works a little differently in the quantum realm, which may explain why the two-hour “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” lasts an eternity. To be sure, even as I entered the theater and took my seat, I found myself succumbing to a familiar, dread-soaked kind of temporal disorientation. Has it really been only three months since the last Marvel movie? And are there really just three months to go until the next one, and another three months until the one after that? Once you get sucked back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe — and the word “cinematic” feels more charitable with each repetition — time swiftly becomes a very flat and cruddy-looking CGI circle. “It’s never over,” I said to myself, unaware that I was advance-quoting the movie’s central villain. Here I could follow the example of Jeff Loveness’ script and spend half this review writing suggestively around the bad guy’s identity, using ominous sub-Voldemort sobriquets like “he” and “him.” But no: His name is Kang the Conqueror, and it may startle you to hear that he possesses a metallic suit, superhuman strength and megalomaniacal tendencies. He’s played by Jonathan Majors, whom you can see giving interesting performances in recent movies such as “The Last Black Man in San Francisco” and upcoming ones like “Magazine Dreams.” In this one, he basically stands around indulging a series of cosmic snit fits, laying waste to the digitally confected scenery and uttering tedious epigrams about time, recurrence and the apocalypse. The Times is committed to reviewing theatrical film releases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because moviegoing carries risks during this time, we remind readers to follow health and safety guidelines as outlined by the CDC and local health officials. But I’m getting ahead of myself. There were reasons to hope that “Quantumania” might be another slick, refreshingly low-key diversion in the style of its two “Ant-Man” predecessors (both directed, like this third movie, by the journeyman Peyton Reed). Released between longer, noisier entries in the overarching Avengers cycle, the first two “Ant-Man” movies were persuasive arguments for the less-is-more principle, with their downsized stakes, upbeat spirits and incredible shrinking superhero, Scott Lang, a.k.a. Ant-Man (the always appealing Paul Rudd). Best of all were their ingenious shifts in physical scale, as Ant-Man’s ability to switch sizes at lightning speed infused the action scenes — seldom a Marvel strong suit — with a rare and playful comic dynamism. He grounded these stories and, on occasion, made them soar. That keenly disciplined sense of scale is one of the first casualties of “Quantumania,” which drags Scott and his allies — chief among them the brilliant particle scientist Hope van Dyne, a.k.a. the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) — down, down, down into the quantum realm and strands them there for the story’s duration. You might recall visiting this microscopic dimension briefly in 2018’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” though spending the length of an entire feature there turns out to be an altogether less enticing prospect. Differences in proportion and perspective scarcely register on this surreally designed yet gloppy-looking orange landscape, which, for all its trippiest inventions — a large fiery jellyfish, a sentient tub of red ooze, a giant, hairy purple tongue monster — never remotely springs to life, let alone stirs your awe. This isn’t world building; it’s more like world barfing. Even when the narrative splits into parallel tracks, there’s precious little differentiation or modulation from one scene to the next. One thread follows Scott and his spunky, semi-estranged teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who are briefly taken hostage by a gutsy freedom fighter, Jentorra (Katy M. O’Brian), and an army of refugees who look like discarded extras from the Mos Eisley Cantina. The other thread follows Hope and her parents, the ant-mad scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), who knows the terrain better than anyone, having recently returned from 30 years’ imprisonment in the quantum realm. Exactly what transpired during those 30 years is gradually revealed through expository flashbacks, a low-grade Bill Murray cameo and several menacing monologues from our lead villain, who’s determined to escape this interminable episode of “Honey, I Shrunk the Kang,” bust out of the quantum realm and wreak havoc on a multiversal scale. “I know how it all ends,” Kang intones on more than one occasion. I have no idea if he’s talking about the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe or just this latest, newly launched phase of it, though in the moment you will gladly settle for a swift conclusion to “Quantumania” itself. What a chore this so-called entertainment is! How strenuous are even its ostensibly funnier conceits, including a secondary villain who’s dredged up from the Marvel archives and placed in service of an especially tiresome running gag. The moments of wit and feeling that occasionally steal into the frame — in Cassie’s stubborn yet affectionate eye-rolls, Hank’s genial befuddlement and Janet’s poignant mix of guilt and resolve — feel like emotional outliers in a flat, inexpressive void. They’re a small saving grace, and so, fittingly, are the ants that march into the story at just the right moments, briefly turning this thoroughly lousy picture into a halfway decent picnic.

****
Jewish actor Paul Rudd reprises his role as Ant-Man in this new adventure of the embattled MCU offshoot. The Ant-Man and The Wasp franchise has often felt like a less essential  component of the current re-imagining of Lee and Kirby's hugely popular output. But now on its third outing, the series finally seems like a fully fledged Avenger adventure. 
After the events of Avengers: Endgame, Ant-Man/ Scott Lang (Rudd) is basking in the glory of his new found celebrity. With the whole of San Francisco wanting a piece of the man who fought side by side with Captain America, Spiderman and many more, Scott has also written a memoir to celebrate being part of the team who defeated the mighty Thanos. 
Scott’s now teenage daughter Cassie - played by Little Women star Kathryn Newton - has been secretly learning all about the Quantum Realm thanks to scientist Hank Pym (legendary Jewish actor Michael Douglas), who also happens to be father of Scott's soulmate Hope/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly). When an experiment goes haywire, Scott, Cassie, Hope, Hank and Hope’s mother Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) are lost in the Quantum Realm where they must fight a deadly adversary (Jonathan Majors) to be able to return home. 
After a slew of disappointing Marvel adaptations over the last couple of years, it feels good to finally have a superhero adventure that does exactly what is expected from it. Returning director Peyton Reed and screenwriter Jeff Loveness seem to have gotten the tone just right this time around. Taking a leaf from Taika Waititi’s own comedic approach to the MCU in the popular Thor films, the duo have opted for silly and outrageous and it looks like it might have finally paid off. 
Aided by a gag-heavy dialogue, Rudd is as breezy, likable and as hilariously funny as we’ve come to expect from Hollywood's most unlikely superhero. Meanwhile, the film seems to also be setting up Newton as a possible replacement for Rudd in upcoming adventures. 
While the storyline often amounts to some barely cogent pseudoscience nonsense, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania seems to have finally  captured the true essence of these offshoot adventures, and about time too. I had a whale of a time with this, and I suspect MCU fans will too.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," It’s  a new phase in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Phase Five, they tell us. Phase Four, despite a couple decent movies and some quite good TV series, felt a little half-baked. No clear goal or thrust aside from the fallout of Avengers: Endgame. Many outside the dedicated nerd sphere might be forgiven for not realizing the final feature in Phase Four  was Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, its final entry period the Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special. Hardly a rousing culmination. Phase Five, however, at least begins with a booming statement. The movie may be Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but we are in the  Age of Kang. The Thanos of it all has given folks a major question mark going forward. Such a compelling and intimidating villain is hard to follow. And, let us not forget Marvel Studios’ long history of lackluster villains (or great villains who die too soon). They needed to make their next Big Bad just as interesting as Thanos but markedly different. Jonathan Majors’ Kang, it appears on first blush, is just such a villain. Scary, cruel, confident, yet deep and almost remorseful at times. Majors’ glassy-eyed moments between evil deeds gives Kang so much more heft than he might have otherwise.  The usual problem is a villain who seems out of step with the movie; here it’s a hero who feels at odds with the tone of his own film. Paul Rudd is just as charming as ever and moments of Quantumania showcase the dry humor that made his Scott Lang and the first two Ant-Man movies so fun. Here, he and the other main heroes are completely outmatched by the baddies, the colorful and weird Quantum Realm, and the strange characters we meet within it. Years after the Blip, Scott Lang has written a memoir about his adventures and, though happy, seems rudderless and content to live off his celebrity. Not true for his partner Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) who has relaunched her father’s company and become a pillar of the scientific community. His daughter Cassie (now played by Kathryn Newton) has become a proponent of civil rights, entering the film in jail for trying to prevent police from breaking up an unhoused encampment. She’s fighting for her beliefs, and has become a scientist in her own right. She, along with Hope and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), have created a satellite to the Quantum Realm. This news comes to the chagrin of Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) who still has not told her family the horrors she witnessed during her 30 years within the Quantum Realm. And she’s right to be afraid; not two seconds after they turn on the satellite does the device suck all five of them into it. Someone has a score to settle with Janet and doesn’t care who else gets hurt along the way. Kang, it’s Kang. Unlike the first two Ant-Man movies, which balanced family comedy-drama with goofy superheroics and a helping of quantum weirdness, here it’s all quantum. Yes, we have some humor, and a lot of it is really funny. William Jackson Harper, who plays a mind-reading denizen of the Quantum Realm, has a particularly funny few scenes. Bill Murray plays a wealthy former associate of Janet’s and does his Bill Murray thing. I also need to give special commendation to M.O.D.O.K., aka the former Darren Cross (Corey Stoll). Director Peyton Reed and the actors understand how silly the  Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing actually is and steer into it beautifully. Stoll’s giant, stretched face is as goofy as it gets and yet they make it work within the context of the movie. As much as I generally dislike when the movies take the piss out of the comic books’ inherent out-thereness, it needed to happen with M.O.D.O.K. The problem is, despite some very nifty set pieces and some laughs, the meat of the movie is Kang and not with any of the heroes. Is this a problem in general? No. But it seems as though the script attempts to give Scott and Cassie a throughline that sort of fizzles out; Hank Pym gets to do some fun stuff but doesn’t have much in the way of an arc; Janet and Hope likewise seem to start from a place of conflict and it doesn’t go where it should. And for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp, Rudd and Lilly share shockingly few meaningful scenes. As a movie to properly foist Kang the Conqueror onto the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania succeeds and then some. I can’t wait for the next appearance of Kang and/or his many proposed variants. As a movie for the Pym/Lang/Van Dyne family of size-changing heroes? It’s only just fine."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,Quantumania starts Phase V off with a mixed bag&#44; sporting a tour-de-force villain in Kang&#44; who is smothered by a VFX mess&#44; a sluggish plot and way too many painfully weird characters&#46; 
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," At this point, the complaints, and issues that one might take with the Marvel superhero movies are just a part of the reality. CGI-green screen settings and storylines so large it’s impossible for the human mind to fear any of the stakes, that’s just how these movies go. And to be quite honest, I’m not exactly sure what will get it out of that groove, but there might be a clog in the middle of the pack. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania hits right in the center of recent Marvel content. It’s adventurous and energetic. It’s also hollow and not separating itself from others. In many ways, it’s a standard installment into the MCU, elevated by great work from Jonathan Majors, and enough heroics to make Quantumania an intergalactic escape. On one hand, this Ant-Man is achieving what Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Thor: Love and Thunder failed to do. On the other, it’s also not very Ant-Man-like. We catch up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and his circle of super friends. He’s happy and finally an Avenger recognized by others. He’s grown closer to Hope Van Dyne aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), and now connecting with her mom Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and scientist father Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). What’s new now is that his daughter Kassie (Kathryn Newton) is getting involved with all the high-tech super gadgets. She’s found a way to map out the Quantum realm, but when a signal reaches out, a mysterious force sucks them into the zone between universes. In this realm, they are approached by a man named Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a man that can mess with time and space, and will destroy anyone who threatens his plans. From the onset, Quantumania is more relatable to an episode of Star Trek than any other MCU installments. Once we arrive in the Quantum realm the universe expands, filled with creatures with glowing heads, spaceships that have tentacles for controls, and liquids consumed to understand alien languages. The direction from Peyton Reed, along with the screenplay from Jeff Loveness, allows us to study the terrain, which looks like glowing spores of mushrooms mixed with glittering goop, and still keeps the energy moving. The action gracefully shifts to be about Kang and his space henchmen tracking down Scott and crew. It’s the story itself that has the jet propulsion, a bit too much exposition at times, but a blend of humor and alien shootouts keeps the excitement high. The negative side is just how these movies are made. It’s weird to see Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer, two actors with great bravado, delivering dialogue against green screen backdrops. Something about it feels quite anti-cinema. But you hold that up to the Shakespearean delivery of Majors— portraying the role of Kang in a tragic and callously evil way– and it seems like Quantumania knows exactly what it’s trying to be. It’s taking us to another world and letting Ant-Man be a hero for once. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania ultimately feels like a bigger stakes adventure– something typically reserved for all the Avengers– but it’s also cool to see Rudd get his chance to flex beyond the caper hijinx. It’s middle of the road Marvel universe building. It’s another installment and leading up to more installments. That’s just what these movies are now. Some will hate that. Some will enjoy it just fine. I’m certainly excited for more Jonathan Majors. All we have is time when it comes to the MCU."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Alongside the Iron Man trilogy and what we’re presumably now calling late-period Thor, the first two standalone Ant-Man adventures always felt like Marvel at its glossiest and perkiest. Why? Nothing to do with their storylines or effects: it all came down to them having been carefully tuned to the particular talents of their lead.  Just as Robert Downey Jr had his motor-mouthing suavity and Chris Hemsworth his beefy comic chops, Paul Rudd was the stumbling, affable, everyman Avenger: the little chap who would rise to the moment, or more often shrink to it, in times of need. Anyway, that time-honoured strategy is nowhere to be seen in this splurgily generic third instalment, in which most of Rudd’s considerable charm, and those playfully ingenious real-world shifts in scale – think the 2015 original’s Aardman-homaging train set battle, or the 2018’s sequel’s San Francisco car chase, with its vehicles zipping down to Hot Wheels size and back – are cleared off-screen to make way for another two-hour blast from Marvel’s inexhaustible multicoloured CG gunge hose. This latest adventure sees Rudd’s Scott Lang (AKA Ant-Man), Evangeline Lilly’s Hope Van Dyne (AKA The Wasp) and Scott’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton, insect alter ego name pending) sucked down into the Quantum Realm: a “universe beneath our universe”, and the current dwelling place of the evil Kang the Conquerer, the franchise’s latest superbaddie-in-chief.  For fans, the arrival of Kang (Jonathan Majors, regal in an emotionally fragile Darth Vader way) marks the dawn of Phases Five and Six of the Marvel audiovisual content project: 10 more films and five more Disney+ series to tide us all through the next three years. But as far as the film at hand is concerned, it just spells another jumbo dollop of dimension-bending digital sludge, dished up with the usual multiverse caveat that every plot advancement can and probably will be annulled or reversed in the mid-credits scenes. So we get lots of Rudd, Lilly and Newton, along with the returning Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer, having stilted conversations on various green-screened fantasy landscapes, or reacting to whatever monster or spacecraft or convulsing green and purple whatsit happens to be wibbling overhead. The problem isn’t that the joins between the flesh and blood and CG worlds are always obvious: sometimes they are; sometimes they’re not. It’s that the type of storytelling this technological approach aligns with is impersonal, emotionally empty, and often borders on meaningless. For instance, Pfeiffer’s Janet van Dyne uncovers Kang’s evil scheme not by cleverly wheedling it out of him, or thrillingly sneaking into his base, but via a vision when she touches the hull of his psychic spaceship. This stuff might jostle the plot along, but it just isn’t how fun works, and you get the feeling the film is guiltily aware of it. The lack of pleasure in the writing is offset, or perhaps drowned out, by the arduously wacky visuals: lots of eccentric creature design that works very hard to remind you of Star Wars (there's even a cantina scene, featuring the much-touted Bill Murray cameo), as well as a climactic battle which resembles those new mobile phone games where the player has to mow down an endlessly advancing horde. For a franchise in need of refreshment, it’s anything but a quantum leap."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," Marvel’s 15-year-long success has hinged, to a significant degree, on its expert casting. From Robert Downey Jr. as cocky tycoon Tony Stark, to Chris Evans as aw-shucks heartthrob Captain America, to the late Chadwick Boseman as regal and wise Black Panther, the studio has thrived precisely by finding the ideal people to play its popular larger-than-life parts. Certainly, that’s true of the Ant-Man movies, which would be even more humorless and second-rate if not for the innate charm of Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, a thief-turned-hero who’s the beneficiary of a techno-fangled suit created by Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) that allows him to magically make himself bigger and smaller. Ant-Man is a peripheral Avenger at best, and his two big-screen outings—both directed by Peyton Reed—have been functional almost-funny placeholders in the Marvel schedule, intended to temporarily satiate devotees in-between more spectacular A-level events. Still, Rudd can’t help but be amusing, and his good-natured likability has gone some way toward justifying the character’s persistent prominence in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), even if he’s fared better in Avengers blockbusters than in his own stand-alone tales. Rudd’s shrinky-dink do-gooder once again takes center stage in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (which hits theaters Feb. 17), and just as readers will likely get lost in its gobbledygook subtitle, so too does Rudd get swallowed up by the consuming CGI insanity of his latest comic book extravaganza.  A chore of diminishing returns, it’s an adventure that plays out almost wholly on green screens, here used by desktop artists to realize the Quantum Realm, a subatomic world that resembles a cross between Star Wars and Avatar, except with far more garish and muddy blues, oranges, and yellows. It’s a murky mess of an artificial setting that no doubt made filming during COVID easier, not that the pandemic is any excuse for the chintzy aesthetics and leaden writing of this forgettable franchise entry. Scott is living the celebrity good life at the start of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but things are rocky with his teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), an arrogant wannabe-activist who bristles at her dad’s desire to coast on his former glory rather than affect positive change. In her free time, Cassie is also a scientific genius who’s constructed a telescope that’ll map the Quantum Realm, which greatly impresses Scott, his partner/girlfriend Hope van Dyne, aka Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), and Hope’s dad Hank. However, Hope’s mom Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who spent 30 years trapped in the Quantum Realm, finds this invention of great concern. Her fears quickly prove well-founded when, before she can voice her objection, everyone is sucked into the micro-land, where it turns out a multiverse-traversing villain named Kang (Jonathan Majors) has been exiled. If Janet had simply warned her loved ones about tyrannical Kang from the get-go, the entire ensuing saga could have been easily avoided, but Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania repeatedly has Janet withhold vital information as an unbelievable means of forwarding the plot. Worse, Jeff Loveness’ script operates only via clichéd declarations of love and togetherness, and word-salad exposition dumps about Kang’s origins and purpose. From his semi-comprehensible diatribes, one gleans that he’s a powerful visionary who learned how to traverse time (which is a “prison”). After seeing that the various multiverse versions of himself were actually breaking time (whatever that means), Kang waged war against his doppelgangers, the goal being to destroy every universe that opposed him. Or something like that. He also suffered great losses, although fans will apparently have to wait to hear about them in future films. In the Quantum Realm, Scott and Cassie team up with local alien rebels who look like gelatinous amphibian rejects from George Lucas’ sketchbook, and Hank, Janet and Hope have a sit-down with Janet’s former flame Lord Krylar (Bill Murray, in a thankless appearance). Shortly thereafter, they encounter M.O.D.O.K. (Corey Stoll), a giant-headed weirdo-weapon that was once Scott’s nemesis Darren Cross, and then square off against Kang, who—as explained by a lengthy, lethargic flashback—is really mad about Janet thwarting his prior attempt to escape this teeny-tiny domain. Between Cassie inspiring revolt (alongside an indigenous female warrior) and Hank cheering on socialism (inspired by his super-smart ant buddies), the film strives to champion revolutionary progressivism, which—given its nature as mass-market Disney/Marvel corporate product—is arguably the only hilarious thing about Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.  Well, that and the filmmakers’ dogged efforts to relegate Lilly to the sidelines; Hope is an afterthought throughout this odyssey, calling into question why she receives title billing in the first place, and negating the emotional impact of her lovey-dovey moments with Scott. Meanwhile, as befitting the action’s general listlessness, comedian Gregg Turkington and I Think You Should Leave scene-stealer Ruben Rabasa are wasted in pointless cameos. Majors cuts a striking figure as Kang, his imperious rage laced with underlying hurt. Yet at least in this incarnation, he’s only a semi-realized madman. That’s likely due to the fact that, as Marvel’s new reality-threatening Big Bad, Kang is being kept partially in the shadows in order to facilitate grander reveals down the road. Nonetheless, it exacerbates the sense that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a lot of weightless, lifeless set-up.  If there’s any justice in the multiverse, the follow-ups that arrive in its wake won’t require the participation of Douglas and Pfeiffer, who are reduced (pun intended) to embodying two-dimensional cornball nobodies in a story that cut-and-pastes with embarrassing and depressing abandon. Rarely giving Rudd a chance to crack a joke, so busy is it forcing him to sprint around glowing platforms and floating rock formations, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania eventually runs out of ideas altogether, resorting to a climactic fistfight to settle its conflict.  While any respite from energy-beam showdowns is a minor victory when it comes to modern superhero affairs, the sheer lack of imagination on display remains enervating, right up to a finale that makes a joke out of the proceedings’ inconclusiveness. The MCU may think itself so invincible that it can safely continue churning out subpar ventures such as this (and Shang-Chi, and The Eternals), but few more duds and it’ll learn the lesson that Kang himself inevitably will: time isn’t forever on its side."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," It’s hard to know how seriously to take “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” because it doesn’t know how seriously to take itself. A sci-fi comedy constantly interrupted by crude teases for future sequels, Marvel’s 31st feature attempts to bridge the gap between two overarching “sagas” — its previous long-running story leading up to “Avengers: Endgame” and its next series of major crossovers. The film also tries to tell its own story,  originating from comic book fictions yet still rooted in contemporary facts. Even the fantastical, child-friendly rebellion of pink goo-people against their evil emperor alludes to our ugly real-world politics. But the film’s ham-fisted treatment of these allusions reflects a familiar limitation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where super heroes rescue and avenge without caring much about the bigger picture, despite occasionally delivering dialogue that suggests otherwise. Paul Rudd once again plays size-shifting hero Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who has become a happy-go-lucky celebrity in the wake of his role saving half the world’s population in “Avengers: Endgame.” During that episode, Scott was trapped in the Quantum Realm for Earth years that passed like hours for him, during which his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) grew into a self-sufficient, rebellious teenager who does (off-screen) battle with the San Francisco police while defending homeless encampments populated by people who re-appeared after “Endgame” (an event labeled “the blip”). Scott’s superhero girlfriend Hope/The Wasp (Evangeline Lily) is said to engage in some kind of nebulous humanitarian work, but she, like Scott, disapproves of Cassie’s militancy and doesn’t have much to say about the encampments. At first, the issue of policing homelessness seems like a fleeting background detail meant to establish a rift between father and daughter. But when a freak accident sends Scott, Cassie, Hope and Hope’s scientist parents, Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet Pym (Michelle Pfeiffer) down to the Quantum Realm, it becomes a thematic linchpin for Scott and Cassie’s relationship. Like so much else, the movie fails to realize its full potential (or any of its potential, really). Although Janet spent much of the last two “Ant-Man” movies trapped in this same realm, it never occurs to her to reveal any of its details or tribal inhabitants to her family. As a result, the characters are surprised when they’re shrunk down to subatomic size and thrust into a hidden civilization in the middle of a civil war between multi-species rebels and a technologically advanced kingdom. That kingdom’s ruler, Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), is an imposing villain with whom Janet is familiar, but since she never mentioned him to the other heroes, the narrative becomes rife with monologues and flashbacks meant to flesh out his backstory. Kang, we learn, is a time traveler also stranded in this realm, so desperate to get the materials he needs to escape that he creates a fascist hierarchy enforced by faceless cyborg goons who oppress the realm’s indigenous tribes. Cassie, a rebel at heart, senses their plight and begs her father to look beyond himself and assist them in their fight. This brings their disconnect over her anti-policing actions full circle. The only problem is that Scott’s goals are coincidentally aligned with that of the local rebels anyway, against the evil Kang. There’s neither familial friction nor altruism involved in his hero’s journey. He opposes Kang to help rescue his own family and get them home. Real-world analogues to the Marvel movies’ political set-pieces are highly charged, from the criminalization of homelessness in “Quantumania” to the persistence of hunger amid plenty in “Avengers: Infinity War.” And yet, the Avengers never tackle any of these persistent problems themselves. In “Captain Marvel,” Carol Danvers turns her back on her alien compatriots, the Kree, when she realizes her powers are being used to target alien refugees. When she finally discards the green and black Kree insignia, she re-fashions her costume using the red and blue of a U.S. Air Force t-shirt, since she was a former pilot. Neither the character nor the film betrays any awareness of the head-spinning hypocrisy of rejecting a fictitious violent institution by embracing its real-world equivalent. (This can be filed under the larger conversation on Hollywood’s continued ties to the Department of Defense). Even in the rare instances in which Marvel heroes use their powers and resources for altruistic good, their actions are generally narrow, if not antisocial. In “Black Panther,” the titular hero opposes his villain’s violent methods of global Black liberation in favor of a science outreach program for a single underfunded Black neighborhood in Oakland, California. In the TV show “The Falcon and The Winter Soldier,” the villainous Flag Smashers fight for equitable housing for those displaced by “the blip” — not unlike Cassie in this film — but by framing the villains’ methods as too violent, Marvel’s creators also prove unable and unwilling to challenge their heroes or present them with the opportunity to do actual good. Predictably, that series ended with the politically muddled conclusion of Falcon vaguely lecturing world leaders about cooperation, with no follow-up on what became of the aforementioned unhoused people. Given this pattern, it should not surprise you to learn that “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” similarly offers zero follow-through on the problems of homelessness and police violence. The result is yet another reactionary superhero. The social void at the core of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is mirrored by the movie’s lack of visual clarity. Although the Quantum Realm is based on the comics’ Microverse, traditionally illustrated with bright, eye-popping designs, its cinematic equivalent is depicted as grey-brown sludge. Its creatures and other inhabitants are all similarly drab; every alien environment is lit with the same dull, texture-less wash. The result is a lack of any shadow or contrast that might have prevented the CGI elements from blending together, or possibly introduced some dramatic subtext to the actors’ faces, rather than lighting them like weather reporters against obvious green screens. Real-world analogues to the Marvel movies’ political set-pieces are highly charged, from the criminalization of homelessness in “Quantumania” to the persistence of hunger amid plenty in “Avengers: Infinity War.” Between the wide range of alien character designs, and the light orientalism of their Bedouin-inspired garb, it seems the folks at Marvel tried their hand at their version of a “Star Wars” film. (Director Peyton Reed directed two episodes of the Star Wars show “The Mandalorian”; Producer Kevin Feige, meanwhile, is slated to produce his own movie in a galaxy far, far away). However, “Star Wars” movies — whether under Disney or George Lucas — have never been this visually incoherent. “Quantumania” features so little connective tissue between its live-action and pre-visualized elements, and so little care for basic action geography, that scenes meant to feel propulsive end up disorienting instead. What keeps “Quantumania” somewhat enjoyable despite itself is levity. When it isn’t hinting at the oncoming tragedy of future Avengers films, it remains silly, childish. Minor characters like William Jackson Harper’s matter-of-fact mind reader Quaz, or David Dastmalchian’s nervous, shapeless blob, Veb, feel plucked out of a Saturday morning cartoon (or Disney’s own pulp adventure throwback “Strange World”). And while the movie never fully reconciles its two warring tones — what it is, and what it’s advertising down the line — its humor is broad and inoffensive enough to be easily digestible. Its dialogue scenes offer needed respites from the action. The film’s biggest redeeming quality is its cast, starting with Majors’ conception of Kang. A plain villain in the comics whose main concern is conquering all of time, Majors elevates the character’s big-screen introduction beyond what little the script provides. Other than some specific logistics, you could leave “Quantumania” knowing as little about Kang as when the movie began, but Majors turns this lack of concrete detail into a compelling mystery. He stands and walks with an imposing regality, arms gently crossed but always ready to strike. He speaks in quiet whispers that border on polite, reserving his fury and strength for the rare moments when they’re necessary, and his technology is so advanced that he may as well wield the powers of a god. And yet, there’s something deeply sorrowful and lonely about him — something Majors barely conceals beneath his expressive eyes. Wherever Kang’s megalomania stems from, it feels like evil and ambition compelled by tragedy. One can only hope this version of the character shows up in the future (rather than Marvel starting from scratch with yet another iteration played by Majors, as they already have). If Majors is the entrée, Rudd is the dessert, with his usual brand of everyman comedic charm. The Marvel movies tend to be self-effacing, but the benefit of a character like Ant-Man is that he’s never cynical. Unfortunately, Newton, Lily and Pfeiffer are all saddled with little beyond rote, expository dialogue, so it’s difficult for them to be remarkable either way (that Lily’s character shares the title with Rudd’s is a formality at this point; she’s mostly along for the ride). However, where all the other leads are sincere and committed in their approach, Douglas manages to phone in a performance so uninterested in all the quantum junk science rattled off by Hank that it becomes absurd — and funny. Equally absurd is Corey Stoll’s return as Darren Cross, a newly minted Marvel character from the first “Ant-Man,” who’s now been retro-fitted with the enormous cranium and tiny limbs of the comics’ M.O.D.O.K., a cyborg and Kang minion who, like Douglas, feels so out of place that he becomes amusing as well, albeit for completely different reasons. Stoll, with his face digitally stretched and half-rendered across an enormous floating skull, is saddled with cartoonish, naked sentimentality that often rubs up against the film’s more serious universe-building, courtesy of Kang and his monologues, which are sure to become relevant several films from now. This lack of present-ness, the constant cutaways from the main characters to establish potential sequels, infects so much of the runtime that it’s hard not to see “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” as Marvel’s longest trailer yet. In the process, its father-daughter story falls by the wayside and ends up being told through hasty character beats. This becomes all the poorer in taste due to invocations of contemporary political ugliness — i.e. the thematic mirroring between police storming homeless encampments and armed guards attacking displaced alien refugees — that yield disappointingly little by way of story, meaning or even visual comprehensibility. Viewers old enough to understand even rudimentary narratives deserve better than a handful of scattered laughs and a great deal of visual unpleasantness.

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," You can imagine a pitch meeting for “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” — one sticking to references within the Marvel Cinematic Universe — going something like this: “It’s ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ meets ‘Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness’ meets, you know, an ‘Ant-Man’ movie.” All of them star the ever-likable Paul Rudd, as Scott Lang/Ant-Man; “Lost” alum Evangeline Lilly, as Hope Van Dyne/The Wasp; and the great Michael Douglass, as Hank Pym, Hope’s father and once himself the Ant-Man. In those two highly entertaining movies, our heroes exhibit the ability to shrink to insect size — and occasionally to become gigantic — as well as to control an army of ants to help save the day. A science-fiction-inspired, visually dazzling, largely fun but also frequently nonsensical experience, the latest MCU entry — the film that begins Phase 5 of Disney-owned Marvel Studios’ ever-expanding saga — takes us farther into the Quantum Realm. This isn’t your father’s Quantum Realm (or, more accurately, Hope’s father’s QR). This is a deeper-down layer where Hank’s wife and Hope’s mother, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), had lived for 30 years before being rescued by the gang in the second movie. Turns out Janet hasn’t been entirely forthcoming about her experiences in the QR, including what and who resides there. Relatedly, she is alarmed to learn Hank and Hope have been helping Scott’s daughter, Cassie — now 18 (and portrayed by newcomer Kathryn Newton) — with an endeavor to send an exploratory signal into this subatomic inner space. Scott, Hope, Hank and Cassie soon learn what Janet knows, that the world-within-a-world is populated by a wide array of intelligent beings, including blobs, monsters and humanoids, one of whom bears a striking resemblance to Bill Murray. (While the movie’s production notes do not hide Murray’s inclusion in the movie — as Lord Krylar, an old, um, associate of Janet — they do keep secret the appearance of a face from one of the first two movies.) The QR also is home to a powerful presence who goes unnamed for a while — he’s first referred to as “a man” and then “a conqueror” — but eventually is revealed to be Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). Poised to become the new mega villain of the MCU, Kang has MANY variants across the multiverse, one of whom was introduced in 2021 in the Disney+ MCU series “Loki.” That characters regularly withhold information from others and, by extension, to us is one of the irritations of the screenplay by Jeff Loveness, who has penned several episodes of “Rick and Morty” and is a newcomer to the franchise. That “Quantumania” is such a confusing mess is another. (If you always understand what characters are doing and why, you get a gold ant sticker.) Essentially, our heroes need to get home while keeping the wildly powerful Kang from leaving the QR, where he has been imprisoned. Oh, and if they could take him down and free the QR’s inhabitants of his tyrannical reign, that would be even better. On the plus side, Newton is a key addition who, thanks in part to her advanced age, gives the series’ daddy-daughter dynamic a different feel this time around. Cassie, who has gotten in trouble with the law while attempting to help those in need, feels her father is becoming a man of inaction. Newton continues to have that “it” factor. She lights up the screen, just as she did in her previous two movies, 2020’s “Freaky” and 2021 “The Map of Tiny Perfect Things.” And even with the engaging trio of Rudd, Lilly and Douglass again in place, the dynamic has changed, with Scott and Hope comfortably in a relationship and Hank (mostly) no longer giving Scott a hard time. There isn’t as much of a spark now. Lastly, Pfeiffer’s Janet is almost as key to the proceedings as Scott, with the veteran actress seemingly dusting off a few of her moves from her turn as Catwoman in 1992’s “Batman Returns.” She really gets in on the action here, which is cool to see. Franchise director Peyton Reed is at the helm again, so “Quantumania” does at times have that comfy old feel, including in the opening minutes. This is when we catch back up with Scott, an Avenger who has written a book — “Look out for the Little Guy,” about his sizable role in saving the universe — and is working on accepting just how strange his life has become. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is a wild ride that will be more to some tastes than others. On the one hand, it boasts a pretty traditional villain — when Kang wears his highly technologically advanced suit, he is a virtually unstoppable force — and on the other introduces a blob named Veb (voiced by David Dastmalchian), who’s a little too interested in how many “holes” Scott has and whose “ooze” aids in language translation. If you are deeply invested in the increasingly weird goings-on in the MCU, be aware you may want to stay for both the mid- and post-credits scenes. (Let’s just say the Kangs all here.) The MCU probably is about to get even crazier, with a coming multiversal war eventually leading to the announced “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty” and “Avengers: Secret Wars,” on the books for 2025 and ’26, respectively."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn’t hate it, I didn’t love it, it was kind of middle of the road for me.
"
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall for me it was a visual spectacle, but... I was slightly underwhelmed about things."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Time to set your phasers to “5” Marvel Fans, and hope for better days ahead. Because Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania is a messy, lackluster kick-off to the new stage. After the prologue and before the two end stingers, Quantumania is bookended by two winning sequences, both set to the theme from “Welcome Back, Kotter.” They’re self-effacing and full of the unique charm that has defined Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man/Scott Lang character since the first installment. And the rest of the film can never quite measure up. While Scott has been off Avenging, his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has grown into an impressive young scientist herself. In fact, the new sub-atomic telescope she invented seems pretty nifty, until a family pizza party ends with Scott, Cassie, Hope/Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) all sucked back into the Quantum Realm. And it turns out, there’s plenty Janet didn’t let on about the 30 years she spent down there. Some of it involves Krylar (Bill Murray, channeling Criswell). But the life-threatening details revolve around how Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) wound up there, and why he must never make his way out. Director Peyton Reed returns from parts 1 and 2, but his powers are more limited in the quantum realm than Kang’s. Without city landmarks and average Joes to ground the comedy, the Ant-Man dorkishness falls flat.  The writing doesn’t help, although it’s tough to blame series newcomer  Jeff Loveness in his feature debut. The first film was written by Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish and Adam McKay, for Pete’s sake.  But Loveness cannot find a groove, throwing comedy bits that suit Aqua Teen Hunger Force into hyper-serious melodrama with a Barbarella backdrop. Much of the film is blatantly Star Wars, with attempts at Ragnorak humor that run headlong into extended exposition and Kang’s quest for dominating multiple plexes. None of it works. Rudd’s a doll, per usual, and Newton’s a charmer. Pfeiffer continues to have charisma to burn, which is a good thing because Lilly’s as engaging as a paper sack and Douglas is mainly wasted. But the real pity is Majors, another profound talent floundering in an underwritten villain role that relies on speechifying rather than acting.  There are some big ideas here, and the attempts at world building are ambitiously borrowed, but much the same as its unlikely Avenger, Quantumania comes up small."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,Quantumania is proof&#44; if we still needed it&#44; that bigger isn&apos;t always better&#46; In growing to typical Marvel size&#44; it shrinks away the fun&#46;
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantumania starts out on a messy note&#46; The story and VFX are all over the place until Kang enters the picture&#46; His haunting presence allows the film to find focus and become more entertaining&#46; The third act is much better&#44; and the humor mostly works&#46;
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," The 2015 release of Peyton Reed’s Ant-Man may have been the last time the Marvel Cinematic Universe felt like a scrappy upstart. Edgar Wright’s departure from the project was surprising in part because Marvel Studios was still touting the idea that its success came from picking the right directors and letting them do what they wanted — even if they wanted to pick a more obscure hero to focus on, and even if they wanted to make a film that didn’t have to be a world-beating blockbuster and could just be fun, weird, and anti-establishment.  The previous franchise installment, just a few months earlier, was Joss Whedon’s heady Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the idea that Marvel would follow up with a movie about the guy who talks to ants seemed too bizarre to be corporate. Marvel further brought home the idea of a “little” MCU movie with a slew of cute, viral marketing gimmicks, and the cherry on top was the original Ant-Man “teaser trailer,” billed at the time as the first Ant-Man footage.  But that was eight years ago. In 2023, there are no parts of the Marvel Cinematic Universe small enough to be overlooked. The third movie in the Ant-Man subseries, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, is also the first step in a three-year saga. The “little” MCU franchise has been saddled with introducing the load-bearing narrative pillar for the next two phases of the MCU. And in this fight between Ant-Man and Kang the Conqueror, we’re all losing.  Quantumania begins with cheery narration from the peppy, slightly dim version of Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man (Rudd), that Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp fans will find familiar. Scott has finally been reunited with his girlfriend, kick-butt tech CEO Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly); her parents, Hank (Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), the latter of whom was rescued from the Quantum Realm in 2018’s Ant-Man and the Wasp; and his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). (The latter aged to teenagehood while he was stuck beyond time and Hope, Hank, and Janet were all Blipped out of existence due to the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.) Scott is sad that he missed so much of Cassie’s childhood, but otherwise, his life is great. He’s a famous superhero with a close and loving family, and he just saved the world. His memoir about his own heroism is a feel-good bestseller.  Then, quick as whiplash, Janet’s past is called into question, an experiment goes awry, and everyone gets trapped in the Quantum Realm (again), where Kang seems to have already conquered. Like Ant-Man, the Quantum Realm has evolved as needed by the MCU. Once a void between elemental particles from which no one had ever returned, it became a time-travel McGuffin, and now it’s an entire fantasy adventure universe that exists within the microscopic spaces of our own.  This is a comic concept that has never made any goddamn sense and never will, and therefore remains a reliable vehicle for fun. The Quantum Realm should be the star of Quantumania. Instead, it sums up everything wrong with the movie.  The film’s world-building is more like world-edificing, the narrative equivalent of building a Hollywood set where the buildings are all flat wooden facades with no interiors. The Quantum Realm needs some people, because if Kang is a conqueror, he needs some people to conquer. Those people need attributes. But screenwriter ​​Jeff Loveness never threads all those details into more than a jokey callback. To be a conqueror, Kang needs an army, and Loveness and returning director Peyton Reed craft a fully faceless, interchangeable legion of… It isn’t clear whether they’re living beings from the Quantum Realm or some kind of robots.  Reed takes pains to make everything in Quantumania’s Quantum Realm as unfamiliar as possible, packing the screen with all-CGI characters, impossible vistas, and digital creatures. Conceptually, you can’t fault him for trying, but it seems that quantity won out over quality in distracting ways. In spite of the seven digital-effects studios listed in the credits, the effects often look unfinished.  But the real drawback of sending Ant-Man to a fantasy environment is that — as we have known since Honey, I Shrunk the Kids — the appeal of shrinking hijinks lies in seeing familiar things from a new perspective. Previous Ant-Man movies have played delightful havoc with scale, with Hank Pym’s shrinking-and-supersizing technology being used to create Hot Wheels carriers full of real cars, salt cellars the size of fire hydrants, and a dog-sized ant that plays drums. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has virtually none of this kind of toying with scale.  Worse, between horizonless skies that look like the textured walls of vast caves and a distinct lack of establishing and wide shots, the space the actors occupy in Quantumania — from their immediate surroundings to the very geography of the land they inhabit — is unreadable. All too often, the only way to tell if characters in a given shot are larger or smaller than “normal” isn’t any visual evidence, but the way they’re talking out loud about how they’re so big right now.  While visual scale clues can make a movie sing, they usually aren’t make-or-break. But this is an Ant-Man flick. If we can’t tell how big or small something is, what are we even doing here?  Unmistakable cracks in the visual effects could be ignored if Quantumania wasn’t leaning so hard into visual spectacle as one of its main features. The film’s chaotic design would function cleanly if the movie’s pace wasn’t so breakneck, if there was more space to explore the Quantum characters and their world, if the main cast was allowed time to just be people every now and then. And if the story was clunky but the look of the movie was confident, assured, and engaging, there would be something to write home about. But in trying to do everything with Quantumania’s story, screen effects, and setting, Reed doesn’t create much of anything.  That includes what has been touted as a must-see big moment for Jonathan Majors and his Kang the Conqueror, briefly introduced as the enigmatic “He Who Remains” in the first season of Loki on Disney Plus. Majors is a solemn on-screen presence. The vertical face “seams” of Jack Kirby’s original character design have been interpreted here as facial scarification, a striking choice that makes Kang look a little like he has tear tracks running down his face at all times. Majors’ committed delivery of unflappable villain bombast feels equal to the Thanos-level threat he’s supposed to be. Unfortunately, his grandiosity and the need to establish him as dangerous enough to carry two entire Marvel Phases pretty much nixes the Ant-Man franchise’s brand of back-and-forth comedy.  The last time the MCU had to truly debut a franchise-wide big bad, Guardians of the Galaxy used Ronan the Accuser — played with full-camp knowingness by Lee Pace — as an intermediary between the Guardians’ wisecracking fuck-ups and the impassive, unstoppable Thanos, preserving the tone of the former and the dignity of the latter. Quantumania ultimately serves neither Ant-Man nor Kang by pitting them against each other, going for big and small at the same time. The thing is, if you’re big from one perspective and small from another, you’re just normal-sized. And that’s the last thing an Ant-Man should be. "
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," No os voy a engañar: salvo algunos momentos sueltos dispersados a lo largo de siete películas, nueve series y dos especiales, la fase 4 supuso un desierto particular en mi relación con Marvel. Me fascinaron los brillantes primeros tramos de 'Bruja Escarlata y Visión', 'Ojo de Halcón' o 'Shang-Chi', pero más allá de esos oasis nada terminaba de encajar del todo, incluso en cintas que de primeras me entusiasmaron (podéis leer mi muy entusiasta crítica de 'Thor: Love and Thunder' cuya opinión se fue apagando poco después de escribirla) y el tiempo ha puesto en su lugar. Marvel se sentía sin nada que contar, como si después de 'Vengadores: Endgame' el chicle, antaño repleto de sabores, se hubiera quedado gomoso y sin sabor. Por suerte, la Fase 5 parece que viene dispuesta a enmendar sus errores... antes de que sea demasiado tarde. Hasta ahora, las películas de 'Ant-man' iban acordes con su personalidad y su tamaño: unas obras pequeñas dentro del organigrama marvelita que nadie se tomaba en serio. Al fin y al cabo, no dejaba de ser la saga de un tío que habla con las hormigas. Personalmente, disfruté ambas como un caramelito, un paréntesis dentro de la ultraépica continua. Y por eso los tráilers de 'Ant-man y la Avispa: Quantumania' me daban tanto terror: parecía como si las particulas Pym hubieran hecho crecer artificialmente al personaje en intenciones y tamaño, dándole más de lo que podía abarcar. Por suerte, estaba más que equivocado. A medio camino entre la space opera y el cómic moderno de superhéroes, 'Quantumania' pone todo su esfuerzo en ser abrumadoramente entretenida, pero sin dejar en ningún momento de mirar al largo plazo y pavimentar el camino hacia el futuro de la Fase 5. Esto lleva a que, en algunos momentos, Kang tenga que pararse a explicar la trama, pero es un mal necesario que nunca rompe el ritmo y que le hace mucho más interesante que tu villano Marvel estándar. Si en las próximas películas no tuercen el rumbo o abusan de él, veo posible llegar a las entregas de 'Vengadores' con más ilusión que mercadotecnia. Kevin Feige es consciente de que una de las cosas que más se le ha echado en cara a la Marvel de los últimos años ha sido que, después de Thanos, solo pasaban cosas, sin una meta a la que llegar o un gran objetivo que lo englobase todo. Con la llegada de los multiversos y Kang todo vuelve a cobrar un sentido: vuelve a ser una serie en la que perderse un capítulo puede ser vital para la trama, y no el procedimental al que nos han acostumbrado. El inicio de la Fase 5 tiene olor y sabor a Fase 3, y eso es muy, muy bueno. Una de las mayores sorpresas que guarda en su interior 'Quantumania' es su uso absolutamente desbordante de la imaginación y del color, más deudora de 'Flash Gordon' que de los propios cómics Marvel en los que se basa. Criaturas originales van pasando por la pantalla con diseños carismáticos y apabullantes, personalidad propia y ciertos chascarrillos que harán a algunos torcer el gesto, como olvidándose de que están viendo una película del Hombre Hormiga. Los tráilers prometían una película épica y regia, rompiendo por completo con la saga a la que pertenece, pero era imposible que una aventura de Scott Lang no tuviera su base en el sentido del humor, más como una presencia que sobrevuela toda la cinta e impide que nada se tome muy en serio que como gags específicos. De hecho, han alcanzado un punto de encuentro entre los que le dieron un sonado varapalo a los chistes de 'Thor: Love and Thunder' y los que exigen que se diferencie de DC en su tono liviano. No hay tantos chistes como en otras películas, pero los que hay, funcionan y no se hacen cargantes en absoluto. En su intento por ser diferente a todo lo que esperamos, es cierto que 'Quantumania' comete un error grave: traer a la vida a MODOK, un personaje que funciona bien en cómics y animación, pero que llevado a la acción real es, al menos cuando se quita la máscara, demasiado grotesco, formando parte inmediata del valle inquietante. Su utilización como secundario cómico no funciona en ningún momento y su arco resulta poco convincente, con un final imposible. La película ya tiene suficientes puntos diferenciales con otras cintas de superhéroes y su supervillano es muy carismático: la presencia de MODOK es molesta y da la sensación de trabajo no conseguido. De hecho, se puede calificar sin problema como ""desastre"". Por suerte, la película tiene claro lo que es y lo que quiere ser, y sabe sortear este bache con cierto estilo. Hay quien metería en la categoría de desastre a los efectos visuales, que en los tráilers recordaban a 'Spy Kids', pero, salvo algunos planos concretos, no parece que haya una pantalla verde tras los personajes. Cierto es que, al transcurrir toda ella en un paraje creado por CGI, nada va a resultar plenamente normal, pero han solucionado la papeleta de forma bastante solvente. Puede que no sea Pandora, pero tampoco es un set de rodaje. No todo el tiempo, al menos. Ante todo, 'Quantumania' vive por y para la aventura, algo que se había perdido en anteriores cintas del Universo Marvel. Va al grano (en el minuto diez ya están metidos de pleno en la trama principal), no teme crear grandes set pieces por ridículas que estas parezcan sobre el papel y nunca deja a sus personajes quietos: siempre están pasando cosas, descubriendo partes del pasado, luchando contra extraños enemigos o escapando. Es más: en el primer momento que se quedan quietos, aparece Bill Murray para alegrar el cotarro. No se puede tener más sentido de la diversión. Nadie va a ver la trigesimoprimera película de Marvel esperando arte y ensayo, pero es de agradecer que, además de poner rumbo fijo y ser brutalmente entretenida, se preocupe en hacer crecer a los personajes, especialmente Hope, cuyo pasado en el Reino Cuántico podemos explorar por fin, y Cassie, que finalmente se convierte en una superheroína por derecho propio. Incluso los deus ex machina (que haberlos, haylos) se van plantando a lo largo del metraje para que todo tenga unión y no se sienta deshilvanado. Ya tendremos tiempo de debatir sobre el final, las oportunidades perdidas de Marvel, y las dos postcréditos que, al menos, muestran una labor de redención y escucha al fandom. Aunque en su última recta peca de ser mucho más convencional de lo que presume en los otros dos actos, 'Quantumania' es colorida, original, diferente y enmienda los errores que ha cometido Marvel durante estos tres años de experimentación. Ahora solo falta comprobar si el tan ansiado público sigue esperando o ya se ha dado por vencido."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," El alivio cómico quería ser algo más. así lo explicó Peyton Reed hablando de Ant-Man y la Avispa: Quantumanía. El director (al que esta saga, recordemos, le llegó de segunda mano) estaba cansado de que sus cintas hicieran el papel de sorbetes para limpiarse el paladar entre tanto crossover épico, con lo que su nueva aspiración era convertir al héroe metepatas de Paul Rudd en anfitrión del nuevo gran evento Marvel. Los crímenes de poca monta, los problemas domésticos y las hormigas bautizadas en honor de actores malagueños tenían que despedirse, porque Reed y el guionista Jeff Loveness (Rick y Morty) tenían los ojos puestos en algo más. Algo cuyo precio, según vemos aquí, era el encanto que destilaban las aventuras de Scott Lang gracias, precisamente, a ser la única franquicia del estudio con la mirada puesta en las cosas pequeñas. Tras despachar un prólogo cuyo costumbrismo socarrón enlaza con las entregas anteriores, Quantumanía se esfuerza por ser tan grande como el protagonista cuando usa uno de sus discos azules. ¿Lo consigue? Pues no demasiado: la escala está ahí, con ese Reino Cuántico lleno de tentaciones psicodélicas, y también los materiales, empezando por ese Kang que siempre ha sido uno de los villanos más malos y más locos de Marvel en papel y que aquí aparece envuelto en el carisma de Jonathan Majors. Asimismo, la cinta también prometía darle más protagonismo a Michelle Pfeiffer como la Avispa original, revelando los secretos (no solo de alcoba, aunque también) de su exilio en esta dimensión subatómica. Muy a pesar de todo esto, sin embargo, uno se levanta de la butaca con esa sensación que dejan las películas incapaces de aprovechar sus potencial. La majestad del mundo paralelo, para empezar, se va rápidamente al garete debido a una cámara que no cumple (la agobiante insistencia en los primeros planos hace preguntarse cuánto tiempo han pasado los actores en el mismo plató) y a ese montaje cuya velocidad reduce cada momento prodigioso a un mero ‘visto y no visto’. Si el guion acompañara, al menos, estos defectos serían aguantables, pero un espectador con olfato para el cliché empezará a arrugar la nariz con la aparición, o más bien cameo de lujo, de un Bill Murray con maneras de Lando Calrissian: los peores momentos de Quantumanía, de hecho,  parecen armados a medias con piezas sueltas de Star Wars, y a medias con ideas desechadas por James Gunn para sus películas sobre los Guardianes de la Galaxia. Ante ese panorama, detalles como la aparición de un MODOK (Corey Stoll) tan grotesco como el de las viñetas (aunque no tanto como el de la serie de Patton Oswalt: ojalá) o esa escena en la que Rudd sirve como enxaneta de un castillo humano formado por todas sus identidades posibles saben a premios de consolación, porque ellas tampoco llevan sus premisas tan lejos como deberían. Así pues, Quantumanía refuerza la impresión de que Marvel lleva desde 2019 (cuando Vengadores: Endgame despidió su primera etapa) pugnando sin éxito para redefinir su marca sin perder el favor del gran público. Será que en el mundo actual resulta más y más difícil creer en los héroes, o que la Casa de las Ideas está dejando de hacer honor a su nombre. Puede que ambas cosas. Convertido por fin en superhéroe de pleno derecho, Scott Lang se enfrenta junto a su familia a los cabos sueltos que Janet dejó durante su exilio en el Reino Cuántico.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," Culture Representation: Taking place in an underworld universe called Quantumania, and briefly in San Francisco, the sci-fi/fantasy/action film “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” (based on Marvel Comics characters) features a cast of predominantly white characters (with some African Americans, Asians and Latinos) representing superheroes, regular humans and alien creatures. Culture Clash: Scott Lang (also known as superhero Ant-Man), his formerly estranged daughter Cassie Lang, Scott’s girlfriend Hope Van Dyne (also known as superhero The Wasp) and Hope’s parents get dragged into the Quantum Realm, where they have to battle evil forces, led by Kang the Conqueror.  Culture Audience: Besides appealing to the obvious target audience of Marvel movie fans, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” will appeal primarily to people who are fans of the movie’s headliners and superhero movies that are very predictable, corny and formulaic. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is a quantum mess. It’s bad enough that it recycles tired clichés of Marvel movies. This uneven superhero movie also rips off 1977’s “Star Wars” in many ways. Jonathan Majors’ standout performance can’t save this substandard spectacle. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is supposed to be the start of Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The movie will no doubt make blockbuster money, as all MCU movies have done so far. But in terms of creativity, this disappointing film is a stumble right out of the gate for the MCU’s Phase 5. One of the biggest problems with “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is how it awkwardly balances comedy with action. The jokes are the most juvenile, tackiest and least funny so far in the “Ant-Man” movie series, which began with 2015’s “Ant-Man” and continued with 2018’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp.” Peyton Reed is the director of all three movies, which makes his creative choices even more baffling for “Quantumania,” which has a drastically different tone (and lower quality as a result) than the first two “Ant-Man” movies.  When writer/director Taika Waititi directed 2017’s “Thor: Ragnarok” (the third “Thor” movie of the MCU), he radically changed the tone of the “Thor” movie series to make it fit his signature comedic style: goofy and slightly offbeat. Waititi did the same for 2022’s “Thor: Love and Thunder,” to less well-received results. But it doesn’t explain why the third “Ant-Man” movie has gone so far off-course when it’s had the same director for the first three “Ant-Man” movies. Much of the blame for why “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” has turned into a hodgepodge of bad jokes, sci-fi rehashes and superhero triteness has to with the movie’s screenplay, which is the feature-film debut of Jeff Loveness. Loveness’ previous writing experience is for shows such as the Adult Swim animated series “Rick and Morty,” the ABC variety talk show “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” the 2012 Primetime Emmy Awards, the 2016 Primetime Emmy Awards and the 2017 Academy Awards, with these particular award shows all hosted by Jimmy Kimmel. All of these TV shows require a different skill set than what’s required to write an entertaining superhero movie. Unfortunately, hiring a TV writer with no experience in writing movies turned out to be a huge mistake for “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” and Marvel Studios. In “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” the story begins right after the events of 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame.” Scott Lang (played by Paul Rudd), a former petty criminal also known as Ant-Man (whose superpower is being able to change the height of his body by wearing a special superhero suit), is a happily retired superhero living in his hometown in San Francisco. Scott has cashed in on his superhero fame by writing a memoir titled “Look Out for the Little Guy!,” where he talks about his superhero experiences and what they have taught him about life.  The movie shows Scott reading excerpts from his book at a book signing, but a few people there still mistake him for the more famous Spider-Man. Scott tells the small audience at this book signing, “From now on, the only job I want is to be a dad.” However, the movie unrealistically shows that middle-aged Scott, in his superhero “retirement,” has chosen to take a low-paying job as a customer service employee at a local Baskin-Robbins store. He has been named Employee of the Century because of his celebrity status as Ant-Man. It’s really the movie’s obvious brand placement for Baskin-Robbins, but viewers are given the weak explanation that Scott took the job because he loves ice cream. It all looks very awkward and fake. The movie’s overload of Baskin-Robbins brand promotion is extremely annoying. There’s even a scene where a Scott Lang look-alike named Jack, who’s a Baskin-Robbins employee, gets in on the fight action. It’s all so crass and stupid. Get used to seeing a lot of “look-alikes” in this movie, because much of it takes place in an alternate universe where clones of people and clones of creatures can show up randomly. Scott is trying to reconnect with his 18-year-old daughter Cassandra “Cassie” Lang (played by Kathryn Newton), who was raised primarily by Scott’s ex-wife while Scott was off doing other things, such as being a criminal-turned-superhero. Cassie has turned into a social justice warrior who’s involved in civil protests.  In the beginning of the movie, Cassie has landed in the San Francisco County Jail, because she was arrested for shrinking a police car because the police were trying to clear out an illegal homeless camp. Scott and his intelligent and sassy girlfriend Hope Van Dyne (played by Evangeline Lilly), also known as superhero The Wasp (she can turn into a wasp mutant and can also shrink her body height), have arrived at the jail to retrieve Cassie. It’s how Scott finds out to his dismay that Cassie is also an aspiring scientist who invented her own shrinkage suit. She hasn’t given herself a superhero name though. Scott thinks Cassie is too young to get involved in superhero antics. Cassie thinks Scott has become too complacent and thinks he should care more about making the world a better place. Hope and Cassie have bonded with each other because Hope is now the leader of the Pym Van Dyne Foundation, which uses Pym Particle (the body morphing invention used by Ant-Man and The Wasp) for humanitarian causes. Of course, it’s already been revealed in the “Quantumania” trailer that Scott will literally be sucked back into superhero activities, whether he likes it or not. Hope’s parents are scientists Hank Pym (played by Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (played by Michelle Pfeiffer), who were the original Ant-Man and The Wasp. As the movie over-explains and over-repeats in pedestrian dialogue, Janet was trapped in an alternative universe called the Quantum Realm for 30 years and doesn’t like to talk about what she experienced there. Janet returned to Earth when Hank rescued her from the Quantum Realm, as shown in “Ant-Man and the Wasp.” However, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” makes a big misstep by giving away in an opening scene that Janet actually was acquainted with the movie’s chief villain: Kang the Conequeror (played by Majors) while she was in the Quantum Realm, where Janet and Kang are seen escaping an attack from a giant insect-like creature. The movie should have left it a mystery until the right moment to show that Janet already knew this villain. Instead, this part of the plot is revealed too early in the film. At any rate, Scott finds out that Hank, Janet, Hope and Cassie have been studying ant science. Hope and Cassie in particular want to use this science to explore the Quantum Realm, but Janet has no interest in going back there. Janet won’t say why, but she will eventually make a confession later in the movie. Janet describes the Quantum Realm as a “place with no time and space. It’s a secret universe beneath ours.” To Janet’s horror, Cassie announces to Janet, Scott, Hank and Hope (while they are all in the scientific lab) that Cassie has been secretly sending signals to the Quantum Realm. Janet frantically tries to turn off the signal machine. Janet, Hank and Hope spend much of their time talking in vague tones about a mysterious “he” and “him” leader who has wreaked havoc on the Quantum Realm. Anyone can easily figure out that the “he” and “him” is Kang the Conqueror. There’s no reason to make him sound like “Harry Potter” villain Voldemort, also known in the “Harry Potter” series as He Who Shall Not Be Named. It’s yet another way that  “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” takes ideas from other sci-fi/fantasy franchises. Reed says in the production notes for “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” where he got some of the visual influences for the movie: “We pulled together a lot of visual inspiration—everything from electron microscope photography to heavy metal magazine images from the ’70s and ’80s. I collected all of these images from old science-fiction paperback book covers—artists like John Harris, Paul Laird, Richard M. Powers. Those paintings were evocative and really moody. We liked that feel and tone for the look of the Quantum Realm.” Reed curiously didn’t mention “Star Wars,” which is undoubtedly the biggest influence on “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” The Quantum Realm’s terrain looks like a desert in some areas and looks like a crater-filled planet in other areas. The desert scenes look too much like the desert realm of Tatooine in “Star Wars,” while the hooded costumes worn by the Quantum Realm residents look an awful lot like the costumes worn by Tusken Raiders from “Star Wars.” And if the “Star Wars” similarities for the production design and costume design weren’t enough, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” also imitates the Mos Eisley cantina scene in “Star Wars,” but doesn’t make it nearly as fun and interesting to watch. Hank, Janet and Hope end up in a place called Axia Restaurant, which is basically a “Star Wars” cantina look-alike filled with unusual-looking creatures. There’s no memorable music at the Axia Restaurant, like there was in the Mos Eisley cantina. Christophe Beck’s musical score for “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is serviceable and unremarkable. It’s at Axia Restaurant where Hope and Hank meet the smirking Lord Kylar (played by Bill Murray) for the first time. Janet already knows Lord Kylar, who says he is neither a human nor a machine. Lord Kylar, who is the governor of the Axia community, hints that he and Janet used to be lovers when she was in the Quantum Realm.  “I had needs,” Janet tells Hank and Hope in a somewhat defensive and uncomfortable tone. Hope then has to hear Hank talk about an ex-girlfriend. And she acts like a prudish teen who doesn’t want to think about her parents having love lives before they met each other. This is the type of time-wasting dialogue that’s supposed to pass as “comedy” in the movie.  As for the other inhabitants of the Quantum Realm, it’s a random mix of beings who look like humans and those who are very non-human in appearance, including a lot of jellyfish-like creatures that float around in space. As soon as Scott and Cassie arrive in the Quantum Realm, they are force-fed a red ooze by a creature named Veb (voiced by David Dastmalchian), because this red ooze will help these humans understand the language of the Quantum Realm residents. Dastmalchian had the role of Kurt (a member of Scott’s posse) in the first two “Ant-Man” movies. Veb is an underdeveloped character that is meant to be comedic, but Veb’s jokes fall very flat. The Quantum Realm residents predictably greet these newcomers from Earth with reactions that range from curiosity to hostility. Jentorra (played by Katy O’Brian) is an anti-Kang freedom fighter who scowls a lot and has to learn to trust these Earth heroes to be her allies. Xolum (played by James Cutler, also known as Jamie Andrew Cutler) is a loyal soldier and totally generic sidekick of Jentorra.  Quaz (played by William Jackson Harper) is a psychic/telepath, whose only purpose in the movie is to make people uncomfortable by reading their thoughts and saying their thoughts out loud. His revelations are supposed to be amusing, but they’re not really all that funny. Randall Park has a small and non-essential role as FBI agent Jimmy Woo.  Corey Stoll returns as “Ant-Man” villain Darren Cross, also known as Yellowjacket, who has now been shrunken by Kang into a subatomic lackey with an oversized head known as M.O.D.O.K., which stands for Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing. M.O.D.O.K. looks like a floating head and delivers some of the few genuinely comedic moments in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Various characters in the movie have horrified reactions to seeing Darren look so drastically different as M.O.D.O.K., but this gag is repeated too much and loses its impact by the middle of the movie. As for Kang, Majors’ performance is the only one that brings a certain gravitas to the rampant foolishness and smarm that stink up “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Majors brings a combination of menace and melancholy to his role, but it’s wasted in a movie that is hell-bent on trying to be more like Waititi’s “Thor” movies. The rest of the cast members’ performances aren’t bad, but they’re not special either. Kang’s soldiers are Quantumnauts, which are as anonymous and soulless as the mostly CGI creations that they are. Unfortunately, the big showdown fight scene is lot more montonous and unimaginative than it should have been. It ends abruptly and in a way that has been done already (and done much better) in many other sci-fi/fantasy/action movies. As for the movie’s visual effects, it’s a shame that a movie with this big budget can make visual effects look so cheap and shoddy. There are scenes that make it obvious where the “blue screens” and “green screens” were. A mid-credits scene and end-credits scene basically show the return of a major character from the movie. The end-credits scene is a nod to the Disney+ series “Loki.” As an example of how “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” has a sitcom tone to it, the movie uses John Sebastian’s 1976 hit “Welcome Back” (the theme from the sitcom “Welcome Back, Kotter”) as bookends to the movie. A big-budget superhero movie should not look like a second-rate sitcom, which is what “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” has turned out to be."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,Though the stakes feel lackluster&#44; and Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania trudges along at times rather than galloping at a clip&#44; Marvel&#8217;s goodwill might make the film worthwhile&#46;
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," After an incredibly disjointed Phase Four, all eyes are indeed on Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (or Quantumania, as we will be noting for short throughout this review) to see how this particular threequel will set a precedent for the forthcoming Phase Five of the continued Marvel Cinematic Universe. Whilst there’s a certain vibrancy and scrappiness to Quantumania that brings to mind temperaments not unlike the atmosphere of classic Star Wars or the Guardians of the Galaxy films, Peyton Reed‘s third go-around with “the little guy”, Paul Rudd‘s always charming Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man, feels unsure of its own journey, losing its personality in a sea of overt CGI and poorly-executed humour that, sadly, cheapens whatever genuine wit Jeff Loveness‘s script manages to occasionally muster. Basking in the afterglow of saving the world, Scott happily skips about his day amongst the appreciative crowds of San Francisco; even if the local coffee shop owner refers to him as “Spider-Man” whenever he thanks him.  His romance with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), now overseeing the use of Pym Particles in her efforts to benefit humanity, is the picture of bliss, and he’s even written a best-selling book, waxing lyrical about looking out for the aforementioned little guy.  It’s a harmless, easy life for a supposed super-hero. A Lang who is actually hoping to be heroic is his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton, taking over from Emma Fuhrmann’s brief turn in Endgame), who after informing her somewhat clueless father that she’s served some serious minutes behind jail cell doors, reveals that she’s created a form of technology that allows her to communicate with the Quantum Realm, a miniscule dimension that can only be entered through subatomic particles; it also happens to be where Cassie’s unofficial grandmother – Hope’s mother – Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer, as captivating as ever) was stranded for 30-odd years, and has refused to divulge any concrete information about the realm itself. Janet is none too pleased that Cassie, Hope, and her husband, Hank (Michael Douglas), have meddled with such technology and demands that the communicative sector of Cassie’s creation be shut down.  And that would be all well and good if this wasn’t a damn Marvel movie, so, before you can say “CGI”, our blended family is sucked into the Quantum Realm, separated in the process as Scott and Cassie veer off into one micro-verse, and Janet, Hank and Hope to another. The Quantum Realm has always been a subject of fascination within the MCU, and given that their multi-verse narratives has given the studio license to play God with character canons, it makes sense that in further detailing the Quantum Realm they would embrace whatever weird and wonderful temperament may come with such an unexplored dimension.  Initially, Reed’s film – as heavily enforced by special effects as it is (not once do you believe you’re ever on a set of practicality) – delights in the bizarre plant life and various living organisms that inhabit the realm. It gets over the alternate language of the setting with an easy introduction of drinking a local beverage to begin understanding the surroundings, and in separating Scott and Cassie from Janet, Hank and Hope, it allows each respective dynamic to thrive more fully.  This is where Quantumania exercises the first of its two major plus points: it becomes a vehicle for Pfeiffer.  So unfairly side-lined in the last Ant-Man sequel, Ant-Man and the Wasp (despite that film having the smarts to base its entire plot around how far people would be willing to go to save Michelle Pfeiffer), her Janet proves to be the action-capable, dangerously-alluring character we always knew she was, but never had the chance to see. Her aloofness as to what she got up to when trapped there for 3 decades asked more questions than answers provided, and here, through the fear and anger of locals or the suggestive banter of Krylar (Bill Murray), she’s a picture painted with brutal strokes that are at odds with the loving wife and mother Hank and Hope know her as.  Whatever reputation Janet has in the Quantum Realm though is tied directly to Kang (Jonathan Majors), the film’s second plus point.  Kang, a conqueror, who is an alternate timeline variant of He Who Remains from the Loki television series, has a terrifying grace when flexing his evident villainy, and it’s the complexity of his character and relationship with Janet that serves him a stronger hand than other MCU adversaries are often afforded. As villains have so often been a hit-and-miss affair within the MCU across the multitude of films, it’s to Quantumania‘s benefit that it has Majors playing ball as much as he is.  Not only is he an exciting talent to watch unleash his charm and volatility across the screen, he elevates the film as a whole, as does Pfeiffer, as the other villain on hand is an embarrassment of riches that cheapens a former character and the actor playing him; Corey Stoll‘s take on M.O.D.O.K. leaving much(!) to be desired. It’s the off-setting of a character like M.O.D.O.K. to Kang that easily sums up Quantumania‘s overall temperament as a film; it’s loud and messy, just as it’s intriguing and unconventional.  It’s a shame that the messiness outweighs the intrigue though, as this start to Phase 5 doesn’t come with any clear kind of structure – only the mid and post-credit scenes alluding to who the big bad is going to be across the next line of films. Whilst I wouldn’t say I have Marvel fatigue, it’s clear that the studio has lost the sheen of its origins.  Hopefully learning that too much can sometimes be enough, Phase Five needs to streamline itself if it hopes to earn a degree of cohesion and, perhaps in that regard Quantumania can serve as a cautionary tale of what not to do.  Whatever the course of action, Majors is a key find in moving forward as a formidable villain for all to fear and, for the love of all that is good and holy, give Pfeiffer her own movie.  This was a good first step, but she – and her version of the original Wasp – deserve so much more. Film critic with a penchant for Dwayne Johnson, Jason Momoa, Michelle Pfeiffer and horror movies, harbouring the desire to be a face of entertainment news."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," ife is good for Scott Lang (Paul Rudd). Despite his storied past as a petty thief and burglar, he’s now world-renowned as the hero Ant-Man, a member of the Avengers, and most recently as the author of a successful autobiography. With the planet saved and steadily returning to normalcy, Lang’s primary focus reverts to repairing the strained relationship with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). Unfortunately, the rebellious activist doesn’t quite see him in the same idealistic light that the public does. When Cassie, with the guidance of Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), builds a device that can map areas of the Quantum Realm, the revolutionary telescope looks to be the catalyst that will bring father and daughter closer together. And it does, but with the unexpected result of pulling Cassie, Scott, Hank, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hope (Evangeline Lilly) into the subatomic world. When Scott and Cassie are captured by a group of freedom fighters led by Jentorra (Katy O’Brian), the duo are astounded by the appearance of sentient life in a zone that Janet claimed to be barren. But the existence of an eclectic variety of intelligent species wasn’t the only important revelation she concealed, as the band of lost travelers soon realize they are being hunted by both a mechanized killing machine (Corey Stoll) and a warlord (Jonathan Majors) hellbent on conquering not just the Quantum Realm, but every universe imaginable. “What is this place?” The Ant-Man household is exceptionally glib and casual when it comes to abusing their technology – perhaps a bit like Iron Man. There isn’t really anyone to rein them in, either, as the notable appearance of government goons from the Avengers films and, most recently, “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” aren’t anywhere to be found. This leads to a plot solely based around a careless accident, quite comparable to “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” in which a fouled-up spell sets in motion a series of catastrophes that would compose the entire picture. Here, Cassie’s meddling with the Quantum Realm is completely avoidable, especially if the Pym tech wasn’t so freely available to be toyed with. It’s particularly irking since the mishap is both stupid and exhaustively inexplicable. That, however, is how “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is designed. Since it’s set in a world thoroughly independent from the main timeline, everything conducted in the subatomic territory has no bearing on normal life. This allows for unlimited creativity, but also considerable meaninglessness; when nothing has genuine consequences for the cast, no incident possesses any weight. And that’s ultimately one of the primary problems with the Quantum Realm and the related Multiverse: everything can be undone or redefined when there aren’t any rules to begin with. “My life doesn’t really make sense.” As a result, the plot here is colossally trivial. On the creativity front, concepts range from borrowing from “The Lost Continent,” “Fantastic Voyage,” and “The Land that Time Forgot,” to lifting imagery from the “Star Wars” universe (and “Stargate” and “The Time Machine”), to reminding of the disaster that was “Strange World,” in which gooey, bubbly visual concoctions didn’t have to follow any sort of cohesion. Just as with the characters and their superpowers, which once again remain unspecified, the varied, diverse assortment of alien denizens establishes zero boundaries for what they can do or what is possible with their cities and weaponry and technology. A broccoli-headed humanoid could be the most powerful creature on the planet – or he could be utterly useless. A few designs are functional, but most exist simply to dazzle for the brief seconds they’re onscreen (again, quite a bit like attention-grabbing Star Wars creatures that walk past the frame). “What is he talking about?” Further hurting the sci-fi potential is exasperatingly uninspired dialogue; most conversations are merely the trading of tired cliches. And, as if becoming common in spectacle endeavors, the one character with all the answers refuses to divulge clues until nearly an hour into the running time, frustratingly withholding information by using the flimsy excuse of urgency in planning a rescue. Plenty of action and explosions occur in the interim, but they mean so very little when it’s unclear what exactly the heroes are fighting for/against and why. “I’m sorry I never told you.” It’s additionally disappointing when multiple roles spontaneously don costumes as if they materialized around them – somewhat like Superman in reverse, who tears away his work suit to reveal the colorful raiment that is always underneath. Can’t the villain simply be already wearing his intimidating uniform? And this new baddie is incredibly dull, considering that he is yet another in a long line of seemingly invincible, all-powerful, telekinesis-using super-beings with never-ending resources, armies of troopers, and the ability to shoot laser beams from his fingertips (laser beams that only cause damage to background characters). At one point, it’s crucial that he employ Ant-Man to do a specific job, but it’s unclear why he can’t just do it himself. But so much of the plot relies on that very notion: only one entity can accomplish a given task, and so a series of missions and goals is established. Or, a phrase like “probability storm” is tossed about, pretending to explain why something ludicrous is occurring. “Just be glad I need you.” Also difficult to digest is M.O.D.O.K., a character that might delight longtime Marvel fans, but will surely test the limits of what non-fans will accept. It doesn’t help that the film acknowledges just how silly this monstrosity is; he’s still included, and given an inordinate amount of screentime, nearly all of which involves poking fun at his appearance. Perhaps he sums up the predicament of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania”: it’s a wealth of visual chaos that hopes to distract from the absolutely nonsensical ideas. And it doesn’t help that the finale is a mess of repetitive standoffs, proving that no one is in any real trouble, while the closing sequences reiterate that this episode essentially exists just to introduce a new archenemy, a nemesis that will play a major part in the upcoming Avengers sequels.

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,A bit of severity does an Ant-Man good&#44; with &#8220;Quantumania&#8221; the best of the trilogy&#44; at least when it focuses on the multiverse doomsday scenario and not wackiness&#46;
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," The unspoken motto of the ""Ant-Man"" movies is ""think small,"" which has paradoxically made it stand apart from other sectors of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which tend towards the grandiose. ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" plays around with that idea by shrinking Ant-Man/Scott Lange (Paul Rudd) and the other major characters to a subatomic size ten minutes into the story and dispatching them to the Quantum Realm, which looks like James Cameron's Pandora reimagined as the cover of a 1970s jazz fusion album, and keeping them there for the rest of the film as they battle an exiled supervillain named Kang (Jonathan Majors). The result is simultaneously the biggest and smallest of the Ant-Man films, a neat trick.  Is it a must-see? No—the middle hour is fun in that patented easygoing ""Ant-Man"" way. Returning director Peyton Reed and screenwriter Jeff Loveness let the characters wander around the Quantum Realm, which is like a psychedelic sci-fi cartoon version of those jungles in 1930s serials where a clueless Western explorer would misinterpret a gesture and anger a local tribe, or get dunked in a river by an elephant, or be grossed out by the prospect of eating snake meat until they had a bite and realized it tastes kinda like chicken.  Here, the tribe includes a guy with a flashlight for a head and one with a transparent, gelatinous body who is obsessed with how many ""holes"" humans have (the comedic peak of Rudd's performance is the pause he takes while Scott counts in his head), and a telepath (William Jackson Harper) who is cursed to constantly hear the bizarre and/or filthy thoughts that race through others' minds. Instead of elephants, there are houses that look as if Fred Flintstone's home mated with the Pillsbury Dough Boy, and that are alive and can walk and defend themselves in war. There are also gelatinous bugs and other critters, shrubs and trees modeled on fungi and lichens, and a mitochondrial thing scaled like Godzilla.  They're all seemingly modeled on photos of ""small worlds"" of varying magnification levels. That the designers have grouped these microscopic and subatomic things because they're ""small"" is part of the fun. It's like something a kid threw together for a science fair, hoping that sheer charm would compensate for not having any actual science content. Too bad that, for all its amusing jokes, the world onscreen mostly looks like a Marvel screen-saver. Bill Pope, who shot the ""Matrix"" films and multiple Sam Raimi and Edgar Wright movies, is the cinematographer here, but not so you'd notice. There's not much for a cinematographer (or director—even Ryan Coogler has seemed tamped down by Marvel) to do to show individual personality on these projects when so much of the running time is pre-visualized by effects companies; and when Marvel studios boss Kevin Feige, who seems determined to keep art to a minimum for fear of gumming up the content machine, wields an aesthetic veto pen. As for Kang: he's what genre buffs call a ""ret-con."" The filmmakers need him to be a fearsome and all-powerful villain (he's essentially Thanos in a new wrapper: a genocidal madman) and to be introduced in this movie so that he could quickly be positioned as the Big Bad for the next Avengers team-up. But they also have to explain why Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), former wife of original Ant-Man Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), who was trapped in the Quantum Realm for 30 years, never mentioned Kang to anybody.  The answer is not persuasive, despite Pfeiffer selling the heck out of it. But this is a comic-book movie, so you have to roll with it. Pfeiffer, at least, gets a lot to do in pushing the plot forward and papering over cracks in the storytelling. Meanwhile, unfortunately, Evangeline Lilly's Hope, aka The Wasp, just seems to kind of be there. She's present and involved, but doesn't make much of an impression. (Narratively, of course, she's been eclipsed by Cassie: the last one was more the Pyms' movie, and this one's mainly about Scott and Cassie, who is now a teen with her own super-suit, and played by Kathryn Newton. But they still managed to give Michael Douglas plenty of good bits.) Kang is a poorly written character—he's bad, he's mad, he's a genius, he wants to escape the Quantum Realm, and that's pretty much it. There's only so much that the cast or filmmakers can do to make him seem terrifying. The film doesn't have the nerve (or perhaps the studio's permission?) to wipe the smile off the audience's face in the manner of, say, the last act of ""Avengers: Infinity War"" or the middle hour of ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" There's a brief scene where Kang convinces Scott to use his thief abilities to steal this movie's equivalent of the Ring of Power or Infinity Stone or Mother Box by threatening to murder Cassie in front of him, then make Scott re-experience her death for all eternity. But we know it’s not the sort of movie where that could ever happen, nor one where any major character we care about will suffer too greatly.  And so Kang's menace is conveyed through an uncharacteristically hammy performance by Majors. He seems to be channeling post-1970s Marlon Brando performances where Brando was being fed lines through an earpiece or reading them off notecards taped to other actors' costumes. Sometimes he'll pause forever between words in a line while staring ahead, or look up, or to the side, as if the next thought might be lurking there. Like Brando, he’s fussing around in ways that seem to work at cross-purposes with the movie, but it’s in service of trying to make something out of nothing. One element that does intrigue: Kang seems deeply, furiously sad, in a way that echoes one of the most powerful lines from ""The Sopranos,"" ""Depression is anger turned inward."" Eventually, the movie succumbs to the MCU formula and devotes its last act to a lot of overly busy CGI battles, with things crashing into other things and exploding and disintegrating while people yell about having to save the universe. Sometimes the movie overdoes the self-awareness in that unfortunate MCU way—such as by having a character confirm that a weird thing just happened by saying, ""That was weird,"" or announce that another character is cool, both of which happen here. But the film's low-stress, low-stakes attitude saves it.  Serenely untroubled by pressures to break box office records or win Oscars, the Ant-Man films seem content to be clever entertainments with heart, but not so much that they become cloying. From the size jokes to the running gags to the casting of Rudd, who has spent his career behaving as if he's a random regular guy who stumbled into stardom and finds it all quite silly, the series manages to be light but not inconsequential, whether a given scene is sentimental (anything involving Scott and Cassie) or cheerfully deranged (the climatic fight at the end of the first movie atop a Thomas the Tank Engine train set). Ant-Man is officially a member of the MCU's starting lineup, the Avengers, but feels like a replacement player who gets a text when Thor calls in sick. This new movie validates Scott's not-quite-insecurity (he's not deep enough to be existentially tormented) by having him get mistaken for other superheroes. He takes it in stride. Two films ago, he got fired from Baskin-Robbins, and before that, he was in jail. Happiness, like size, is a matter of perspective.

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,The best entry of the trilogy&#46; Higher stakes&#44; dangers and repercussions within the trippy Quantum Realm and for the rest of the MCU&#46; Jonathan Majors is fantastic as Kang&#44; the next big villain for Marvel&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,Some really great stuff here - especially in the first half - from Rudd&#44; Pfeiffer &amp; Majors&#46; But then the film totally falls apart&#44; crushed under the weight of being asked to do too much for the franchise&#46; It did make me want to buy Ant-Man&apos;s book&#46;&#46;&#46;
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is upon us with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. After the first Ant-Man film was released in 2015 as part of Phase 2, Paul Rudd’s titular character has continued to play a major role in the MCU, including providing the critical piece that allowed the Avengers to defeat Thanos in Avengers: Endgame. In what has to be at least a mild shock, Ant-Man ends up being only the fifth MCU franchise to get to a third film (Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Spider-Man being the other four). Considering the others are marquee characters in both comics and film, it’s no small accomplishment that a character that most casual audiences knew little about prior to the first film’s release has reached this milestone. With director Peyton Reed back at the helm for a third time, and largely the same cast as the previous films, Quantumania is a film that fans of the franchise will enjoy thanks to its trademark humor, unabashed weirdness and of course star Paul Rudd’s irresistible charisma. However, the film suffers from a desire to make the third movie a greater spectacle than its predecessors; in doing so, it loses some of its unique charm. Where the film falters, Jonathan Majors is there to lift it up with a genuinely fantastic performance as Kang. The next great Marvel villain has arrived, and somehow surpasses the hype. Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope’s parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott’s daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible. Directed by Peyton Reed and produced by Kevin Feige, p.g.a. and Stephen Broussard, p.g.a., “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” also stars Jonathan Majors as Kang, David Dastmalchian as Veb, Katy O’Brian as Jentorra, William Jackson Harper as Quaz and Bill Murray as Lord Krylar. The sci-fi adventure opens in theaters on Feb. 17, 2023.  Director Peyton Reed and star Paul Rudd deserve much of the credit for shepherding the Ant-Man franchise to great success. Everyone loves Rudd, and at the start of Quantumania, art imitates reality, as Scott Lang is the toast of the town. He’s an Avenger who saved the world; he’s a beloved celebrity who gets free food (with the benefit of a little arachnid mix-up); and he’s a successful author who inspires kids. The rest of the Ant clan are thriving as well, with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) running a successful corporation, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) trying to find some normalcy after being reunited, and Scott’s daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) exploring some rebellious heroism of her own. It all culminates in a wholesome family pizza dinner together. This joyful opening is one of the most fun parts of the film, as it allows Rudd to maximize his considerable charisma and self-deprecating humor, and also provides a fascinating glimpse into what the post-Avengers: Endgame world is like for our heroes. It’s also a rare moment of happiness and peace in a superhero story. By their nature, Marvel films are heavy on action, and especially lately, have quite a bit of loss and suffering. Coming off of Wakanda Forever, which might have been Marvel’s most emotionally heavy film ever, Quantumania is a pleasing change of pace. Of course, the tranquility doesn’t last, as it becomes clear that Lang isn’t merely enjoying the fruits of his labors, but hiding behind them to avoid more superhero responsibilities. Lang’s inner conflict is a welcome look inside the psyche of a hero who survived countless life-threatening and life-altering situations. Outside of Tony Stark in Iron Man 3 and Clint Barton in Hawkeye, the MCU hasn’t really considered much of how being a real world superhero would impact the very human characters in these stories. Lang isn’t visibly disturbed or upset, but he clearly isn’t thrilled to get back in the game any time soon. He doesn’t have much of a choice when Cassie reveals that she’s been experimenting with the Quantum Realm, which ultimately triggers an event that literally sucks the entire Ant-family into the bizarre world and takes them on an thrilling, but harrowing, action-adventure. Quantumania has several praiseworthy performances, starting with Rudd, who is predictably fantastic once again as Lang. With four Marvel films under his belt, Rudd is very comfortable in his superhero suit, and he exudes a calm assurance that audiences can feel. In addition to Rudd, newcomer Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang is a seamless addition to the MCU. Marvel took a risk, recasting Abby Ryder Fortson, who played a younger Cassie in Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Emma Fuhrmann, who played an older Cassie in Avengers: Endgame, but it looks to have paid off. All credit to both talented actors but Marvel clearly has a vision for a more experienced actor who can hold her own in the action sequences and likely fits into a larger plan going forward. Sure enough, it’s hard not to think about Cassie’s potential Young Avengers future as you watch this film. Newton has great chemistry with Rudd and the rest of the cast, and is remarkably able to avoid being overshadowed while sharing the screen with the likes of Rudd, Pfeiffer, Douglas and Jonathan Majors. Speaking of Majors, Quantumania is as much a spotlight of Majors’ Kang as it is a capping of a trilogy. First introduced as “He Who Remains” in Loki, Majors makes his highly anticipated return to the MCU as a fully realized Kang. He is fierce, evil and terrifying. Majors plays Kang with a brilliant mix of vulnerability, emotion and earned arrogance. His line delivery is exquisite, as nearly every line Kang says has an unmistakable weight. Upon first meeting Kang, Lang tries to intimidate him with bluster, saying that he’s made a mistake in capturing an Avenger. Kang is unmoved and ends their exchange declaring simply, “You’re out of your league…Ant-Man.” He’s right, and we may all be out of Majors’ league. Quantumania is worth watching even just for Kang, who commands every scene and leaves you wanting more (which we are clearly getting). It’s worth noting too that both Pfeiffer and Douglas get a significant amount of screen time and play critical roles in the story. The MCU and superhero films in general don’t often feature older characters, and it’s great to see the two veterans get the opportunity to prove that they can still carry action sequences. As any franchise progresses, there’s this inherent pressure to make the next film bigger. But bigger doesn’t always mean better. Nearly every trilogy suffers from the weight of that pressure and that goal is disappointingly apparent in Quantumania. After two films that made very amusing and creative use of having size-changing heroes in our world, Quantumania goes Fast & Furious big and dives head on into the Quantum Realm, which is where almost all of the story takes place. Unfortunately, having the film set in an overwhelmingly CGI setting strips the story of its unique appeal (watching tiny heroes run around in a familiar world), and also hamstrings some of Rudd’s charm. Lang is great fun interacting with both normal human characters and superhuman heroes because he’s so regular. There’s a reason that one of Scott Lang’s most memorable scenes involves him geeking out over meeting Steve Rogers in Captain America: Civil War. When you take Lang and his family away from the real world setting and dump them into a cosmic fantasy world that belongs in Star Wars or Dune, Lang feels out of place. To director Peyton Reed’s credit, Quantumania is extremely ambitious. He clearly wanted to make an Ant-Man film that is unlike either of its predecessors. However, much of how that ambitiousness undermined the film is symbolized in the character of MODOK. Admittedly, MODOK is a completely absurd character, but I actually thought that his design from the trailer was excellent. The potential was there. However, while Quantumania attempts to lean fully into the ridiculousness of MODOK, it doesn’t manage to find the necessary balance of humor and effectiveness. The result is eye-roll inducing, as is much of the film’s third act. Quantumania is disappointingly lacking in diversity and it is noticeable. Especially considering how wonderfully diverse Phase 4 of the MCU has been, Quantumania feels like a relic. In some ways it is, as the first Ant-Man film was released 8 years ago. Still, the franchise has had ample opportunity over the last two films to add diversity but failed to do so in meaningful ways, and has even taken a step back with the notable absence of some previously introduced characters. Thankfully, Jonathan Majors buoys both the film as a whole and the franchise’s lack of diversity. Majors is truly an artist, and writer Jeff Loveness’ script and Reed’s direction allow him to explore the character of Kang in ways that we don’t often see in villians. However, as incredible as Majors is, should the Ant-Man franchise continue, one can only hope that more diversity in front of, and behind, the camera is included.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,Now 31 films and five phases deep into the Marvel Cinematic Universe &#40;MCU&#41;&#44; and we&#8217;ve seemingly reached a new franchise low with Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania&#46;
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Fun MCU elements do exist between a father-daughter superhero bond and zany Quantum beings. Still, Reed generally does better marketing Marvel's future than delivering a thrilling, standalone adventure. Quantumania is a family affair. Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Scott Lang's (Paul Rudd) daughter, builds a subatomic gadget that can transmit signals to the Quantum Realm, with encouragement from Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). But when something goes wrong, they're all sucked into the Multiverse's basement. Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) thought she'd escaped, but now she's back in her decades-long prison. The problem is she didn't tell her family everything about the Quantum Realm — including the ruthless destroyer she accidentally helped empower then betrayed, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). Quantumania accomplishes the objective of hyping our excitement for future MCU properties. Kathryn Newton makes a splash as the yet-unnamed superhero version of Cassie Lang, who's at her best when proving her abilities to an overprotective yet proud Scott. Jonathan Majors is the resoundingly correct choice for Kang, laying dramatic imposition thick while displaying range that will come in handy down the road.  Reed and co-writer Jeff Loveness are tasked with using Ant-Man to introduce another Young Avenger along with the MCU's next multi-phase supervillain, which they do, but at a detriment to being a solo Ant-Man film. Especially crammed alongside Scott, Hank, Hope, Janet, an entire local Quantum rebellion, and — you guessed it — ants. There needs to be a stronger balance between the humor that follows Ant-Man and Quantumania's tenser narrative implications. Quintessential Ant-Man moments are hit-and-miss, like Scott's sitcom-y inner monologue scored to the Welcome Back, Kotter theme song (""Welcome Back"" by John Sebastian), or the abysmally failed experiment that is Corey Stoll's M.O.D.O.K (Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing). Bless Stoll's commitment, but M.O.D.O.K's unmasked appearance is unquestionably the worst Marvel eyesore to date, torpedoing any scene where he appears.  Reed struggles to channel his inner James Gunn when embracing the Quantum Realm's ""weirdness,"" outside an ooze man who loves talking about ""holes"" or Hank discussing ants in his kooky grandpa voice. What should shine a light on levity frequently lands flat between Kang's doomsday threats. Also frustrating is how, as an Ant Family movie, the core collective appears incomplete. Hope Van Dyne doesn't feel characterized enough beyond fulfilling a mother archetype for Cassie. Hank provides comedic relief and life-saving escapes, while Janet's withheld information always comes out when it's too late.  William Jackson Harper as the over-it telepath Quaz or Katy M. O'Brian as resistance leader Jentorra make more of an impression, but Quantumania falls victim to the MCU problem of stuffing too many characters into a single feature. Scott's ho-hum relationship with Hope pales compared to Scott's sweeter fatherly growth with Cassie, yet we're stuck splitting time because of the film's scope. Visual effects workloads for Quantumania are astounding but can also produce numbing results. Interstellar cosmos swirls, amorphous amoeba shapes and furious weather patterns combine to distinguish this Quantum Realm that always seems to be tearing apart yet seeps together like randomized sci-fi gruel. Colonies of settlers resembling geodes, broccoli or pink blobs attempt this melting-pot Star Wars population without the authenticity of Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy or The Mandalorian's civilizations. A cinematographer like Bill Pope is lost on the nondescript copy-and-paste tactics of Quantumania as Kang's soldiers fight rebel alliances photocopied across the screen. No matter how comic-book correct, there's a quantity over quality effect to the abundance of VFX. As an origin for new heroes and mighty villains, Quantumania establishes what the MCU requires. That said, there needs to be more connectivity as an Ant-Man sequel. Quantumania can't pass on Cosmic Marvel tapestries alone, especially when stretches of advanced green screen technology remind us actors are asked to perform against blank spaces and pixelated co-stars for long periods. Everything reads as James Gunn Lite, beholden to multi-film plot creation that supersedes a Quantum Realm uprising in the now. While brimming with imagination thanks to environmental Quantum designs, Quantumania doesn't escape feeling like a layover between major franchise destinations.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is fully committed to multiversal event storytelling intended to connect feature films with its streaming television shows. But, now we’ve reached the point of an entire cinematic adventure that serves as filler with the superhero solo outing called Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is making his way through life, trying to become a better father for his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). He wants to connect with her, but he hasn’t been around when she needed him most. Cassie isn’t a little girl any longer, proving she’s more like Scott than either of them realizes, as she finds herself getting in trouble with the law. Meanwhile, an unfortunate situation in the lab sends Scott and Cassie into the ever-dangerous Quantum Realm along with Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). However, the strange creatures and the politics of this strange world are the least of their concerns, as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) waits to complete his plan. Quite a bit has changed since 2018’s Ant-Man and the Wasp, all thanks to the events of 2019’s Avengers: Endgame. The effects of the Snap, also called the Blip, still loom over society. People disappeared from their loved ones for years, leaving others to wander the Earth feeling a void. Scott was previously lost in the Quantum Realm after the Snap left him without any help for quite some time, making Cassie think he also turned to dust. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania develops the bonds between parents and their children. Scott and Cassie remain at the core of Jeff Loveness’ screenplay, as they try to repair the damage their time apart caused. Meanwhile, Hope deals with her own difficulties with her mother, Janet, as their relationship mirrors Scott and Cassie’s in certain ways. All of the protagonists lost something monumental in their lives as a result of time, which is a form of currency that Kang understands all too well. All of the characters in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania have their flaws, but they’re trying their best to do what’s right. A running theme about trying to accomplish a feat that matters courses through the film’s veins. Hope finds new ways to make her mark on the world with how she utilizes Pym Particles, while Scott milks his Avengers fame to set an example and wants to prove that he’s not a failure of a father. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the third in Scott’s solo adventures outside of working with the Avengers. There’s a positive message surrounding his book called Look Out for the Little Guy, even despite its incredible heavy-handedness. From the dramatic plot beats to the characterizations, there’s a sense that every corner of this film is overly constructed. Director Peyton Reed approached the first two Ant-Man movies with a strange flair that never takes the plot’s ridiculousness too seriously, which is exactly what he does here. Unfortunately, everything from the awkward humor to the ludicrously clunky dialogue and detached emotional stakes result in an adventure that runs flat. The visual playfulness from Reed’s previous two solo MCU outings is lacking in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. The CGI is problematic, frequently looking messy, which further sours the introduction of a familiar character. Its big third act recalls hits like Star Wars, but it doesn’t manage to capture the breadth or the depth of its grand world-building. Majors brings all that he can to the role of Kang the Conqueror, establishing himself as the most notable asset the film has. Unfortunately, the film forgets that it’s part of an ongoing film franchise, taking story reveals that the audience already knows and masquerading them as new, shocking twists. The end result feels like filler that doesn’t add anything narratively, thematically, or exciting to the MCU. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an unwieldy and monotonous repackaging of what came before. I'm an avid film buff who's always on the search for the next best indie or horror movie. I'm most likely enjoying a nice cup of tea while writing film reviews or entertainment news."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," In any event, the most important thing that you need to know–aside from the books–is that there are two scenes: mid and post-credit. I’ll have more to say about the film below the photo. If it’s not in the trailer, it’s not down below in terms of the film’s plot. Per Disney and Marvel, the spoiler embargo runs through 12 PM ET/ 9 AM PT on February 24. Welcome to the middle phase of the Multiverse Saga. I’ll be able to expand more on how the film fits into the saga when the spoiler embargo lifts on February 24. But for now, I can say with 100% certainty that viewers are in for a treat. Audiences got a sneak peak of Jonathan Majors as He Who Remains during the first season of Loki. This time around, Majors is front and center as Kang The Conqueror. Mostly known as just The Conqueror, audiences know who he is from the minute he sets foot on screen. One thing for certain is that the family dynamic is much different from previous films. Janet is back in the picture. And again, Cassie is old enough to actually work with her father. It’s her science that gets the family into this mess. Again, that’s more or less Janet’s fault for not communicating. However, it also says something about trauma and how it impacts people. Don’t forget that Janet was down there for some 30 years before Hank pulled her out in Ant-Man and the Wasp. Time and space works differently down there so we don’t know how long it felt for her. What we know (from the trailers) is that she hid her experiences with Kang (Jonathan Majors). Because of this, she knew sending a signal was a bad idea. Among those who we meet in the Quantum Realm are Axia governor Lord Krylar (Bill Murray), Kang’s right-hand man, M.O.D.O.K., the Quantumnauts (Matthew Wood). There’s also Freedom Fighter leader Jentorra (Katy O’Brian), Quaz (William Jackson Harper), Veb (David Dastmalchian), and Xolum (James Cutler). O’Brian was previously in The Mandalorian during its second season and like Matthew Wood, she joins the list of people in both Star Wars and the MCU. We’ll know for sure about the film’s place on the timeline upon its arrival to Disney+ later this year. There’s a new MCU timeline book coming out later this year so any questions will get cleared up. My 2026-27 is speculation based on Cassie’s age during the first Ant-Man movie. She even says in this film that a guy was dressed as a bee and tried to kill her when she was 6. Majors really does make a great addition to the MCU. He is having himself quite the year ever since breaking through during Sundance 2019 with The Last Black Man in San Francisco. Lately, he starred in Devotion, premiered Magazine Dreams during Sundance 2023, and still has Creed III to go. Speaking out of my own personal experience, Jonathan Majors couldn’t be more different from Kang. He is as nice as it gets in real life–someone that you want to have a conversation with! To help give the film its epic experience is a new score from Christophe Beck. Beck changes it up a bit from the previous films but also keeps the themes for Ant-Man, the Wasp, and Hank. The composer doesn’t depend on those themes to drive the film, of course. Instead, he brings a new score while also keeping the spirit from the previous films. In any event, he’s definitely having fun with the music.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” launches Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and these phases are starting to feel like variants in a pandemic. The storylines in every MCU phase depend on leaders heading in the wrong direction, unintentionally, and then fighting their way back to a new normal that may no longer exist (is everything a pandemic metaphor?). But it’s discouraging to see the friskiest MCU franchise swell up like a tick in terms of its reported $200 million production budget and its universe-destroying threat levels while shrinking in effectiveness. “Ant-Man” (2015) was fun; “Ant-Man and the Wasp” (2018) was fun, too. “Quantumania,” again directed by Peyton Reed, is less fun, and blandly garish visually. The earlier films’ throwaway jokes and welcome aversion to brutal solemnity have largely been ditched in favor of endless endgame stuff and weirdly cheesy digital world-building in the Quantum Realm. Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, as is second-billed Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp. Second-billed implies a certain portion of the action and the talking, but Lilly is practically mute in “Quantumania,” and you keep waiting for some explanation for this. A curse? A character grudge we’ll eventually find out about? Payback for a performer’s stance against COVID-19 vaccine mandates?  Aside from the occasional boilerplate  (“I’ve got a read on Scott!”), Hope’s strictly sideline material. The plot this time sends Scott, Hope, Hope’s brilliant and nicely coifed parents (Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas)  and Scott’s enterprising and socially conscious daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), into the sub-universe of Quantumville. Aside from bookend sequences set in San Francisco, the sloggy whole of “Quantumania” takes place down there, in a land of reputed magical visual wonders that look like leftovers from Pandora after being reheated on high in a bowl with reruns of “H.R. Pufnstuf.” Question: How to get back home? Conflict: Why is Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors, trying to kill us, and destroy all worlds? Well, he’s a supervillain, and we’ve seen his like before (in a related guise on Disney’s series “Loki”). We’ll be seeing him again, of course, since Majors  is a fascinating actor. Usually, that is. It depends on the material, as it does for every actor, and here, Majors  spins his wheels trying to make this supervillain his own, and different from all the others. Always a thinker on screen, Majors makes a rare error in dramatic strategy in “Quantumania,” trading dramatic … pauses for mo … mentum and pacing. After an hour, a lot of the lesser MCU movies start to feel like green screen jail, for everyone on screen as well as the audience. Director Reed, forced by the script to lean into the combat melees, still has his ace in the hole, which is Ant-Man and company’s ability to change size in an eyeblink, going from ant size to “Iron Giant” size when needed. The movie, let it be said, is not awful, but the kinetic battles are chaotic, and the look of the Quantum Realm is oddly drab in its interweaving of digital and VFX elements, seeming at times to be more like several first drafts of a new “Star Wars” franchise instead of a natural extension of this one. Midway through, as everyone on screen was restating their interest in getting home again, I thought: Same! Still, not all is lost. “Quantumania” introduces the scowling, fearsome, highly screen-worthy revolution-leading warrior, Jentorra, portrayed by Katy O’Brian. She’s a beast, the best kind, and ready for anything. Even when the film itself isn’t much of anything."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," If there’s a challenge faced by all contemporary purveyors of superhero cinema, where expectations run amok, it’s adjusting the knobs that balance light and dark, the goofy and the grim, comedic character interplay and interplanetary stakes. Those knob settings are, of course, a matter of taste, and certainly a bone of contention between fans of somber grit and those who like a bit — or a lot — of witty banter between mega-punches. With his third Ant-man adventure, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” director Peyton Reed and screenwriter Jeff Loveness (a “Jimmy Kimmel Live” and “Rick and Morty” vet making his big-screen debut) handle the balance of tones impressively. It’s a film that gives Paul Rudd multiple opportunities to display his comic charm, even turning a shameless bit of product placement into an effective running gag. At the same time, it sets the stage for a genuinely chilling villain, one who’s only getting started in what promises to be an ongoing assault upon the reality of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it. That villain, as anyone who’s been watching “Loki” on Disney+ can tell you, is Kang the Conqueror (a riveting Jonathan Majors), a seemingly omnipotent being who can travel to — and destroy — any thread of the multiverse. And as we learn in “Quantumania,” he has a history with Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) that dates back to the 30 years she spent trapped inside the quantum realm. Since returning, she hasn’t wanted to talk to anyone, not even her family, about that time, instead re-embracing a normal life with husband Henry Pym (Michael Douglas); daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly), who has inherited Janet’s mantle as The Wasp; Hope’s partner Scott (Rudd), stepping in for Henry as the second Ant-Man; and Scott’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton, “Freaky”), who’s turning into quite the impassioned activist and science prodigy. But Janet’s secrets are coming out whether she wants them to or not: Cassie and Henry have created a device that will allow them to map the quantum realm, but someone within that realm uses the machine as a homing beacon to shrink down this quintet and bring them there against their will. The first third or so of “Quantumania” allows the production designers, art directors and effects wizards to go wild, creating a series of psychedelic landscapes populated by unfathomable creatures of all shapes and sizes. Here, the quantum realm plays out like an amalgam of every 1970s prog-rock album cover mashed up with every 1970s sci-fi paperback. We’re introduced to some new characters — William Jackson Harper as a reluctant mind-reader, Katy M. O’Brian as an intense warrior, a not-to-be-spoiled cameo by a major star-making their MCU debut — but “Quantumania” really kicks into gear with the arrival of the much-feared Kang, who’s got a nefarious agenda that he can only implement if he can get his hands on some Pym Particles, those scientific marvels that allow Ant-Man and the Wasp to shrink to insect-size or to grow like giants. It’s a frequent complaint about the Marvel movies that they spend more time setting up the next five chapters than they do resolving the one they’re in, but “Quantumania” offers threats both immediate and long-range, making it satisfactory as both an individual movie and as a preview for what’s to come. It also makes generous use of its ensemble; Rudd and Majors — the latter injecting some always-welcome intensity into the MCU — are the key players here, and the yin-and-yang of their sensibilities provides the motor for the plot, while Pfeiffer and Douglas get plenty to do and aren’t treated as nostalgic tag-alongs. While Cassie’s arc could have been unbearably plucky and can-do in less careful hands, Newton grounds the interdimensional adventure with recognizably human care, both for her family and for the lives of those downtrodden by Kang. Admittedly lost among all these characters is Hope; despite the Wasp’s inclusion in the title, Lilly’s superhero comes off as a bit of an afterthought once all is said and done. A strong case can be made that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is better served in its non-cinematic iterations on Disney+, with serialized adventures offering more opportunity for depth of character and complexity of plot. But if it took “Loki” to introduce and explain Kang and his machinations, “Quantumania” sets up what promises to be a lengthy arc for the character, perhaps even jumping between big screen and small over the coming years. At this point in history, the idea of attracting new fans to the MCU is probably moot; most viewers are either on board for this ongoing saga, or they checked out long ago. “Quantumania” may not swing for the fences as ambitiously as recent entries like “Wakanda Forever” or “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” but it does take the wildly disparate tones and plot threads that are seemingly endemic to this series and turn them into an entertainingly cohesive whole. To be continued, obviously."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a solid start to the MCU's Phase 5, working well to serve Scott Lang's story and introduce the menacing Kang.  After an experimental Phase 4 that introduced a host of new characters, Marvel Studios is launching Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. The movie has the dual tasks of not only rounding out Paul Rudd's Ant-Man trilogy that kicked off back in 2015, but setting the stage for what's to come in Phase Five, which is part of the franchise's Multiverse Saga. Thankfully, director Peyton Reed and writer Jeff Loveness are up to the task. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a solid start to the MCU's Phase 5, working well to serve Scott Lang's story and introduce the menacing Kang.   As its name implies, Quantumania sees Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man (Rudd), get dragged into the Quantum Realm alongside his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), his superhero and romantic partner Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and her parents, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Once there, Janet is confronted with her past and all five are targeted by Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a terrifying being who has laid waste to much of the Quantum Realm. Working together, the family has to figure out a way to get home without letting Kang get free of the Quantum Realm.   Quantumania is quite a different kind of Ant-Man movie. Whereas past films in the trilogy were much more grounded than other MCU movies, and often had lower stakes, Quantumania takes its characters to a very fantastical world and raises the stakes exponentially. Still, Loveness and Reed manage to make the movie feel like it fits within the Ant-Man canon, due in large part to the characters. Rudd's Scott Lang has been established and developed not only over the course of the Ant-Man trilogy, but other Avengers team-ups like Endgame and Captain America: Civil War. As such, his humor and his desire to be a good dad help to ground everything fantastical about the Quantum Realm and Scott's adventure.   This also works well as a contrast to the movie's main villain, who, other than Scott, is Quantumania's primary focus. Kang is larger than life, speaking about time in a way that feels unfathomable to a regular human like Scott, and it's this contrast with Rudd's hero that makes Majors' villain so menacing. When Rudd and Majors are onscreen together, Quantumania is truly exhilarating, showcasing exactly what makes the MCU so special — talented actors bringing to life these epic stories of good and evil. It helps that the remainder of the cast are exceptionally strong, too. Newton's Cassie gets some great moments of her own, though it's Pfeiffer's Janet who shines brightest after Rudd and Majors. Douglas also has some fantastic line deliveries that bring a lot of Ant-Man's signature humor to the film. Lilly has a lot less to do in this movie than past Ant-Man outings, but has a few moments. The scene-stealer, though, is the actor who plays M.O.D.O.K., who's an absolute delight in Quantumania.   Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to successfully be both a fantastic addition to the Ant-Man trilogy — perhaps even the best of the bunch — and set the stage for what's to come in the MCU's Phase Five. Reed and Loveness accomplish this by balancing the stories of Scott Lang and Kang, making them the most important characters of the movie. While that means others get left a little by the wayside, particularly Lilly's Hope, it makes for a much stronger movie. Quantumania isn't necessarily the MCU's riskiest outing, it doesn't take many chances and instead feels like the product of a well-oiled machine, but after nearly 15 years of Marvel films, it's both fresh and familiar enough to satisfy general audiences.   As such, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a must-see for Marvel fans, not only because it's a genuinely entertaining addition to the MCU, but because it's important to the overarching story of Phase 5 and the Multiverse Saga. That said, though there are aspects of Quantumania that are best enjoyed by those who have seen the previous Ant-Man movies, they aren't necessarily required viewing to understand this film. As with many MCU movies, Quantumania is most rewarding to those who have invested in the franchise, but is enjoyable enough even for casual viewers. Still, the real draw of the movie is Majors' Kang, who's poised to be the next major villain of the MCU and, while Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania effectively sets up the big bad, it also makes plenty of room for the little guy.  Ant-Man went from unappreciated hero to a worldwide celebrity, & the road to that wasn't easy at all. Here's how much Ant-Man has changed in the MCU. Bob Marley: One Love rises up the chart of the highest-grossing music biopics at the worldwide box office as it prepares to hit a major milestone. The Bikeriders is already similar to a 16-year-old TV show, but after a new trailer, this TV show might have already spoiled the movie's ending."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," For better and for worse, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has opted to introduce its new “big bad” to cinemagoers within its goofiest series of films, those of Ant-Man and the Wasp. Following the conclusion of the Infinity Saga (and Phase Three) with Avengers: Endgame, the greater MCU has been biding its time in Phase Four, largely ushering in a hoard of new characters and wandering down CGI-laden rabbit holes rather than concentrating on a cohesive narrative arc. With the arrival of Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, however, the mega-franchise pivots to focus on its new antagonist, Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror. In some multiverse iteration, it will be Kang who presumably faces off against the Avengers in the Phase Six duology, Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars. Kang, who appeared briefly in the finale of Loki, is a deathly serious, multiverse-jumping war lord who spends his time obliterating entire dimensions and pontificating on temporal philosophy. It therefore makes total sense (read: it makes no sense at all) that Kang would get his grand entrance in a film alongside aliens that look like broccoli and recurring butthole jokes. Our insectile family is split in half during their quantum journey with Team 1, comprised of Ant-Man and his daughter Cassie (now played by Kathryn Newton), landing in a more sloppily created version of Strange World while Team 2, made up of Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), and the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), crashes on Tatooine in the desert. Team 1 meets a Mos Eisley Cantina Band-esque hoard of alien freedom fighters including William Jackson Harper (from NBC’s The Good Place) and his glowing forehead, a chatty blob of Jell-O, and a more muscular version of the Pixar lamp. Team 2 is met by Tusken Raiders sand nomads and taken to the Quantum Realm equivalent of a Delta Sky Club lounge where they find Janet’s old bestie Krylar (a fun celebrity cameo we won’t spoil). It’s here we learn that Janet and Kang were stranded together in the quantum abyss, trying to escape for many years in Kang’s ship before Janet realized Kang loved genocide and destroyed his power source. Now Kang has sucked Team Ant-Man back into the Quantum Realm in order to finally escape from his purgatory. Of course Lando Calrissian Krylar quickly betrays our heroes, who are hauled off to Coruscant a massive city to face off against Kang and his Stormtroopers henchmen while he tries to launch his Death Star giant, spheric, universe-destroying battleship. For its entire run time, Quantumania, which, like its predecessors was directed by Peyton Reed, but was penned by Rick and Morty writer and Marvel newbie Jeff Loveness, seems dead set on being both a slapstick comedy and a dramatic space epic. Kang, bolstered by an ominous, award-worthy performance from Majors, is set up to be a Darth Vader Thanos-level horror. But Kang’s scenes are surrounded by those featuring Douglas doofily proclaiming his love for ants and a Humpty Dumpty villain that rivals Jar Jar Binks in ludicrousness. The film is so preposterously disjointed in tone that viewers will struggle to decide if its wild swings are lunacy or genius (or perhaps a combination of both). Compared to slogs like Thor: Love and Thunder and most of the MCU television shows, however, Quantumania is certainly entertaining from start to finish, and it’s the first film since Endgame with real stakes. Its Star Wars-esque world-building also gives it freshness as it swaps tired superhero tropes for those of sci-fi epics. Of course, Quantumania does suffer from some of the MCU’s recent systemic problems such as an abundance of sloppy green screen work, way too many characters (Lilly has maybe 15 lines in the whole film), and an over-reliance on television show connections. Choosing to hold crucial details for the two post-credit scenes leads to Kang using veiled pronouns and vague language in order to save a (still somewhat confusing) surprise for the audience.  Quantumania’s tone is sure to be polarizing, but if you can surrender yourself to its bonkers A Bug’s Life-meets-Return of the Jedi antics, the two hours (already short for a Marvel film) will fly by. Now we just need Pym to invent some lightsabers for their next trip to a galaxy far far away the multiverse. "
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," Those prophetic words are spoken by Kang the Conqueror in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” but they apply just as easily to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the pop culture behemoth that has self-iterated into infinity, wiping out what used to be called “movies” and co-opting an entire medium for generations to come. Reportedly, “Quantumania” is part of the MCU’s Phase 5, which — okay. Is anyone really still keeping track? Since “Avengers: Endgame,” the new installments have sought to introduce new storylines and characters to keep the vibe alive (also known as maintaining billion-dollar profits), with mixed success. Here, we meet Kang, played with mournful menace by the superb Jonathan Majors. But his Shakespearean gravitas feels woefully out of place in one of the Ant-Man movies, which, with their cheerful, wholesome tone, have been the most little-kid-friendly offshoots of the ever-growing “Avengers” sequoia. In “Quantumania,” sprightly pacing and lighthearted humor have succumbed to the turgid seriousness that plagues so much of the comic book canon. Granted, Paul Rudd still projects irresistible likability as Scott Lang, the onetime thief who as Ant-Man is the tiniest member of the Avengers team. As “Quantumania” opens, Scott is reading from his new memoir, “Look Out for the Little Guy,” in a cheeky montage set to the theme from “Welcome Back, Kotter.” So far, so adorable. But soon enough, Scott; his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton); his girlfriend, Hope (Evangeline Lilly); and Hope’s parents, Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne (Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer), are plunged into the Quantum Realm, a secret universe “outside time and space” that has been seemingly populated by psychedelic bathtub toys and constructed from the remnants of vintage Yes album covers (ask your grandparents). The plot — which is very plotty — is beside the point in “Quantumania,” which pulls from a variety of sources for both its themes and its visuals. On-trend subjects like the multiverse and hegemonic tyranny come in for comment and critique; the production design grabs snippets from the “Star Wars” cantina scene and reaches back to Ray Harryhausen, Japanese kaiju and “King Kong” for inspo in the final showdowns. All of the actors acquit themselves with dignity amid the outlandishness: Pfeiffer’s Janet turns out to be a chief protagonist in a story that delves into her past in the Quantum Realm. Still preternaturally beautiful, Pfeiffer strides through the spaceship rides, dingus battles and inevitable climactic faceoff with the same coolness she brought to the zonked-out femme fatale in “Scarface.” The film’s biggest cameo falls awkwardly flat; as heartening as it is to see William Jackson Harper play a Quantum Realm rebel, he’s largely wasted in a film that’s less interested in character development than in action beats and deliverables. “Quantumania” will most likely work as dutiful, if not particularly original, fan service. But for those of us who still crave films about recognizable human beings, there’s something dispiriting about watching such gifted actors legitimize yet another generically familiar sequel. The disconnect is particularly obvious watching Rudd — a brilliant comic actor and hugely appealing leading man — spending most of “Quantumania” running and yelling amid green-screen fakery and CGI filler. The endearing sweetness of the early “Ant-Man” movies, which tapped Rudd’s ineffable charm, has been bigfooted into a noisy, smash-and-grab extravaganza that, for all its self-conscious bigness, feels smaller and less ambitious than its predecessors. It’s never over. But it could be better."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," Now 31 films and five “phases” deep, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is as big as big can be: an unstoppable juggernaut (if not the X-Men mutant Juggernaut) of a machine, gigantic and crushing. But as oppressive and bland a behemoth as the MCU has become, it‘s also smuggled tiny nuggets of wit and joy into the margins of its films – moments so small, really, to be ant-sized. While the Hulk was busy smashing and Doctor Strange conjuring, director Peyton Reed’s pair of Ant-Man films delivered welcome bursts of low-stakes fun that felt multiverses removed from the overwhelming sameness of the MCU’s disingenuous Avengers spectacles. Reed’s first superhero outing, 2015′s Ant-Man, was a thoroughly enjoyable piece of pop, a bouncy heist film wrapped in the guise of a traditional comic-book origin story. Reed’s follow-up, 2018′s Ant-Man and the Wasp, was slightly diminished owing to increasingly convoluted MCU continuity obligations, but still retained the successful formula of its predecessor: 60 per cent humour, 20 per cent action, 18 per cent impeccable casting, 2 per cent ants. Eternally boyish star Paul Rudd is essential to Ant-Man’s what-me-worry comic energy, but he needs the verve of previous franchise co-stars Michael Douglas, Michael Pena, Judy Greer, Bobby Cannavale and Randall Park to bounce off, too. (Evangeline Lilly has always been around, too, but her Wasp hero is given so little colour that she can only be a good sport about it all, a task she manages easily enough.) Certainly, the adventures themselves aren’t of much consequence, but that’s kind of the point, too – Reed’s Ant-Man films are low-key hangout films. All manner of people and cars and multistorey buildings might shrink and supersize themselves, but the movies are careful to humanize even the tiniest of bit players, up to and including the actual ants. All of which is why Reed’s third Marvel outing, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, is such a sloppy and rotten thing to stomach. Interminable, ugly and almost completely bereft of charm, the new film is both a dispiriting reminder that the MCU has abandoned wit and that even the most clever and idiosyncratic of filmmakers can be steamrolled by the unstoppable obligations of corporate storytelling. Set after the events of Avengers: Endgame, in which thief-turned-hero Scott Lang (Rudd) prepaid the price for saving the world by spending years trapped inside the subatomic particle universe known as the Quantum Realm, everyone’s favourite teeny-tiny Avenger is busy trying to make up for lost time by bonding with his now twentysomething daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). Trouble is that Cassie is more interested in hanging out with surrogate grandpa/super-scientist Hank Pym (Douglas), together developing a device that will let them communicate with the Quantum Realm. Which is also where Hank’s wife, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), spent three decades of her life trapped after a rescue mission gone awry. Quickly – far too quickly, as the best part of the Ant-Man films are watching regular-guy Lang balance his Avengers fame with real-world responsibilities – the whole family is zapped into the Quantum Realm, where a mysterious being named Kang (Jonathan Majors) is plotting something disastrous. Add in a sleepy Bill Murray cameo, a few visually incomprehensible action set-pieces, and lots – and lots – of dry-as-dust Kang monologues that will only make sense to Marvel acolytes who paid careful attention to the dude’s first MCU appearance in last year’s Disney+ series Loki, and you have the makings of a depressingly disposable thing. Like this past fall’s similarly undercooked Disney film Strange World, Quantumania mistakes multicoloured blobs and squishy floating goop for a genuinely “weird” visual style, as if a kindergartener were asked to ape the works of Salvador Dali with a box of broken crayons. Coloured wall-to-fake-wall with cheap-looking CGI, the film looks like it was shot from inside the guts of a first-generation iPhone – there is an aesthetic emptiness to it all that is soul-crushing. And the less said about the character design of Kang’s sidekick MODOK (that would stand for Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing) the better: The villain is an aggressively garish creation that will make your eyes bleed when they aren’t rolling. Decades of VFX innovation and countless billions of dollars spent to build imaginary onscreen worlds, and the darkly lit, painfully ugly nothingness of the Quantum Realm is the best that Hollywood can come up with? Almost as depressing is just how determined Reed – or, more likely, his MCU minders – seem to be in stripping any remnant of the real-world delights of his first two films. Pena, Greer and Cannavale are all absent (Park, too, aside from a wordless two-second appearance), as is the playful inventiveness with which Reed shrunk and supersized Lang’s home-base of San Francisco. The concept and importance of scale – so crucial to a movie about a guy whose superpower is, you know, getting bigger and smaller – is rendered non-existent. The Quantum Realm is just another barren space for things to go pew-pew-pew-bang-crash-boom, devoid of dimension. (Any hope that Reed would be paying homage to Joe Dante’s classic adventure Innerspace – not unreasonable, given that Quantumania’s poster directly references that 1987 film – goes out the window immediately.) There is one good thing to say about Quantumania, though: Like its two predecessors, it is entirely skippable for even the die hardest of MCU diehards. Without wading into dreaded spoiler territory, the consequences of its story are meaningless, its much anticipated end-credits sequences (there are two, for those who need to know) essentially bridging narrative gaps that don’t quite need to be connected. With the first two Ant-Man films, this standalone-ness was a feature, not a bug – it just allowed more time for Reed to develop his characters and sharpen the comedy. Here, it’s all stage-setting for a franchise long past its prime. Good on Rudd and everyone else involved for grabbing that MCU money, but this is truly baby-food cinema. Mush that can either stuff you to sleep or be thrown at the wall."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," By  Charles Pulliam-Moore, a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, from director Peyton Reed, wants to make you laugh. But it also wants you to think it’s cool — kind of like a dad who doesn’t know how to relate to you now that you’re both adults who can recognize that he’s always sorta only had maybe one or two good bits. Quantumania knows those bits have worked in the past, and it gamely whips them out as part of the Ant-Man series’ most visually imaginative stories yet. But rather than coasting on its sense of dad-focused humor, Quantumania tries to switch things up a bit by mainlining a few doses of whatever psychedelics Doctor Strange has been brewing and inviting you to partake in a little madness that doesn’t always make sense. Quantumania knows that Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has come such a long way since he first popped up in the MCU back in 2015 that more than a few people are going to need refreshers about who he is and where he’s been. But as it’s doing its best to fill you in on what Scott and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) have been up to since becoming Avengers, you can immediately tell that Quantumania’s story is best experienced with its predecessors fresh in your mind. Set some time after Avengers: Endgame, Quantumania catches up with Scott at the height of his relatively newfound fame as the world’s biggest, smallest, and most Average White Guy™ costumed hero who also happens to be a best-selling author. People might not know who all the Guardians of the Galaxy are or how the Scarlet Witch kidnapped an entire town. But everybody remembers Ant-Man getting real big that one time while fighting Thanos and how the idea of getting back to his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) was the one thing that kept him going while he was trapped in the Quantum Realm. But what the public doesn’t really know — because Scott didn’t put it in his book — is how being away from Cassie for so long has created an emotional distance between them that he’s terrified he may never be able to close. From pretty much Eternals on, each of Marvel’s recent films has prioritized parenthood for its protagonists in a way that’s felt intentional and like part of a larger plan for the MCU’s future. With its immediate focus on Cassie and Scott’s relationship, Quantumania highlights this clearly as it digs into how she grew up to be a troublemaking activist while he was out for quantum cigarettes. But for all the specific emotional heft Quantumania wants its father / daughter reunion plot to have, that same focus on the MCU’s future leads to it feeling rather weightless as it’s subsumed into a much larger story about a not-so-secret subatomic universe full of wonder. It’s impressive how quickly writer Jeff Loveness’ script brings Hope’s mother, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), and father, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), back into focus and sets to reestablishing how Janet’s own time being trapped in the Quantum Realm put a strain on her bond with her daughter. Just when it seems like the movie’s poised to properly dig into those complex feelings, though, Quantumania instead shifts into action mode as it sends Langs, the Van Dynes, and Hank into the Quantum Realm to meet the MCU’s new big bad. It’s as team Ant-Man’s getting beamed down to the Quantum Realm in a blinding flash of light that you get your first taste of the artful but disorienting chaos that defines much of Quantumania’s subatomic aesthetic. After years of Marvel teasing out what a dangerous, incomprehensible place the Quantum Realm might be, Quantumania dives in headfirst and reveals it to be a sprawling, lush universe teeming with seemingly alien life that Janet pointedly never mentioned to anyone. After two Doctor Strange movies and other Marvel fare like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, very little about Quantumania’s glowing, pulsing lava lamp of a microverse will surprise you, really. But it is beautiful in an immersive, animated wallpaper sort of way. Both the original Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp really ran with the idea of Pym Particles to craft set pieces that played with viewers’ sense of perspective as things we’re used to seeing as tiny objects became humongous, and vice versa.  In those films, something as mundane as going down a bathtub drain became extraordinary because it was easy to understand what was happening and the wildness of it all. Quantumania tries to do the same with its foray into the Quantum Realm, which often looks and feels like a cross between Osmosis Jones’ City of Frank and any number of Star Wars’ technologically advanced, war-torn alien worlds. But because we don’t really have a solid frame of reference for the Quantum Realm, it’s often hard to watch Quantumania and not see actors standing on soundstages trying to imagine what it might be like to walk through a lava lamp where lighting seems to come from all directions. Janet’s emotional withholding from her family and the way she keeps Hope in particular at arm’s length are some of Quantumania’s more interesting beats that actually give Pfeiffer and Lilly a chance to flex their dramatic muscles more than you’d expect to see in an Ant-Man film. Quantumania wants you to care about the Van Dynes in the same way that it wants you to care about the Langs. But ultimately, the movie puts much more energy into establishing how important Janet and a time traveler named Kang (Jonathan Majors) became to one another after first meeting in the Quantum Realm, and that choice makes Quantumania feel bigger in some ways and smaller in others. Strictly speaking, Quantumania’s Kang is another reality’s variant of Loki’s He Who Remains, but here Majors has the opportunity to fully spread his wings and take flight as a bombastic, menacing villain who revels in the theatricality of being an overlord. Kang’s the reason Janet swore she’d never return to the Quantum Realm, and she’s a big part of the reason why he wants to escape it, but Quantumania never lets you forget that the pair weren’t always adversaries. Both because of the way Majors inhabits Kang with an intense, mesmerizing mania and because of the way Quantumania frames Janet as an aloof, Complicated Mom™ who hordes secrets, their dynamic ends up being the film’s most interesting. But between Kang and Janet’s thing, the Van Dynes’ drama, the Langs bonding, and yet another plot about the Quantum Realm’s refugees rising up, Quantumania frequently feels like it’s got just a little bit too much going on. To a certain extent, that’s to be expected from an ambitious threequel that’s trying to set itself apart from the smaller-stakes movies that came before it. It might be a little weird if the MCU suddenly became a neater and tidier place, narratively speaking, just because it was entering its fifth big chapter. That said, it’s also a little weird how abruptly Quantumania ends — so much so that it’s a little unclear how things stand with the universe as the movie’s credits start rolling. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’s far from being a bad movie. But it is a testament to how out in the weeds Marvel’s gotten with the MCU and how the studio’s approach to building fantastical VFX worlds still has a way of making things look far less expensive than they should, given their budgets. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has a lot going for it, though, and it’s obvious this story’s going to factor largely into whatever the future holds for the Avengers. Watching it might feel a bit like doing homework at times, but at this point, it seems like that might just be part of the price of admission. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania also stars William Jackson Harper, Katy O’Brian, Randall Park, Bill Murray, and Corey Stoll. The film hits theaters on February 17th."

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. Until now, Marvel’s littlest Avenger has been a reliable resource of smaller-scale larks amid the MCU’s gustier arcs. While Ant-Man (2015) offered a frisky palate-cleanser between the city-wrecking rucks of Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War, Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) soothed with juice-box quips after Avengers: Infinity War’s flaky finale. Which begs the question: can the mini-marvel shoulder the load of larger MCU responsibilities?  The answer is a guarded ‘yes’ on the strength of Quantumania, give or take a few wobbles on the MCU dividing line between standalone fun and expanded universe-building. If Ant-Man’s growth curve gets choppy as he’s mobilised to launch Phase 5 and steer the MCU into newly expansive realms, his footsteps still land louder than ever: which they need to, given the fresh threat he’s required to face.  In the MCU’s latest instalment of post-Blip fallout, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is busy soaking up his fame when we meet him here. Besides launching his memoir, he poses for selfies with strangers’ dogs and laps up free coffees, even if his barista mistakes him for the Avengers’ other bug-man. But Lang has bigger crises than the critter competition. Struggling emotionally with her father’s Blip-years absence, and frustrated with his seeming retreat from hero duties, Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has taken to staging climate and recession protests. And ending up in jail.  When Scott and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) realise Cassie has also been investigating – inspired by Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) - the Quantum Realm, they’re impressed and horrified. And doubly horrified when an accident sucks both families (Evangeline Lilly’s Hope included) into the subatomic world, realm of many uncertainties. How do they get home? Must they drink the ooze? And, crucially, what’s up with all-conquering despot Kang (Jonathan Majors)?  Writer Jeff Loveness (Rick And Morty) and returning director Peyton Reed posit a scenario familiar from classic pulp sci-fi stories here. Torn between joining the uprising against Kang or focusing their energies on saving themselves, our outsiders become involved when the options converge.  The terrifically imagined results offer the MCU’s most tripped-out sci-fi material yet, even alongside the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. But one scene involving Hank pinpoints an attention-deficit problem. One minute he’s talking about how the Quantum Realm changes everything, science-wise; the next, he’s all, “Holy shit, that guy looks like broccoli!” Elsewhere, up pops Bill Murray, whose cameo includes drinking a squid. Between the manifold diversions and the dangers of CG fatigue, Quantumania struggles to secure its narrative footing.  Gradually, though, the story finds its stride and stamps boot-marks on the MCU’s future. No, not because of floaty death-bot MODOK (no casting spoilers, just in case), who’s more fun than fearsome with his Deadpool 2-ish ""baby legs"". Given time to make his presence felt, Kang begins as a seductive figure until a charged exchange with Janet - Pfeiffer is well-deployed - reveals just what a deadly proposition he will be.  Will the Multi-family Saga follow the Multiverse Saga? With the kids of Hulk, Thor, T’Challa, Wanda and others also in the MCU’s Young Avengers mix, it’s an option.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," As I sat through the interminable end credits for “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” seeing name after name scroll by, waiting for the inevitable short “surprise” scenes that have long since ceased being a surprise, I noticed something interesting: Paul Rudd has not one but two hair stylists. Huh. Funny, he doesn’t seem like the high-maintenance type. It’s not like he’s playing Mozart in powdered wigs — he’s playing an Avenger who either shrinks or grows to super-gigantic size, depending on the situation. Just normal hair stuff. And sometimes he wears a helmet. Maybe there were mussing issues. If this seems an inordinate amount of time to spend on an actor’s hair, well, it is. But it means less time spent talking about the movie. Which is too bad, because I like most Marvel movies as a rule, and the cast is talented and star-studded. In addition to Rudd, there’s Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jonathan Majors, Corey Stoll and Bill Murray. She plays Cassie Lang, the daughter of Scott Lang (Rudd), or Ant-Man, and she's the best thing about the movie. When the story begins Scott is strolling down the streets of San Francisco to “Welcome Back,” the theme from the 1970s sitcom “Welcome Back, Kotter.” “My life doesn’t really make any sense,” Scott thinks to himself. He’s an ex-con who somehow wound up an Avenger, fighting alongside the likes of Captain America, saving the world. (As humblebrags go, it’s a good one.) He’s even written an autobiography. But Scott has grown complacent, happy to live off his past, something that bugs Cassie, who has become a rebel, getting arrested at a protest. Later, at dinner with her dad, and with Hope (Lilly) — also the Wasp — and Hope’s parents Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas) and Janet (Pfeiffer), she admits she’s been working on a project in Hank’s basement lab. It’s a way to map the Quantum Realm, which makes Hank beam with pride (Scott and Hope, too), but terrifies Janet. Turns out she has a past in that realm, even more than we knew already. Let’s pause here to say that if this sounds confusing, it’s because it is confusing. And if you haven’t seen the films leading up to this one (the third “Ant-Man” film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) and aren’t familiar with all the storylines leading up to this point, you will be hopelessly lost and not even a map of the Quantum Realm will help you find your way. Things go awry, as they are wont to do, and the whole gang finds themselves flung even deeper in the Quantum Realm. Scott and Cassie get separated from the rest, and are immediately kidnapped by creatures who look like they wandered out of the Los Eisley Cantina scene in “Star Wars.” Meanwhile, the others run into old friends and foes of Janet’s, including Krylar (Murray), who has a past with Janet but is now a kind of goofball despot — but also the tool of a greater force. That would be Kang, played with menace by Majors, but menace delivered in the weird cadence of William Shatner's line readings in “Star Trek.” Like everyone else in the Quantum Realm, Kang has a past with Janet, but one even more dangerous. From there it’s a race to get back home and to save the realm they’re in, which Janet inadvertently helped turn into a kind of dystopian nightmare of a place ruled by Kang. There are some good moments, many of them belonging to Newton’s Lang, as she tries to bond with her father, who went missing during the Blip (again, if you know, you know). Newton is funny and genuine, even among all the effects. You’d think a movie about the potential for the destruction of universes would feel pretty high stakes, but this one doesn’t. Nor does it connect on the family drawn together through adversity front. Kang, if you know your Marvel lore, is all about the multiverse, which is rapidly going from a compelling idea to a storytelling shortcut. You can just change anything around and claim it happened in a different universe. As in life, no rules sounds like fun, but in practice, it’s too unwieldy to work. Kang has a line that is great but also illustrates the problem. Upon meeting Scott, he says, “Oh, you’re an Avenger? Have I killed you before?” Though it can work, as a movie like “Everything Everywhere All at Once” proves. Though in that case discipline still exists. It’s just buried beneath the weirdness."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," The first instalment of Phase Five of the MCU comes with a lot of baggage. It’s not just the third superhero movie about stocky everyman turned size-fluid Avenger, Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). It’s also the big screen debut of infinitely devious multiverse baddie, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), whose legacy is so powerful that an Avengers project we’ll see in two years’ time bears the title The Kang Dynasty. Sometimes the weight of all this responsibility causes Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania – which is almost entirely set in the “quantum realm” – to buckle at the knees. But mostly this story of a beleaguered little guy and his loved ones stands tall because the cast is so solid (especially Majors). Also, its humour is in the right place. Remember the emotionally damaged scientist, Darren, from the first Ant-Man movie? Well, he’s back, albeit visually altered (imagine Humpty Dumpty, crossed with an angry armchair). Corey Stoll’s slightly dick-ish character all but steals the show. I think I’m in love. But wait, not everyone saw the Ant-Man movies (or Avengers: Endgame, or the TV show Loki). So let’s have a quick recap for those who have busy lives, no access to Disney + and/or a Scorsese-like disdain for this genre. Scott got his Ant-Man suit and powers thanks to a testy genius and former S.H.I.E.L.D scientist, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), whose equally brilliant wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) found herself trapped in the quantum realm for 29 years. Hank and Janet’s daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lilly), is Scott’s love interest and a wily warrior in her own right (she’s the titular Wasp).  At the start of Quantumania, as Scott basks in the fact that he and the rest of the Avengers managed to save the world from Thanos, the Pyms are celebrating the can-do spirit of Scott’s activist teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). The latter has created a “Hubble Telescope” that will allow her to spy on the land where Time and Space get trippy.  Janet, however, is horrified by Cassie’s invention. And when all five get dragged into the quantum realm, we discover why. Turns out Janet and power-mad Kang (whose melancholy and verbose variant made such a splash in season one of Loki) are old enemies. Pfieffer and Douglas are given plenty of room here to show off their comic timing. Janet was a career woman with “needs” (Bill Murray pops up, as her one-time paramour, the grandiose bon viveur, Krylar) and the bit where Hank admits that he himself had a few dinner-dates, while his wife was “away”, is brilliantly down-to-earth.  As is much of the humour. A debate about how many “holes” Scott has is another casually cheeky highlight and puts the spotlight on an excellent new character, the gelatinous and excitable freedom-fighter, Veb (David Dastmalchian). There’s a huge hole in the proceedings, where Michael Pena’s ex-con, Luis, from the previous films, should be, and Newton takes a while to settle into her role. Also the visuals owe too much to Star Wars (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but the scale of this worship is embarrassing). Still, when the special effects click, the result is glorious. The beauty and power of teeming ‘red’ ants (I swear Hank specifically compares the creatures to socialists) has never been more prominently displayed. If you can ignore the convoluted plot – not, sadly, a rarity in the increasingly complex Marvel Cinematic Universe – you’ll have a blast with these characters. In a typically sharp in-joke, Kang says of the Avengers, “They all blur together, after a while”. Ha ha, I totally disagree."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the inaugural film in the Marvel Cinematic Univere's fifth phase, serving as an important stepping stone into the broader universe following the more personal storylines in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It's got plenty of action and adventure, with stunning effects and solid performances from the central cast. But the film lacks a strong emotional throughline, a problem that ends up making the entire experience far less enjoyable than it appears on paper. While Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a fun ride at times and by no means the worst MCU film, it also lacks the key element that elevates the best entries in the franchise.   Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania nominally focuses on Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), both living in a world that celebrates the Avengers. Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has been following in their footsteps, even developing a shrinking suit while working on a potential beacon to the Quantum Realm. But when that piece of technology is activated from the inside, the three -- along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) are dragged into the realm.   They find the Quantum Realm to be a surprisingly dense and populated place, full of bizarre lifeforms and strange communities -- all under the control of Kang (Jonathan Majors), who is also trapped in the realm. Requiring Scott's skills and size-changing Pym Particles to repair his technology and allow him to return to the universe, Kang uses a captured Cassie as a bargaining chip while Wasp, Hank, and Jan make their way across the Quantum Zone in search of the two to stop Kang from returning to the universe.   There's nothing wrong with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania on a technical level, with some of the MCU's best special effects on display in the film. The Quantum Realm itself quickly proves to be a unique and colorful setting, with director Peyton Reed and the rest of the creative team finding plenty of fun ways to incorporate the strangeness of the setting into the action, comedy, and drama of the film. Reed's inventive nature comes into play during some well-staged fight scenes, and there are a few moments -- like Scott's encounter with his timeline copies -- that work very well. The cast is all solid in their roles, and newcomers like Newton acquaint themselves well with the film. The highlight is Majors, who does a good job establishing Kang as a dangerous but different sort of villain than the heroes of the MCU have encountered before. There are minor beats in the film where his veneer of restraint peels off just a little bit to reveal a deep wealth of rage, and it lends the performance a lot of imposing energy.   What's ultimately the most frustrating element of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the script. The movie fails to present a strong emotional arc. There's plenty of promising setup in the film's first act, with Scott and Cassie's relationship troubles quietly mirroring the lingering drama between the Pyms. There's potential for Scott to seek out the years he'd lost without his daughter, a bittersweet desire he shares with Jan. But none of that is paid anything beyond minor lip service as the film progresses and leans heavily into the sci-fi-tinted adventures within the Quantum Realm. As a result, the film largely relies on charm and comedy to keep the audience engaged.   Unfortunately, this is where the film can fall flat, with only a handful of jokes really earning the kind of laughs needed to elevate the experience. There's a lack of emotional growth in the film, making it less of a story and more of a series of loosely connected anecdotes. From a filmmaking standpoint, there's little wrong with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. But without a solid emotional throughline in the script, there's no real reason for the audience to invest. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pure spectacle, through and through -- and while that works on a visual level and easily sets up Majors' Kang as a solid overarching threat going forward, the spectacle can ultimately feel hollow.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania star Paul Rudd says he loves that Scott Lang is a regular guy and a father in Marvel's world full of superheroes."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," It’s tough to make truly trippy cinema. The bold ones break through. 2001: A Space Odyssey’s Star Gate sequence can still hurl you into an altered state at 3am. Alex Garland’s Annihilation, which turned people into flora, was fresh. It can even be done on the cheap, as Shane Meadows proved with Dead Man’s Shoes’ shuddering LSD sequence, and Ben Wheatley did with A Field In England’s juddering psychedelia. It’s odd, then, that Marvel, with all their resources, have made a film set in a universe where time and space are not as we know them, yet have ended up with something that that looks surreal, but feels shackled. Mind-bending it is not. But that doesn’t mean it’s not fun. Following two frothier outings, the third Ant-Man film takes Earth’s tiniest hero to bigger places. Time/space jumper Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is living his best life, and the first few minutes of Quantumania set up potentially meaty material. Scott’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) challenges his chill — while she fights for causes she believes in, he’s just being happy and famous. She’s young and idealistic, full of vim and vigour, which may be important later (spoiler: it will). Meanwhile, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), having been rescued from decades stuck in the Quantum Realm, is harbouring secrets about what went on down there (spoiler: a lot). But before any one of them can really get into any of it, the quantum shit hits the quantum fan, and they’re all transported to crazy-land. At its best, Quantumania plays out like an episode of 1960s Star Trek, those hefty themes and more — idealism, abandonment, morality, identity — explored within the context of a wild universe inhabited by wackadoodle aliens. It’s scripted by sometime Rick And Morty writer Jeff Loveness, which is clear via the more surreal highlights — the creature curious about human holes; the walking, talking broccoli; the take on Marvel Comics legend MODOK, an utterly ridiculous killing machine, the film gleefully leaning into his silliness. The madness, though, feels somehow restrained. There are imaginative set-pieces, notably a bit where Scott encounters endless versions of himself, but they feel like lesser versions of things we’ve seen before — in The Matrix, say, or, even in the MCU itself (nothing here matches the invention of Doctor Strange’s trippier sequences). And throughout, you can practically smell the green-screen — as good as the CGI is, there’s just so much of it. This film makes the Star Wars prequels seem subtle, and what is there never feels quite freaky enough, especially as it lurches towards an all-too conventional climax. The edge is missing across the board. Considering this is the first MCU film to introduce the new Big Bad for the foreseeable, the motivations for Jonathan Majors’ timeline-controlling, world-vanquishing Kang The Conqueror seem somewhat nebulous. And despite the story presenting huge consequences, it all feels peculiarly inconsequential, more interested in paving the way for what comes next. In trying to compete with the more seismic MCU films — in going big — this franchise loses some of its charm. Ant-Man is better small. And yet… Majors is an enthralling watch. His Kang — or at least, this particular variant — is furtive and odd, a world, a history behind his eyes. Kang is formidable and intimidating, but Majors imbues him with inherent eccentricity, captivatingly so, making the multiversal villain multi-dimensional. The best scenes are not the ones populated by bizarro creatures, but the ones involving Majors and Pfeiffer just talking, thrashing out their complex history. A sizeable chunk of the film is just that, and it’s tense, chewy stuff, proper back-to-basics human interaction. If it’s a shame the rest of the film is lacking that, there is at least enough of it to hang on to, and enough goofiness to have a laugh with, including some pretty cool ant shenanigans. Quantumania might be more lightweight than it thinks it is, but it’s got a few surprises up its sleeve, drawing on decades of the comic’s nuttier ideas. The MODOK merch is coming."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"  He is the mini of the multiverse, the littlest man on Marvel's campus. And a lot of Ant-Man's charm when the character first debuted in his own standalone movie in 2015 was in fact the human scale of the story: a blithe, goofy comedy that just happened to have superhero stuff in it (and of course, the deathless dimples of Paul Rudd).
  Director Peyton Reed's antic 2018 followup, Ant-Man and the Wasp, went bigger and busier (and ultimately duller), as sequels do. Both the trailer and the subtitle of the third installment, Quantumania (in theaters this Friday), pretty much give the game away: Small has gone psychedelic, a flamboyant alloy of analog Old Hollywood (Bill Murray, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas), Marvel IP, and clamoring cosmic razzle dazzle.
  For a few expository minutes, at least, Rudd is just Scott Lang again, ""a divorced-dad ex-con"" who once helped save the world from Thanos and now has written a cheerful memoir about his version of events, Look Out for the Little Guy. He still has his faithful longtime girlfriend, Hope (Evangeline Lilly), a.k.a. the Wasp, and a now-teenage daughter, Cassie (Blockers' Kathyrn Newton); even his would-be in-laws, the mad scientists Hank and Janet (Douglas and Pfeiffer) have settled into mellow domesticity.
  Except they haven't, really: Janet continues to be haunted by her time in the Quantum Realm, the subatomic dimension in which she was stranded for three decades, though she hates to speak about it — unaware that Hank, happily oblivious to her secret trauma, has been helping Cassie build a DIY portal to it in his basement. When light beams and quantum things go awry, all five are sucked into the Realm, and microverse chaos begins.
  What they find there is not, it turns out, the barren place that Janet portrayed but a whole tiny cosmos, a sprawling Star Wars cantina of extraterrestrial spheres and species. And the man they all learn to fear is someone she (and any Disney+ subscribers who watched Loki) know well: Kang the Conquerer (Lovecraft Country's Jonathan Majors).
  Rudd, furrowing his ageless brow, has buffed his twinkly Everyguy appeal to an affable gleam, though it still seems vaguely impossible that this man is both a thieving mastermind and an Avenger of the highest order (the counterintuitive casting, one imagines, was the point). Newton makes for a generic sort of plucky movie teen, and actors like Murray and Corey Stoll, who returns as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket, have fun nibbling on the loony little morsels of dialogue they're given.
  The outlier in all these lighthearted shenanigans is Majors, an actor soon to be seen in the brawnier dramas Creed III and Magazine Dreams. Marked by scars that bisect his brow bone and spill down his cheeks like a trail of tears, his Kang is a Quantam Othello, and Iago, too: a tragic villain fearfully convinced of his own righteousness. That sometimes makes for a strange tonal fit in a film that aims so purely to entertain; waiter, why is there Shakespeare in my soup?
  But it's effective, too, even if nearly all of Kang's origin story goes unexplained — saved, no doubt, for the next uncountable sequels. Like most of the movies in this multiverse, Quantumania often alludes to other MCU incidents and characters without providing narrative training wheels for the wholly uninitiated or even the casual fan (though it's questionable how much that matters, if at all).

For those keeping track, Peyton Reed‘s “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantamania” marks the 31st Marvel Cinematic Universe film, the third standalone “Ant-Man” feature, and the first film in what is billed as the MCU’s “Phase Five.” And those are just the movie stats: For Marvel fans to fully enjoy (or, really, to fully understand) what’s at play in Reed’s film, they also need to be caught up on the brand’s copious television offerings. If you’re walking into “Quantumania,” you’re likely arriving with a lot of knowledge and plenty of expectations for what’s to come. While Reed and star Paul Rudd continue to mine plenty of laughs from the silliness of a superhero whose main powers include getting really big and really small and utilizing ants as his primary assistants (one thing to anticipate: plenty of “ants?” jokes), “Quantumania” suffers what’s become the classic MCU problem: It’s not content to focus on its eponymous superhero. As the first film in Phase Five, “Quantumania” is scarcely allowed to be its own thing, because it’s also tasked with introducing the big bad who will lord over the franchise for the foreseeable future. That’s a tough ask for a series that’s as lighthearted as the MCU gets. (Ants!) Said big bad — rising star Jonathan Majors — doesn’t disappoint, towering over “Quantumania” and its little ant friends with genuine pathos, pain, and fear, even if the most studied MCU scholars will likely be confused by what exactly his Kang the Conquerer wants and, uh, is. But cramming Majors’ Kang against Rudd’s Scott Lang (AKA Ant-Man), his plucky kid (Kathryn Newton as Cassie), his iron-willed partner (Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne), and her parents (Michael Douglas as Hank Pym and Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne) as they zip and zag through a tiny, “Star Wars”-influenced world doesn’t just feel confusing; it can feel outright mean. We start small, literally. Reed’s film opens with a flashback that takes place before the action of “Ant-Man and the Wasp” (yes, you read that correctly), landing us in the Quantum Realm (the subatomic level of our universe, a minuscule dimension) back when Janet was still stuck there. In our current timeline, Janet is back with her family after spending more than 30 years down in the QR, but she’s barely told them about her experience; this flashback fills in the blanks. For one thing, the QR is, well, pretty cool? Janet painted it as a terrifying wasteland in the prior “Ant-Man,” and other MCU entries have suggested it’s a brain-breaking hellhole, but here it looks colorful and trippy. These opening scenes only provide a glimpse of the vibrant world “down below,” complete with eye-popping space creatures and Janet’s little homestead. Soon, she’s joined by an unexpected visitor: A nameless man (Majors) crash-lands on her patch of land. Back in the “real” world in our “current” timeline (if your brain is smarting now, ohh, get ready), things are going Scott’s way, as Rudd gamely struts about his hometown of San Francisco and soaks in the accolades that come with being an Avenger (even if some people aren’t entirely sure which Avenger he is) and a newly minted bestselling author (his autobiography, of course). But while Scott is interested in the trappings of his heroic fame, Cassie is hellbent on actual heroism. Just like her dear old dad, she’s recently landed in jail (she was protecting some unhoused people from cops) and she’s got a deep interest in the possibilities of those damn super-powered Pym Particles. As the Langs settle into a cozy family dinner with the van Dyne and Pym clan, the full extent of Cassie’s passions becomes clear: With the help of Hank and Hope, she’s built a tiny machine that can communicate with the Quantum Realm. Hank couldn’t be more proud of this “subatomic Hubbell telescope,” but as a horrified Janet soon reveals, any connection with the QR is a dangerous one, as long as he is still there. Before we can glean any more information (an all-too-common problem in Jeff Loveness’ script) the five of them, plus Hank’s latest batch of super-smart ants, are shrunk down and sucked into the Quantum Realm via Cassie’s machine. Oops. Loveness uses said QR-sucking to divide the group — Cassie and Scott find each other, the ants head out to See You in Third Act, and Hope, Hank, and Janet are swiftly reunited — a clever way to cover a lot of ground and give everyone plenty to do. While the first act is beset by choppy edits that flip between the groups with little rhyme or reason, this world is not enthralling or wacky enough to hold our attention. True, we’ve never seen the Quantum Realm quite like this! — but how much is there to see? Scott and Cassie soon meet a band of QR refugees — how they exist is clearly a question for another time, or another movie — who include warrior Jentorra (Katy O’Brian), mindreader Quaz (William Jackson Harper), and jelly-bellied alien Veb (David Dastmalchian). Understandably, all are bothered by the arrival of tiny humans but they get really unhappy when they realize the kids know Janet. Elsewhere, Janet’s return to the Quantum Realm is met with joy (she seems very popular with some of those kooky creature pals) and outright fear (as a distracting Bill Murray tells us in a zany, bar-set sequence). When Janet left the QR before, we’re told, she also exited a massive rebellion against the evil Kang that —maybe? — she accidentally helped start in the first place. After that, everything is all lurching exposition (although the film could do with a whole lot more informative exposition) as the groups battle their way into an all-star showdown with Kang that will determine what happens to not just the QR, but to the multiverse itself. However inscrutable, Kang makes for a formidable villain: Majors delivers a powerhouse performance as the MCU’s scariest bad guy to date. (The actor has already signed on for at least two more MCU films, although we regret to tell you that they are not slated until two films into Phase Six. That means we’ve got seven more installments before we get the Kang movies.) To say that Kang is multifaceted is to put it mildly; his lust for victory, bloodshed, and ruling is unmatched (Thanos who?). It’s so pervasive that every iteration of Kang across the multiverse is bent on the same thing: conquering and cruelty. This iteration of Kang? Well, he’s a bit heartbreaking. Flashbacks revealing his bond with Janet show a complicated character capable of great empathy and intelligence, but when past Janet discovers who he really is (thanks to his “neuro-kinetic” multiverse-traveling spaceship), it’s clear he can never be unleashed upon the properly sized world again. In relatively small film that works best when it leans into kicky humor and wondrous creature design, that’s pretty heavy. It’s also the kind of mismatched sensibility that’s inevitable when a franchise must take the next seven (seven!) films into consideration. That’s a shame, because when Reed and Rudd and team lean into what makes Ant-Man so delightful, there’s plenty of small-scale entertainment to be had. Not every superheroic adventure needs to be about the fate of the universe — or, as this current run of MCU features tells us, the entire multiverse — but as long as this franchise demands everything everywhere all at once, the small, silly, sweet, and inventive film that “Quantumania” could have been won’t exist. Maybe the pictures should get small again; it might be the only way to save an MCU that seems dangerously close to getting too big to do anything but fail.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," I worked in a bookstore back in 2015 when Avengers: Age of Ultron was released. In fact, my employment there spanned pretty much the gap between The Avengers and its first sequel. I guess in hindsight that was all early days of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) phenomenon, but even at the time, it was the only franchise on which all of my coworkers made an effort to keep current. That was the appeal of the MCU at its height: It was something almost everyone cared about, even people who don’t really care about movies or comics. That’s why one of my coworkers’ reactions to Age of Ultron really bummed me out at the time. “Too long,” they said. “Too comic-booky.” The film’s weaknesses aside, of which there are many, it was always the critique that the film leaned too hard into its origins that got me thinking. I didn’t personally mind the idea of Ultron lifting a country into the sky and dropping it down like an asteroid. Cool shit! But admittedly, Ultron lacked the fleet, simple excitement of its predecessor, which mixed simple, fun characters into an easy-to-understand situation and let the story develop from their relationships. Later MCU movies managed to harness the simplicity of the first Avengers to incredible success … until the last few years. The post-Avengers: Endgame MCU has seen more overall product than its first three phases combined. Some of it has been great — Spider-Man: No Way Home, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Hawkeye — but the large majority has been a letdown. Thor: Love and Thunder was a bust, and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever was unable to overcome the burden of being an important entry in the larger MCU story. Several of the Disney+ shows started strong and ended with odd anticlimaxes or cliffhangers with no clear resolution. The most interesting new property of the bunch, Eternals, seems dead in the water. Into this glut of disappointing content comes Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, the third film about the titular heroes by director Peyton Reed. In classic MCU fashion, it’s a sequel to both Ant-Man & the Wasp and Avengers: Endgame, picking up on story threads laid down by previous films to launch the Ant-Man family on an adventure into the heart of the multiverse. Despite some fun family dynamics and an offbeat sense of humor that feels built to appeal only to real weirdos, Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania feels like a big misstep for the Ant-Man franchise and marks another frustrating entry for the larger MCU saga. Picking up from the previous movies: Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has become a famous Avenger. Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) is putting her family’s Pym Particle tech to charitable use. Her parents, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), are enjoying retirement. The Lang / van Dyne / Pym family is living its best life, but something remains missing for Scott — the five years he never got to spend with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), now a rebellious teenager who grew up a lot during the time between Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. She also happens to be a super-genius, and an invention she concocted to map the Quantum Realm quickly pulls her and her family into a subatomic, super-scientific adventure filled with bizarre beasties and a deadly new adversary: Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who is being billed as the next Thanos-level overarching threat for the broader franchise. The trailers pitch Quantumania as a story about Scott being threatened into conducting a heist on behalf of Kang to save Cassie’s life. That’s not really the case. In fact, there isn’t much of a story here. The strength of Ant-Man & the Wasp (the successful entry in the Ant-Man trilogy) was how a small-scale tale felt significant due to what it meant for its characters. That film feels small, even cheap at times, but coasts to the finish line with clever gags and a great ensemble. Quantumania has the opposite problem: It feels small, even cheap at times, but is light on humor and most of the cast has little to actually do. By the third act, the family-comedy trappings have mostly fallen away, leaving a schematic rebellion plot that feels like a low-grade ripoff of Thor: Ragnarok. I suppose it seems like my knives are out for Quantumania, so before I dive into the worst aspect of the film, let me say a few kind words: The first act is pretty sweet, introducing a status quo for the characters that implies a more interesting story than we get. Once they reach the Quantum Realm, there are a lot of really cool alien designs. Some of the visuals look good (others look … less than good). I liked the score. The contours of an emotional journey are present: Scott’s desire to bond with Cassie and Hope’s frustration at her mother’s unwillingness to discuss the past are both fertile soil, but they never drive the action. Like pretty much everything else in the movie, it’s all dealt with primarily through dialogue. Still … I like Cassie and Scott, and I want to see more of them. Hank Pym also has a fun role that worked for me and catered to my taste for baffling comic-book super-science. Frankly, the biggest issue with Quantumania is the one aspect everyone else seems to be hailing as a success — the introduction of multiversal villain Kang. It was a ballsy move for Marvel to try to introduce their new “big bad” up front. One reason Thanos worked so well is that he was basically absent for a decade before the MCU braintrust really figured out how to incorporate him and then introduced him in a film where he was the main character. Kang, on the other hand, is supposed to be multiple versions of the same genius scientist locked in a war with other versions of himself. This aspect — like the one seen in Loki — is simply one of an infinite number. We know this because he explains the premise of his secret war in both the show and this film. Endlessly. The sheer amount of exposition and build-up for Kang contrasts with his actual emotional role in the film, which is zero. Zero. The character’s main relationship exists only in a flashback that arrives far too late in the film and makes his villainy too explicit too quickly. His first meeting with Ant-Man repeats the mistake. Majors’ approach to this version of Kang is regal, manipulative and cruel, but he’s so quick to violence and anger that we never grow to like him, much less understand him on a level beyond “Oh, wow, there’s a multiversal war!” The question the film tries to ask is whether defeating one Kang is worth the price of many more of them descending out of eternity to destroy the main MCU timeline. It’s an idea that, again, speaks to my sci-fi brain, but it doesn’t speak to my heart or the heart of this particular film. It’s a lot of lore dumping in a film and sub-franchise that has always coasted by on its level of genuine sweetness. The mixture does not set. I fear it’s like Age of Ultron all over again. Too corny. Too comic-booky. That’s not the strength of the MCU, and it needs some strength right now to regain momentum lost with all these lesser sequels to their best films. I wish I had more good to say about Quantumania. The first half really worked for me. These are good characters, and their family dynamics are unique in superhero cinema, but it all gets swept away in a back half that doesn’t do justice to the authentic emotions of being lost with your loved ones. Like the Phase 4 movies, the actual grace note of the ending comes before a final scene that explicitly sets up more movies, which used to be reserved for post-credits stuff; in fact, there are two post-credits here, promising more of what didn’t really work this time. Ah, well."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," The Ant-Man movies have long been the red-headed stepchild of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Routinely lost among the mythos-shattering scramble of Infinity Stones, space gods, and multiversal threats, Scott Lang’s stand-alone shrinking adventures have always played in the sidelines. But the sidelines - outside of his ironically pivotal role in Avengers: Endgame - have also been where Ant-Man and his Pym Particles thrived most: providing fleet, energetic reprieves from the crushing burden of carving out an interconnected comic book universe. No one pretends they’re high art, but the Ant-Man series’ refreshing self-awareness of its brand of light entertainment has always been its biggest strength. So what happens when it’s all ejected to make it the lynchpin of the MCU’s next galaxies-spanning threat? Well, it certainly feels like replacing the low-stakes caper energy of the Ant-Man movies with tedious, wheel-spinning teases of what comes next is a grave miscalculation.  Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is in a rut. Despite being one of the Avengers that saved the universe from Thanos, he’s been stuck hocking his memoir and going through the motions. His partner Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) has transformed Pym Technologies into a philanthropic powerhouse, while his daughter Cassie (now played by Kathryn Newton) has taken on the mantle of “looking after the little guy” with her own brand of activism. Desperate to make up for lost time, with his daughter now five years older having never been “blipped,” Scott takes an interest in Cassie’s secret science project: building a Quantum Realm beacon with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) much to the dismay of Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). It isn’t before long that Janet’s fears of tampering with the Quantum Realm - where she was stranded for decades before the events of Ant-Man and the Wasp - become reality: a wayward signal triggers a laboratory mishap that sucks the entire group of heroes into the strange, dangerous netherworld. Newly marooned, Scott and his family navigate the inhospitable environment while grappling with Janet’s secret past, itself inextricably linked to the MCU’s newest big bad: a multiversal tyrant named Kang (Jonathan Majors). With Quantumania, it shouldn’t be a surprise that Marvel’s signature, assembly-line CGI is front-and-center. Inexplicably dim and muddy, Ant-Man’s very own journey into mystery is a far cry from the weird, eye-popping exercise in bombast it should be. An entire zany world reduced to brown and dark orange hues, it’s Marvel’s stubborn allergy to color and contrast writ large. Even worse, Quantumania’s turgid visuals only highlight one of its biggest problems: Scott Lang in the Quantum Realm just isn’t that interesting. The coolest thing about the Ant-Man movies is when they recontextualize the scale of everyday objects that we’re all familiar with. Collisions with Thomas the Tank Engine, running alongside the edge of a kitchen knife, being swept away by a bathtub’s faucet - Quantumania’s predecessors understood the simple pleasures of a shrinking and growing superhero in relatable spaces, but when you change Ant-Man’s environment to sludgy, indecipherable alien CGI, it all becomes meaningless and - even worse - boring. Narratively, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania never quite has a handle on what it wants to be. Overstuffed with tired performances from Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, and even newcomer Kathryn Newton, its story doesn’t have the conviction to decide among its myriad paths: Its family drama, uninspired rebellion yarn, and Phase Five burdens stretch it past its breaking point. And while nothing really adds up inside this Quantum Realm adventure, it’s Jonathan Majors who carries the entire film on his back; playing in an entire league of his own, he puts on the big boy villain pants with a pained pathos and genuine menace. Janet’s hidden past with Kang - glimpses of which are all too fleeting - is hands-down the best thing about the movie, but even Majors’ tour-de-force buckles under the Marvel mandate to tease the future. By the time Quantumania’s third act fizzles away with yet another big beam battle, Phase Five already feels like a tiresome treadmill, and even the words ""Kang will return” don’t  muster much optimism."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," Prepare to be slammed by special effects, hammered by an ear-battering soundtrack. Oh, and you’ll be left mewling for mercy after an onslaught of Truly Bad Dialogue.  Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), aka Ant-Man, the hero. And Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), aka The Wasp, the Ant guy’s girlfriend and co-superhero. Also Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), aka the original Wasp. And Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet’s husband. And Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), aka Peanut, Scott’s teenage genius daughter. Conjured up by the feverishly creative and also enormously vast army of special-effects worker bees (the end credit crawl crawls along at close to 10 minutes to list all their names), it’s a place of bright swirly lights, undulating tentacles, cloaked Jawa people and … huh? How did they get in there?  The “Star Wars” Force is strong in this one. There is even a Cantina scene. A very long riff on the original. Full of all kinds of odd creatures. Oh look over there. It’s a talking broccoli stalk. Back at the start, in 2015’s “Ant-Man,” when the character was introduced, Scott was a likable human-scaled guy. A good-hearted convict who cherished his then preteen daughter and wanted to go straight. No super powers until he was outfitted with the insta-shrink ant suit invented by Dr. Pym.  Now, several pictures later, including his appearances in the final “Avengers” movies, Scott has gotten kind of full of himself.  Family is a big deal in the “Ant” movies, though a contentious one. Scott was an absent dad for a lot of Cassie’s early years, having been in jail for his thieveries, a fact she reminds him of often. A similar guilt-tinged relationship exists between daughter Hope and mother Janet. The mom was absent, lost for 30 years in the Quantum Realm, and so missed her child’s growing-up. Squabbling ensues. And she’s been pretty cagey about what went on down there. Hint: It involves a sleazy character played by Bill Murray. ”I had needs,” Janet tells her scandalized daughter and husband. Janet also has a history with Kang, and worked to stymie his malevolent plans. That causes resentment, which drives Kang to menace her and her family. Much overly busy CG-fueled crashing and banging takes place, and that’s essentially the plot.  “Kang will return,” a title card promises (or maybe threatens) at the end. But of course he will. The Marvel universe will go on forever. With Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Jonathan Majors, Kathryn Newton, Bill Murray, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas. Directed by Peyton Reed from a screenplay by Jeff Loveness. 125 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence/action and language. Opens Feb. 16 at multiple theaters."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Look, it was cute how screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeeley gave Paul Rudd’s street-level hero Ant-Man something useful to do in Avengers: Endgame. His Pym particles and the gobbledegook of the vaunted Quantum Realm boosted the affable guy who was limited to his size changes that come in handy in a brawl. Delegating time travel duties to Scott Lang made Ant-Man semi-important and sold a few more action figures with different uniforms, but that’s it. In a way, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is almost self-aware of that fact. Post-Endgame, Scott is an inactive Avenger with no attempts to work as a crimefighter, and couldn’t be more comfortable with that state. He has become Marvel’s own “San Francisco Treat,” living off the shimmer of victorious legacy described in a voiceover set to John Sebastian’s “Welcome Back.” Scott enjoys complementary coffees, honors from Baskin Robbins, and regales his adoring public with appearances, selfies, and bookstore readings of his autobiography “Look Out for the Little Guy. Meanwhile, his teenage daughter Cassie (aged up to be played by Freaky’s Kathryn Newton) is really the one living up to that book’s title and her father’s former example. She is doing something that matters. Supported by Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) in her endeavors, Cassie has rung up another arrest moonlighting with her own Pym tech to interject herself in local fights for good causes against the authorities. When Scott tries to scold her for these actions, he doesn’t have a leg to stand on as the guy who used to do the same, prison trips and all. So far, so good, right? Staying local and rooted in family dynamics would make for an ideal Ant-Man movie and an escalator out of the grief management arcs of Phase 4, no? Wrong. Unfortunately, with a cinematic universe spiraling in a zillion rudderless directions of multiverse lunacy, the Marvel machine will not stand for that. Enlisting awards show and Rick and Morty writer Jeff Loveness (bask in that pedigree), Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania reaches so poorly with attempted relevancy.  Loveness, returning series director Peyton Reed, and the studio braintrust sat down and decided to let Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania introduce the portended Phase 5 villain Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors… but not really, though, because he already showed up in the Loki TV series. Oh, but it’s a different Kang than that one? Of course. Welcome back to the crutches of overplayed multiverse angles. As it turns out, “He Who Remains” has crossed paths with the Ant-Man family before. In old history spun back in the first scene and continuing later, Janet encountered an exiled Kang during her three decades of confinement to the Quantum Realm. They saved each other’s lives and became confidantes for a time while trying to repair his ship. When Janet discovered his true monstrous intentions, she was rescued back to Earth, leaving the Quantum Realm to a re-powered Kang primed to take over. Naturally, Janet has never spoken of her lost time in the Quantum Realm with her family, meaning no warnings exist about this massive threat. When probed, the shaken woman parries with “We’ll talk later,” often accompanied by, before or after, “I can’t talk about it right now.” When Cassie’s basement experiments to map and communicate the Quantum Realm trigger a portal that pulls everyone down into the subatomic universe, Janet’s dialogue becomes contagious and those same two lines of the-adults-are-talking deflection continue over and over again. Guess what? They never talk about it later. At some point, that’s not PTSD character shading in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. That’s lazy screenwriting bleeding through, pretending to save important conversations for later. Returning to the Quantum Realm, Janet is back in her element only to find a completely different landscape of political and territorial control dominated by Kang. The Lang-Pym-Van Dyne gang take on Cassie’s fighting spirit to befriend a rag-tag group of alien rainbow revolutionaries (I dare you to remember any of their names after you walk out of the theater) in hopes of dethroning Kang, his top lieutenant of MODOK (played by a casting surprise), his armies, and living to tell about it. Conveniently, the Pym Particle technology is precisely what the tyrant needs to spring himself from the Quantum Realm.  Thank goodness for Jonathan Majors. Give him all the #KangGang fans he can amass. Not only does the upcoming Creed III opponent fill the part of a heavyweight from a beefy screen presence standpoint, but he speaks and emotes the soliloquies of the role perfectly. Majors is brilliant with modulations of volume, pause, inflection, and gazes to make Kang enigmatic and squeeze a weak script for every drop of weight he can. Taking a cue from President Theodore Roosevelt’s foreign policy of “speak softly and carry a big stick,” you hang on his every word with trepidation.  Like Christian Bale and other actors of ponderousness before him, Majors is here in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania to be as serious as a heart attack. No one else, sadly, can keep up. Kang is there foretelling prophecies of “You still can’t see it” and “It’s never over.” All the movie can do to respond with shrug and more tabled missing meanings of explanations that never arrive. Regrettably, Paul Rudd occupies that fluffed side of the balance. Kathryn Newton has a spark or two, but pitfalls are reduced in a hurry to a damsel that needs her dad to save her. Somehow, even Rudd’s sterling Everyman charisma is smudged and dulled by the parade of green screen mattes and surrounding creature created by the VFX team of supervisor Jesse James Chisholm (Captain Marvel) and producer Fiona Campbell Westgate (The Suicide Squad). When you’re already subatomic, the shrinking fun of big and small fighting moves loses its effect in an obscure aesthetic setting of borderline indecipherable weirdness. All in all, how is something that is supposed to be small become something that is way, way, way too much? The reason goes back to the notion of actions mattering. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania begs for excuses to make a group of characters who were plenty engaging in their own world matter in a splintered multiverse that has blown past its many containers. To do so with stakes lighter than Cool Whip is not how to achieve pertinent purpose. Let the little guy stay the little guy.

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," 
	Now, though, with “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” the “Ant-Man” series has gone Full Marvel. The new movie takes place almost entirely in the Quantum Realm, a mutating sub-atomic sphere that exists outside our space-time continuum. It’s essentially an anything-goes FX playground that resembles a psychedelic album cover crossed with a 21st-century update of “Fantastic Voyage” (lots of things that look like corpuscles). What it feels like, most directly, is a planet from one of the later “Star Wars” films, with a few old-school Cantina vibes. (You could make a case that the George Lucas prequels represented the takeover of “Star Wars” by the Cantina.) 
	Reed, at the same time, is out to conjure the deadly gravitas of an “Avengers” epic. Vast populations, whole strands of the multiverse, are at stake. Yet since “Quantumania” claims to be a film about the manipulation of matter, we should probably ask: With everything going on in this movie, does any of it actually matter? 
	Yes and no. “Quantumania” is a state-of-the-art exercise in world-building, and in the neverending fantasy world (namely, ours) that was built by J.R.R. Tolkien and Dungeons & Dragons and “Star Wars” and “Harry Potter” and sandbox video games and Lego assembly kits that can number 10,000 pieces, it’s worth noting how axiomatic it is that when people today use the phrase “world-building,” they mean it as a high compliment. Another world! Another fun place for us to play in! 
	“Quantumania” is fun, as well as bedazzling, relentless and numbing, then fun again just when you think you’ve had enough; all of that gets mashed together. The Marvel films have never pretended to be stand-alone entities, yet I’ve rarely encountered a Marvel adventure that’s this busy with a do-or-die saving-the-cosmos plot that feels this much like it exists simply to set up the next dozen chapters of something. But that’s what happens when you’re launching Phase 5 of the Marvel takeover of movie entertainment. “Quantumania” is no cheat (it sucks you in, hooks your eyeballs, wrings you out), but if this is what Phase 5 looks like, God save us from Phases 6, 7 and 8. 
	Scott’s science-prodigy daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), now a plucky young woman of 18, has built some sort of meta telescope in the basement. Within minutes, the device sucks everyone to the Quantum Realm — Scott and Cassie, along with Scott’s bug-superhero partner and paramour, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), and Hope’s parents, the crusty physicist and former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and the original Wasp, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), who in the previous film was rescued after having spent 30 years down there. It turns out that she was doing more than passing the time watching Netflix. She was there when Kang first showed up as a stranded traveler — but, in fact, he was already an exile who’d been kicked to the Quantum Realm to halt his path of destruction. Janet blew up the core of Kang’s quantum device, which saved the multiverse. But she’s still regarded by the rebels with mistrust. And Kang hasn’t gone away; his designs have just been put on hold. 
	Rudd’s Scott, introduced by John Sebastian’s “Welcome Back, Kotter” theme, is presented as a complacent celebrity superhero who needs to be goosed into action. There’s a terrific scene in which he gets replicated and has to face down — and ultimately work with — a horde of his multiple selves. The scene allows Rudd to get seriously addled, which is when he’s at his best in “Quantumania.” But when Scott, now a giant version of himself, trashes Kang’s fascist metropolis like Godzilla, all I could think was: What, exactly, are the rules here? The script, by former “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and “Rick and Morty” writer Jeff Loveness, is making up the rules as it goes along, which is why “Quantumania” whisks you through its visually zapping action without generating any real investment in it. In a way, the ultimate investment is offscreen: Will the film successfully launch Phase 5? To even wonder about the answer is to miss that the only real conqueror in “Quantumania” is the MCU."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," The post-Endgame MCU has been dealing with a bit of turbulence. Phase 4 came and went with a couple of gems, like Spider-Man: No Way Home an Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, but mostly middling efforts such as Black Widow and Eternals. A big part of the problem is that so much time was spent establishing the Multiverse, and weaving in eight (!!!) television shows that defining a singlular threat was nearly impossible. Well, that changes with the official kickoff to Phase 5, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, which finally gives Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror his moment to shine. Kang is one of a few highlights in a sluggish but entertaining film that feels too much like a set-up for future projects, and not like the possible finale to Ant-Man’s solo franchise. Paul Rudd’s diminutive Avenger deserves better than a story where Ant-Man is merely a passenger along for the ride. Scott Lang is riding high after the events of Endgame and his pivotal role in Thanos’ defeat. He’s written a book, Look Out for the Little Guy!, and is soaking in the adulation of the masses. But he’s also got daughter problems. Following the five-year “blip”, Cassie (Kathryn Newton) is now a rebellious and brilliant teen. She’s gotten used to fighting the good fight on her own, and isn’t afraid to use the dangerous Pym Particles to do it. With the help of Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie has developed a device that connects to the Quantum Realm, the microscopic universe Scott was sucked into in the first movie. Only Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) knows how deadly that place truly is, but she warns them about it too late. An accident zaps all of them down into the Quantum Realm, which turns out to be anything but the desolate place Janet claimed it to be. The depiction of the Quantum Realm is the first sign that something is lacking in Quantumania. While it is colorful, full of weird creatures that resemble the marketplace scene in Hellboy II: The Golden Army, it lacks a distinct personality. Given his love for the Fantastic Four and long-held desire to direct that upcoming movie, you’d expect that director Peyton Reed would put more energy into making the Quantum Realm feel special, and not like it was cribbed from a variety of other sci-fi films. Bill Murray shows up as a former associate of Janet’s, and he temporarily ends a rut that finds her, Hank, and Hope aimlessly looking for a way back home. Separated from the others, Scott and Cassie get some father/daughter bonding time as they find themselves in the middle of a civil war. The people of the Quantum Realm are facing extinction at the hands of Kang the Conqueror, whose technology is so far advanced nobody can understand it. Kang is a different type of villain than Thanos, and it’s refreshing to see the MCU with a new kind of threat. Arguably the most comics accurate villain Marvel has give us yet, Kang is brilliant, brutal, demonstrative, and arrogant. He speaks with the authority of someone who not only controls time, but understands it. He sees the widest possible picture. Majors, who has been packing on the muscle for a variety of physically-demanding roles, is perfectly cast as the intimidating Kang. He lends the role the gravitas that it needs to be taken seriously, even when large chunks of the film are very silly. On equal footing with Majors, the ageless Paul Rudd proves again that nobody could’ve been better-suited to play Scott Lang. His scenes with Kathryn Newton are great, especially as Scott, who began all of this as a petty thief, imparts his heroic wisdon on his daughter. We’re seeing the beginnings of Cassie as a future hero, possibly an Avenger, and her arc is believable and fun to watch. With Janet taking on an outsized role here, it does sideline Hope, Hank, and even Scott to some degree. There are a ton of characters, including many, often humorous, rebel fighters to account for. Oh, and one MODOK. His appearance, especially in light of the popular animated series with Patton Oswalt, is sure to be divisive. It’s hard to shake the Empire Strikes Back and Ready Player One vibes when everything starts to ramp up to a conclusion. But the final battle, which finds the entire….Ant Family (???) united as a force for the first time, is incredible and gives everyone their moment to be the hero. Ant-Man, like the franchise he’s been at the center of, has come a long way. No longer just a cute, somewhat tangential corner of the MCU, Ant-Man is now a key piece of the puzzle from which everything must build. But Scott Lang emerges more than ever the underdog everyman we love to root for, and Kang as the ultimate threat to end all threats. In terms of scale and importance, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an enormous step forward, but there are some growing pains that come along with it."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly reprise their roles as the titular characters in this latest Marvel offering, with Jonathan Majors playing a genuinely scary villain.  
	Although this film features some laughs — many of them revolving around the visually hilarious, homicidal organism MODOK (more on that later) — humor is generally in shorter supply. Which is probably appropriate for a film featuring one of Marvel’s scariest-ever villains in the form of Kang the Conqueror (a truly fearsome Jonathan Majors, instantly establishing a career annuity) and a potential cataclysm involving … actually, I don’t know what, to be honest. I just know that it’s really, really, bad, and that between the Multiverse and the Quantum Realm, you practically need an advanced physics degree to figure out what the hell is going on in Marvel films these days. 
	The extended family’s contentment is soon shattered when they all get accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm as a result of unfortunate scientific tinkering by Cassie, who is obviously following in her father’s footsteps. While there, Janet gets reunited with some old friends, including the smarmy but menacing Lord Krylar (Bill Murray, doing the Bill Murray thing), with whom she apparently had some sort of fling, much to Hank’s consternation. Janet also has a history with Kang, whom she previously prevented from escaping the Realm and who really wants to get out now. Because, how else is he eventually going to go up against the Avengers? 
	It’s frustrating to see the main characters separated into various groups for long stretches of the film, but Lilly’s Wasp has plenty of moments to shine and Douglas seems to be thoroughly enjoying playing bemused — as when Hank accurately observes about one particularly odd Quantum Realm creature, “Holy shit, that guy looks like broccoli!” (It’s not a line to rival Gordan Gekko’s “Greed, for lack of a better word, is good,” but it’s pretty funny.) And Pfeiffer is terrific in her expanded role, given the opportunity to be a badass heroine and making the most of it. 
	But it’s Majors who brings real gravitas to the proceedings. While it’s not surprising that the actor’s imposing physicality perfectly suits his iconic villainous character, he also invests his performance with such an arrestingly quiet stillness and ambivalence that you’re on edge every moment he’s onscreen. 
	Still, he’s not the villain who steals the picture. That would be MODOK, Kang’s “Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing,” who looks like a giant head in a tiny body and is played by a former Ant-Man actor not listed in the film’s credits. The other characters’ reactions upon first encountering the bizarre creature are priceless, and so is the saying inspired by him, which ultimately serves as the film’s unofficial motto: “It’s never too late to stop being a dick.” Which, for Marvel, is as profound as it gets."

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," Marvel movies tend to live or die on their villains. Remember Thanos? Of course you do, his menacing, purple mug made Avengers: Endgame unmissable. But what about Iron Man 2‘s Ivan Vanko? No, us neither. Yon-Rogg in Captain Marvel? Utterly forgettable. The point is, if you’re making a comic book blockbuster and you want to take on James Cameron at the box office, get a good baddie. In Jonathan Majors’ muscly brute Kang, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania has one of the best. This third adventure for Paul Rudd’s diminutive superhero takes us into the weird and wacky world of the Quantum Realm. Sucked inside when a science experiment goes wrong, Scott Lang (aka the incredible shrinking Ant-Man) and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), get separated from the rest of their family. That’s Scott’s partner Hope Van Dyne aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and her physics genius parents Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Luckily, Janet’s been here before – she once spent 30 years trapped in the QR before escaping – and tells the others about any dangerous traps or alien mercenaries to avoid. What she doesn’t tell them is that Kang, a mysterious, all-powerful being bent on destroying the universe, is her nemesis. And now she’s returned to his kingdom, which he rules with a leather-gloved iron fist, he’s hellbent on revenge. To say any more would spoil the film, but rest assured this is top-drawer MCU. Previous Ant-Man films felt slight compared to their bigger Avengers brothers, and even director Peyton Reed concedes the action-comedies were only “fun little palate cleansers”. Quantumania is different. Much darker in tone and more impactful to the franchise’s overarching narrative, Lang’s psychedelic sojourn has a weightier feel to it that’s more in keeping with the Russo Brothers’ climactic epics Infinity War and Endgame. For starters, there’s a lot more stuff. Home to a strange array of quirky “quantum people” – martians made out of broccoli, Bill Murray’s creepy space-lord, a warrior who shoots lasers out of his face made of stars – the new intergalactic location seems to have very few actual rules. Can’t understand the regional dialect? Here, drink this gloopy extraterrestrial’s blood and instantly become a polyglot. Don’t know how to fly a rocket ship? Plug your arms into the controls and pilot by brainpower. There’s more than a whiff of Star Wars about the place (hey there, cantina), but with enough reinvention to make it all fresh and very, very fun. And then there’s Kang. Blessed with the ability to bend the cosmos to his will (“time is not what you think it is”), Majors’ cool yet commanding tyrant dominates every scene he’s in. Whether it’s quelling dissent with a single stare or flipping a finger to dispatch his enemies, Kang has an intimidating presence not unlike Darth Vader. In fact, he’s so compelling that after his initial introduction about half-way through Quantumania, the other characters seem less interesting by comparison. Rudd and Lilly might be first-billed on the poster, but this is undeniably the Majors show – did Marvel just find its next great villain?"
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," LOS ANGELES, Feb. 14 (UPI) -- Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, in theaters Friday, is an odd miscalculation of how to apply this hero to different genres. Both the sci-fi and the comedy of the film fundamentally misunderstand the genres in which they are dabbling. Cassie has been working on Quantum Science with Hank (Michael Douglas) and Hope (Evangeline Lily). An accident sends them all to the Quantum Realm-- Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), too.
 Instead of bringing comic books to life, Quantumania turns live-action into comic books. Visual effects are a given with fantastic superhero movies, but when everything surrounding the actors is animated, nothing is tangible. No matter how creative the artists working behind the scenes are, the Quantum Realm is just different versions of a blank void. Compare it to Avatar's Pandora, which still feels like a real planet, even though it is also created entirely digitally. When sequences fill the entire IMAX frame, the Quantum Realm can envelop the audience. That's because most normal sequences still look like the usual computer-animated backgrounds in modern blockbusters. Scott and Cassie are separated from Hank, Janet and Hope in the Quantum Realm. Scott and Cassie have to ingest quantum material to understand the residents, but everyone Hank, Janet and Hope meet already speaks to them in English. Everyone in the Quantum Realm also shoots laser guns like Star Wars and Star Trek. The humans also visit the Quantum Realm's version of an alien cantina, so it's just a remix of the same formula. It would be like if Crocodile Dundee went to Mars instead of New York. The culture shock would cease to be humorous when anybody from Earth would be out of place there. Both parties encounter groups of people who deliver exposition about what danger they're in and why the Quantum Realm is in the state it is. Janet actually met Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors) when she was stuck in the Quantum Realm in previous movies, but don't worry, every character in Quantumania explains why he's bad. Majors makes the most of Kang -- persuasive and calmly threatening. He's still just another bad guy who wants something that the heroes have to stop him from obtaining. Ant-Man and Wasp's powers feel particularly irrelevant in the Quantum Realm. They can shrink and grow, which has advantages in the physical world, but it's all relative in the Quantum Realm. There's plenty of shrinking and growing to give the fans what they want, but there are no stakes. If the Quantum Realm is the subatomic universe, nothing is normal size there. Since Ant-Man appeared in Endgame and Captain America: Civil War, maybe his solo movies should just be Ant-Man movies. A generic ""superhero saves the city"" movie would be preferable to this frustrating attempt at sci-fi and metaphysics.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," With Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Marvel has ushered in the so-called fifth phase of its (infinite?) conveyer belt of superhero media. Supposedly, the distinction is important. Post-Quantumania, though, it seems like it’d be far more helpful to label the next batch of Marvel films and TV shows as “the Jonathan Majors phase”. He’s just that good. Majors – of TV’s Lovecraft Country and one of the stars of the forthcoming Creed III – isn’t entirely new to the MCU, having popped up at the end of Disney Plus’s Loki, where he offered Tom Hiddleston’s trickster god a few portentous warnings of what’s to come. But Quantumania offers us Majors’s proper introduction as Marvel’s new “big bad”: a mysterious time traveller named Kang the Conqueror. Or Kangs the Conquerors, to get technical, since the franchise’s new obsession with multiverses means we’ve been promised multiple Kangs from multiple timelines down the line. Quantumania, really, is a Kang film. Any and all Ant-Man-related hijinks, as dorky and good-natured as they might be, are basically an afterthought. While these superhero franchises have constantly threatened to swallow the careers of promising young actors whole, forever tying their reputations to multi-film deals and spandex costumes, Majors has pulled off the seemingly impossible. It’s as if he’s forced Marvel to orbit around the force of his own charisma. He delivers dry-as-Weetabix dialogue about timelines and variants with such solemnity, you’d be fooled into thinking he was talking about something actually real. He manifests threat without the helping hand of being CGI, purple and enormous, like Josh Brolin’s Thanos (although he does turn blue when he’s in fight mode, as a nod to his comic book counterpart). And, unlike many a Marvel villain of late, he’s enigmatic without having some tragic justification for his bad deeds. He’s basically Tilda Swinton as Narnia’s White Witch, dangling that all-too-tempting Turkish Delight in front of the audience’s faces. You sort of want to root for him, if only because he’s just very, very cool. Kang’s adversaries here, and the film’s actual protagonists, are a whole family unit of bug-based heroes. There’s Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton, new to the MCU and with just the right springy energy to match Rudd). Then there’s his partner, Hope van Dyne aka Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), and her parents (Michael Douglas’s Hank and Michelle Pfeiffer’s Janet). All five find themselves trapped in the Quantum Realm – essentially a subatomic dimension visited by those who can shrink themselves – after one of Cassie’s gadgets goes awry, only to find the place under the spell of a fairly resentful, extremely power-hungry Kang. The Quantum Realm has featured briefly in past MCU installments, but here it’s depicted as a pseudo-Star Wars world filtered through the imagination of screenwriter Jeff Loveness, a former writer on the animated comedy series Rick and Morty. Marvel has always benefited from indulging its cosmic side, drawing particularly from the legacies of great comic book storytellers such as Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and Jim Starlin. That was true when, back in 2014, James Gunn swept in to add a dose of irreverence to the series with Guardians of the Galaxy. It’s even truer now, when the overwhelming mass of recent Marvel projects (18 in the past two years) means that a distinct visual identity is a matter of desperation more than desire. Thankfully, Quantumania coughs up a decent amount of the mania promised in its title – it’s done a far better job, at least, than last year’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which was miserably sane. There are horses with slug heads. A socially awkward gelatinous blob voiced by actor David Dastmalchian. A sort of fleshy Humpty-Dumpty/human Babybel named MODOK (Mechanised Organism Designed Only for Killing). At one point, Michael Douglas drives a spaceship with gloopy, tube-like controls that make it look like he’s trying to impregnate a cow with both hands. All in all – particularly when balanced against the weightiness of Majors’s performance – Quantumania nicely hits the mark: it’s goofy, but goofy to just the right degree."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Something big is happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, albeit on an infinitesimal scale. Quantumania is the third film in the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced-dad ex-con with an incredible shrinking suit, but the first film in Phase Five of the MCU’s overarching, 31-movies-20-TV-shows-and-counting narrative. And that’s significant. Even if it would take an advanced degree in molecular physics to work through the implications. Far easier to focus on this sunny day in San Francisco, where Scott (Rudd) and the rest of the beautifully blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family are living out their happy post-Blip lives. That is until some teen tinkering with a MacGuffin machine gets them sucked into the subatomic “Quantum Realm”. What does that mean? For one, it means more screen time with Michelle Pfeiffer who, as OG quantum-explorer Janet van Dyne, does an excellent job of grounding all the wacky sci-fi in emotional reality. She’s just a guilt-ridden working mom who hopes keeping her own past traumas hidden will protect her family (it won’t. It never does). The Quantum Realm, with its micro-fauna forests and pulsating luminescent wildlife is absolutely worth a visit. Trailer-prompted comparisons with Star Wars prove neither unwarranted, nor off-putting, but this extended stay does deprive us of some intrinsic Ant-Man movie pleasures: there are no familiar, everyday objects here to size up or down. (Remember when Ant-man rode a flatbed truck like a skateboard? Classic.) So whatever weird, but surprisingly common, miniaturist kink it is that makes “smol” sights appeal goes achingly unsatisfied. Never forget that Honey I Shrunk the Kids made $222m at the international box office. There’s also no place for favourite side characters such as Randall Park’s Agent Woo (he gets a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it-cameo) or Lang’s erstwhile cellmate Luis (Michael Peña) with his heist-planning hijinks and iconic, long-winded anecdotes. All must make way for the much-anticipated entrance of Phase Five’s new Big Bad, Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors. Which brings us to the question with major implications for your next few multiplex trips: does Kang bang? Why yes, he does. Majors brings the same emotionally intense it-boy energy of Adam Driver in The Force Awakens. Note how his eyes are often watery with empathy for his victims, even as he throttles them. In his more wistful moments Kang would surely understand the main misgiving with this efficient movie product: the MCU marches inexorably onwards, through “phases” and “sagas”, but what’s the point if there’s no time to pause, reflect and enjoy a joke with old friends?"
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," Director: Peyton Reed
Summary: Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne, along with Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne, explore the Quantum Realm, where they interact with strange creatures and embark on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they thought was possible. The thing that has made the Marvel Cinematic Universe a lasting presence heading into its second decade is the diversity of genre and the diversity of tone. That and focusing on the characters while leaving the worldbuilding to the margins has kept this engine going. Still, after Avengers: Endgame, it has become more and more apparent that the studio doesn't quite know how to make the magic happen again. The common thing that nearly all of phase four has had is that nearly all of the films and several of the shows are varying levels of a mess. Sometimes that mess doesn't get in the way that much, and sometimes it kneecaps an entire production, but nearly all of them are floundering. While that can be seen in all the films, it has never been more apparent than Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania because the only moments where this feels like an Ant-Man film are when Scott is walking through San Francisco narrating his life. While the film, which lacks any semblance of a structure of any kind, let alone a three-act installation, it doesn't take long to get the ball rolling.  As a result, nearly all the runtime is spent in the Quantum Realm. While aspects of it are wonderfully realized, all too much of this world looks like any other alien civilization that we have seen before.  And unfortunately, the film blows by the moments that hint at something more without much lingering on them. It feels like a faint photocopy of a world where the shining moments of far-future Marvel movies stagnate beneath the bewildering plot, weird script, and general mess that doesn't come together.  This movie is Stagnant above all. A lot is going on in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, and to get into various plot points would be varying levels of spoilers.  But the Ant-Man movies have always been focused on the family dynamics of the characters, and that just isn't here. There is a plot point that the trailers and the marketing have talked about that isn't touched on in the movie at all, and it is a massive missed opportunity for this series. These films were different from the other Marvel films because all of these people, Scott, Hope, Cassie, are just people. No one has any superpowers or Tony Stark-level wealthand everything that they are comes from within. However, that human element is drowning in the VFX and the story that is struggling to figure out what is important and what isn't. The bright spots all come from the actors. This is the most we've seen from Michelle Pfieffer, and while she doesn't get nearly enough badass scenes, they also don't waste her either. They are involved in nearly everything that happens on screen and seeing the two of them interact is great to watch. Michael Douglas is still not nearly enough of an asshole to be a believable Hank Pym, but that isn't where these movies are going, so it's fine. If anyone gets the shaft this time around, it's Evangeline Lilly as Hope. This movie might be called Ant-Man and the Wasp, but the Wasp feels remarkably lacking compared to the previous film. The heart of these films has always been and will always be Scott and Cassie, and it's nice to see Cassie out there doing her own thing. Kathryn Newton gets saddled with the role of ""bumbling kid who has no idea what she's doing"" when it comes to her suit and the powers, but once she figures it out, she has great potential to be a Young Avengers if and when Marvel decides to go in that direction. Paul Rudd is great as Scott, and Jonathan Majors is a ton of fun as Kang. If anyone was worried this would be a repeat of his performance in Loki, no need to be concerned. The Kang of Ant-Man and the Wasp is very different. However, those moments with the characters don't come together to form anything. Along with the diversity of tone and genre, Marvel has done a good job of making sure that all of the movies feel like their own wholly complete story. Ant-Man and the Wasp feels like the first chapter of something or perhaps a detailed prologue, because lot of the information dumped in this movie, no matter how they might dress it up, is stuff you already know if you're watching Disney+. This isn't a terrible film, it's not even a bad one.  It's just a mediocre one, but when you set the standard high, it's obvious when you miss it. Fifteen years into the game is not the time for Marvel to start getting lazy and letting all of these movies blend together. However, that is what's starting to happen. The distinguishing factor is getting lost in each film that can't seem to come together into a cohesive whole. Thus far, the only one that hasn't completely fallen apart is the one built like a phase one film, and there's a reason for that. The shows are doing a better job of keeping that diversity of tone and genre, but the plates are wobbling, and when it comes tumbling down? It's unclear who will be standing."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," Filmmaker Peyton Reed badly wants to make a “Star Wars” film. We know this because he’s already spent a lot of time directing Lucasfilm’s “Star Wars” spin-off series “The Mandalorian,” and because his new ‘Ant-Man & The Wasp’ film, ‘Quantumania,’ is essentially a big-budget “Star Wars” movie. That’s great for Reed because that’s clearly where his ambition and aspirations lie, but it’s bad for Marvel, Ant-Man, and the “Ant-Man” franchise because the strengths of that series— its humor, its modesty, its small-scale humanity—is largely lost in a big space epic which eschews its foundations for something bigger, but alienating and not very entertaining either. At its core, the” Ant-Man & The Wasp” franchise fundamentally has always been about family— Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) trying to be a good father to his daughter and earn trust and redemption for his past transgressions as a thief. And it’s been a generational story about a family of superheroes, the legacy of Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), and whether Scott Lang could live up to that heritage. There’s even been the idea of found family units around Scott— the trio of Luis, Tip, and Kurt, for example— or his extended family, his ex-wife Maggie and her husband Jim Paxton, but all of this stuff, that’s been the essential element of ‘Ant-Man,’ is discarded in favor of upsizing the franchise into something supposedly bigger and better, which ends up just feeling generic and dull. ‘Quantumania’ does flirt, initially, with its themes of family, this time trying to get into family dysfunction and secrets. The all-grown-up Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) is a passionate advocate for human rights and just causes but keeps getting arrested for various protests. And it turns out she’s been arrested more than Scott knows because family members like Hank have been clandestinely bailing her out. Secrets and how they can become toxic to a family, in general, are the film’s basic theme at first. Hank and Cassie have been bonding by secretly creating some kind of Quantum Realm G.P.S. doo-dad, a gadget that resembles a two-way radio of some kind that helps them map out this miniature universe. But Janet van Dyne freaks out when she discovers what they’ve been making—which foreshadows all the secrets she’s been keeping about her 30 years exiled in the Quantum Realm. Conveniently and predictably, the thingamajig short-circuits just as the whole family is having a major come-to-Jesus shouting match brawl over the irresponsibility of creating such a dangerous and unpredictable contraption that’s tied to the erratic and hazardous Quantum Realm. Soon, the whole family is sucked into the Quantum Realm—luckily, Scott, Cassie, and Hope (Evangeline Lilly) all have their suits, yes, Hank made one for Cassie, too— and becomes separated in this vast and unknowable micro-verse. From there, this is where Reed’s “Star Wars” movie begins, but because it’s Ant-Man and supposed to be wacky and amusing, it’s “Star Wars” by way of “Pee Wee’s Playhouse” with all kinds of weird and absurd CGI creatures in a world that is generally wall-to-wall VFX and Volume-LED screen generated (and it looks dark, muddy and visually bland). This is also where ‘Quantumania’ ceases to be interesting, frankly, favoring big, empty, silly-string-like CGI creatures and Quantum Realm ephemera over character, story, heart, and soul. Not that ‘Ant-Man’ films were particularly deep, meaningful, or soulful, but they innately understand what they are, how they differ from the rest of Marvel, and how that makes the franchise unique and often relatively heartfelt on top of funny and enjoyable. The strengths of the first two ‘Ant-Man’ films are the subversion of epic-scale superhero films, grounding them in something human and relatable. Reed and Co. understood the assignment, the parameter, and even the limitations that they instead looked at as opportunities to carve out their own niche and voice. Seemingly against all their previous instincts, ‘Quantumania’ grows to a super-sized scale but loses all the color and personality of the series. From there, ‘Quantumania’ is just a collection of mostly forgettable scenes that take them from point A to point B, to the inevitable point C, where everyone is back safe and sound at home again. Even Bill Murray, who shows up for a second (for an inexplicably brief and pointless amount of time), can’t even register a blip of interest or amusement. Thankfully, the Marvel character of M.O.D.O.K. does provide a lot of laughs, but other than that, it’s a startlingly solemn, unamusing, and miserable movie that disregards how enjoyable ‘Ant-Man’ movies were supposed to be—seemingly the consequence of making a big, serious, epic movie where capital “I” important things are supposed to happen is that everyone and everything tends to lose their sense of humor. Which is ironic given how insignificant ‘Quantumania’ is. It purports to be this huge movie that will have larger-than-life ramifications for the MCU, but other than introducing Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors)—the events of the movie don’t even unleash the character on the Marvel universe— given how the movie ends (nothing happens, nothing of consequence really matters), ‘Quantumania’ is one of Marvel’s most inconsequential movies in some time. It’s tempting to say Jonathan Majors steals the show—since he’s so popular at the moment, he can seemingly do no wrong in the eyes of anyone—but the Napoloen-like character and his performance are really joyless and humorless. Majors makes the classic mistake of mistaking grave seriousness for gravitas and lacks the charm of Thanos or Loki. His performance is highfalutin Shakespearean bad guy arrogance, drunk on his own self-regard, worldview, and clarity of purpose, but it’s all puffed up and stiff (even Thanos was scarier, had more personality, and more convincing, to be honest). It should be said Majors’ more effervescent He Who Remains version of Kang in Disney+ “Loki” was much more interesting for all of these reasons this one doesn’t work. Marvel loves its “Rick And Morty” writers, and ‘Quantumania’ fits into that tone a little bit too. But maybe they need a break. Penned by “Ricky and Morty” writer Jeff Loveness, this one is definitely insubstantial and lacking (and it’s worrisome that this is the same guy writing “Avengers: Kang Dynasty”)."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," The Pitch: Did you hear Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) saved the world? Because he kinda did, as chronicled in the sacred text known as Avengers: Endgame, and life post-Blip is going well for Scott as a result. The people of San Francisco love him, his girlfriend Hope (Evangeline Lilly) is thriving, and he’s getting to reconnect with his now-teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton). He doesn’t have a lot else going on at the moment… but lest you think this is starting to sound like a pretty boring movie, the Quantum Realm is here to change that. See, Cassie, with some assistance from Hope and original Ant-Man Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), has been playing with ways to explore the sub-atomic realm where Hope’s long-missing mother Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) was trapped for decades. Unfortunately, before Janet can say “no, don’t mess around with the Quantum Realm, that’s a really terrible idea,” they all get sucked down into that surreal universe, which turns out to be much more populated than previously known. It’s there that the whole family meets Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), the all-powerful multidimensional being loyal MCU viewers have already met once before. Kang’s been trapped down in the Quantum Realm for years, but made the best of it by doing his best to, well, conquer it with his advanced technology. Now, he sees his chance to escape and conquer the rest of the multiverse. If only there were some heroes around to stop him… (Spoiler alert: There are!) We Have a MODOK: When considered as a trilogy, the Ant-Man movies are pretty unique within the MCU — all three were directed by Peyton Reed (since this is sadly not the alternate universe where Edgar Wright did get to make his version), and all three are remarkably consistent in tone and approach. Which is to say, unlike more serious or grounded mini-franchises within the mega-franchise (such as the Black Panther films or Captain America-related adventures), these movies know that they are about a guy who gets real tiny and flies around on ants, and thus they don’t waste a lot of energy on overt gravitas. Quantumania might be key to kicking off the big arcs to come in the MCU Phase 5, but it doesn’t forget to have a good time. In comparison to past installments, the film is a bit lacking when it comes to creative applications of Hank Pym’s signature shrinking/embiggening technology (Ant-Man and the Wasp has it beat on that score). Instead, it channels all of its imagination into establishing the Quantum Realm as a place beyond imagination, populated by stunning and/or bizarre creatures and creations; comparisons to Star Wars are well-earned in the film’s matter-of-fact approach to the denziens of this strange sub-atomic world. To be clear, the messiest aspect of the film is the world of the Quantum Realm itself, as director Peyton Reed and writer Jeff Loveness don’t establish a great sense of internal logic or rules — there’s an entire civilization living in the space between particles? Sure, okay. (For a film that explores similar ground but in a much tighter and clearer way, you might check out Strange World on Disney+.)"
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," With the third movie in its shrinking superhero series, Marvel Studios tries its best to turn what has thus far been its silliest franchise into a proper MCU blockbuster, complete with high stakes, intense drama, and important lore tied to the overarching Multiverse Saga. To Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’s credit, it manages to supersize this adventure while still maintaining the awkward, deadpan humor that makes Paul Rudd’s portrayal of Scott Lang so endearing. Yet in its haste to do so much, some of Quantumania’s characters, ideas, and plotlines feel underdeveloped – and that’s not the first time that’s been said about a recent MCU movie. The saving grace is Jonathan Majors’ show-stopping performance as the chilling new villain Kang, but not even he can conquer the MCU’s tendency to get in its own way.  No time is wasted in establishing the drama between the various members of the Pym/Lang family unit, which is good because there’s not much of it before they’re whisked off to the wondrous-yet-dangerous Quantum Realm and must sort it all out while in the midst of an action-packed adventure. Scott’s relationship with his well-meaning delinquent daughter Cassie is the emotional crux, and while her reason for being mad at dear old dad may not feel warranted at first, Rudd and Kathryn Newton work well together to peel back the layers of abandonment and disappointment until they arrive at Quantumania’s most heartfelt moments. That the film sticks the emotional landing is one of its greatest strengths. Unfortunately, Michael Douglass’ Hank Pym doesn’t have much to do this time around, and there’s even less for Evangaline Lilly’s Hope – which feels strange for a character who’s mentioned in the title. The most delightful surprise comes from the substantial role given to Michelle Pfeiffer’s Janet van Dyne, who finally deals with the trauma of what happened to her during those 30 years in the Quantum Realm with a reserved and powerful performance. After her far-too-short appearance in the last outing, it’s most welcome for Janet to take a leading role this time around. Delivering a very different kind of powerful performance, yet one no less incredible, is Majors’ Kang. We already met a variant of this infamous Marvel Comics villain in the Loki Disney+ show, but whereas He Who Remains was flamboyant and wild-eyed, Kang is steely and sinister. Majors absolutely nails the multifaceted nature of Kang, a man who feels burdened with his domain over time yet has the fiery will to use it to achieve unthinkable ends. So much effort is put into establishing just how powerful and dangerous Kang is that it makes the irony all the more delicious when he has to face off against the goofball who talks to ants. To say that the power levels between Ant-Man and Kang are mismatched is a severe understatement. In the comics, Kang is an Avengers-level threat on par with Thanos – the kind where even a full team of Avengers would be lucky to come out victorious in a head-to-head brawl. So it’s a credit to writer Jeff Loveness and director Peyton Reed that they find ways for Ant-Man to actually stand a chance, and those ideas make for some creative action scenes. That said, punches are often pulled when it comes to setting up the stakes of those battles, which makes the dangers it builds up ultimately feel toothless. Nearly the entire story takes place in the Quantum Realm, a bizarre place where beings have broccoli for heads and they use flying mitochondria for transportation. While there’s plenty of never-before-seen sci-fi stuff to enjoy, there is seemingly no rhyme or reason behind any of it, so it all feels like computer-generated window dressing that has no bearing on events taking place. Contrast that with Disney’s recent animated film, Strange World, which also featured a family getting lost in an uncanny sci-fi landscape – but there was an explanation that tied all of the weirdness together. Similarly, we meet a band of characters in the Quantum Realm, but much like their home they don’t add much to Quantumania beyond a few jokes and a way to move the plot forward. No one embodies this issue more than Bill Murray’s character, whose one scene feels entirely inconsequential.  The same issue of underdevelopment can be felt in the theme of fighting oppression. Cassie is driven by the desire to stand up to those in power, and Kang just happens to be a power-mad dictator for everyone to resist, but Quantumania doesn’t stop to explore any of those ideas. Another recent Disney offering, the Star Wars series Andor, showed in intimate detail how rebellion can break out from under the evils of fascism, yet Quantumania is content without closer examination. It’s frustratingly surface-level in that regard. We also have to talk about MODOK. The fan-favorite murderous giant floating head has finally found his way into the live-action MCU, and while his oversized, stretched-out face never quite looks right and his body looks like a Decepticon design rejected for making people feel too uncomfortable, the character actually works. I never could have predicted that MODOK, of all “people,” would have one of the most effective character arcs, but here we are.  Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has just enough entertaining moments and a heartfelt family story, plus knockout performances in Michelle Pfeiffer’s Janet van Dyne and Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror, to make up for its more underdeveloped aspects. The exploration of its central themes, new characters, and the Quantum Realm itself only goes skin deep, leaving it feeling high on spectacle but low on substance. Even so, Quantumania works as a culmination of the Ant-Man series, a way to start things in motion for Phase 5, and a promising roadmap of where the Multiverse Saga is going."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"  When it comes to the Ant-Man series of films, it’s hard to not get caught up in what the movies aren’t as much as what they are. With 2015’s Ant-Man, one could see the potential that Edgar Wright brought to the project before leaving the film, and how the final product couldn’t quite live up to the possibility of what it could've been. In 2018’s Ant-Man and the Wasp, a film that promised an exploration of the fascinating and strange Quantum Realm, we were graced with very little of the actual mysterious area. The Ant-Man movies also sparingly used the compelling technology the story is based around, often saving the big guns for climactic battles and the occasional gag. Hell, even Scott Lang’s (Paul Rudd) favorite moments as a hero rarely center on events from his own movies, as he’s more likely to talk about fighting alongside Captain America in Civil War or when he helped take down Thanos than anything that has happened in Peyton Reed’s series of films.   For a while, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania finally feels like the realization of Scott Lang’s possibilities, as the third film in this series finally embraces the weirdness, the crazy tech, and the family bonds that gave those first two films promise. Quantumania becomes one part Fantastic Voyage, one part the Knowhere segments from Guardians of the Galaxy—an interesting blend that immediately makes this stand out from Ant-Man and Wasp’s (Evangeline Lilly) previous adventures.   But Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania isn’t just the third standalone film for Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne, it’s also the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Phase Five, as well as the true introduction of Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror—a villain being set up as the next Thanos going forward. Which means that while with some focus, Quantumania could’ve finally given us the full possibility of what an Ant-Man and Wasp movie can be, instead, Reed’s third Ant-Man film has too much to set up to just be that.   In fact, we see Kang before we ever get to Scott Lang, as Quantumania starts within the Quantum Realm, as we learn that while she was stuck in this subatomic universe for thirty years, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) also had a run-in with the man we will come to know as Kang. Before Scott and Hope even have a chance to show up, Kang has already made claim to this film.   But back in the normal universe in the present day, Scott is a star, constantly noticed on the street, getting free coffee (even though the barista believes he's Spider-Man), and now, he’s a published author with his book “Look Out For The Little Guy!” Scott’s daughter Cassie (now played by Kathryn Newton)—proving that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree—was recently held in jail for helping the little guy, and has been working with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hope on a way to explore the Quantum Realm without ever having to go back in. Cassie shows off her invention to the whole family, and Janet immediately makes them turn the device off, as it sends a signal to their location. But before they can stop sending out this signal, Scott, Hope, Hank, Janet, and Cassie are all sucked into the Quantum Realm, as they meet other creatures that inhabit this world as they try to once again escape.   The Ant-Man films have never fully incorporated the insane science of the Pym particle into the films, as we’re usually only given a taste of the possibilities. Sure, we might get a fight on a Thomas the Tank Engine track, or see a Hello Kitty PEZ dispenser blown up to absurd proportions, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania goes all-in with how odd this world truly can be. The Quantum Realm is a land that deserves further exploration, as we almost immediately meet a solid group of new characters, including the telepathic Quaz (William Jackson Harper), the freedom fighter Jentorra (Katy O’Brian), and a giant vat of goo obsessed with holes, voiced by David Dastmalchian (the closest we get to any of Scott's friends coming back—sorry Michael Peña and T.I. fans). Just a few minutes in the Quantum Realm and we see this is far more interesting than anything in the previous two Ant-Man films.   Quantumania also does a good job at really honing in on the things that worked in the first two films and expanding them. For example, the tech is used throughout here in fun ways. We get smart ants, crazy ships that are apparently run by slime worms, and plenty of size-changing antics. We even get the return of Corey Stoll’s Darren Cross, who now plays M.O.D.O.K., with a giant head that never stops being unnervingly creepy. Most of the Ant-Man powers are still relegated to Scott, Hope, and now Cassie shrinking down small, punching someone, then getting big again, but at least this world finally sees the prospects this world has.   But throwing a wrench into all this—for good and for bad—is Majors as Kang the Conquerer. Majors makes for an excellent villain, who brings nuance and subtlety to his character. Especially in the flashback moments with Janet, we see Kang as a character buried by the weight of knowing everything that can and will happen in all of time and in every multiverse. He believes his actions to be good because he knows how everything will shake out, yet the timelines have been wrecked by his knowledge. Majors makes this character likable in the beginning, but also never hides the menace and terror that he can cause at any moment. As we learned from Loki, there are many Kangs in the world, and this will certainly in the future lead to plenty of opportunities for Majors to play with the broadness, the minutiae, and the layers of this/these character(s). More than anything, Quantumania is a great introduction to what Majors will be doing with this character that we'll be seeing a lot more of over the next few years, and it’s truly exciting to see what he'll do with this character going forward.   That being said, that is the primary function of Quantumania—introducing the next big bad guy for the next few phases of the MCU’s master plan. Even though this story gets started with the cool tech and family dynamics being handled in a way that is more impactful than in any previous films, the film quickly becomes the Kang show. And that’s not entirely a bad thing, since Majors is absolutely the best part of this film, but it feels like a major character's introduction glomming onto the first Scott Lang story that actually knows what it should be doing.   Which is a shame, because all the pieces are there for a solid Scott Lang/Hope van Dyne/Pym family adventure, and with these actors doing some of their best work in the MCU, but that story gets overtaken. While Scott has always been motivated by his daughter, here, Cassie and Scott's bond is at the forefront, leading to some sweet exchanges and moments that make Ant-Man feel like more of a hero than a bit of a joke. There could also be just an entire film with Douglas and Pfeiffer, who are both excellent here. By allowing Douglas to embrace the strange Pym tech, we get some hilarious moments about his love of ants, and Pfeiffer finally gets to spend some time in the spotlight in this universe, especially when we flash back to her time in the Quantum Realm. Newton is also a fine addition to this superhero family, making yet another great new character in the MCU that could easily follow in the footsteps of one of our original heroes. And Lilly, well, she still feels lost in this series, especially considering the lack of chemistry between her and Rudd. But the tools are here to make a great Ant-Man film, but the larger MCU and the set-up for the future gets in the way. Reed and the film's writer, Jeff Loveness, clearly think they can have it all, but it rarely feels like these two stories come together in an effective and powerful way.   For what it's worth, as the set-up for where this universe is going, Quantumania is largely a success, as it's hard to walk away from this and not focus primarily on what Majors is doing. But it's easy to forget that this wasn't his story, that this was supposed to be about Scott, his family, and his loved ones. There's a fascinating world to explore here, and Ant-Man finally gets close to the full realization of the potential of his character and this concept, but it all, unfortunately, gets overtaken by the Conquerer. Quantumania is a promising, but shaky start for Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's just a shame it comes at the sake of the little guy.

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," “Ant-Man” films used to be the fun heist movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, full of sci-fi strangeness and Paul Rudd's shrinking ex-con/superhero dad, and existing as needed humorous breaks from the higher-stakes “Avengers” extravaganzas. These days, nothing is safe from becoming an all-out Marvel epic, and so goes “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” (★★½ out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters now). Gone are the usual quirky personalities and breezy shenanigans (we miss you, ginormous Hello Kitty Pez dispenser!), though returning director Peyton Reed pumps in enough family bonding and signature whimsy to complement the massive world building and a new time-traveling big bad played by a terrific Jonathan Majors. Laying important groundwork for Marvel’s film future unfortunately means losing some of the franchise’s essential scrappy charm. After helping to save galactic existence (see: “Avengers: Endgame”), Scott Lang (Rudd) is feeling pretty good about himself, enjoying the celebrity life in San Francisco and doing readings from his memoir. His 18-year-old daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who shares her ex-con father’s tendency to get in trouble with the law, thinks he should be less complacent with the heroing and still be looking out for the little guy. They’ve formed a close-knit unit with Scott’s partner Hope Van Dyne, aka the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), her mom Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her dad Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), who hatched the size-changing technology behind Ant-Man's and the Wasp’s powers. Cassie has been getting a crash course in superhero science and experimenting with sending a signal to the subatomic Quantum Realm. Janet’s not too pleased, since she was stuck there for 30 years and has been keeping secrets since, and a mishap sends them all down there “Wizard of Oz” style. After being split up, Janet uses her knowledge of the place to try and find sanctuary for Hope and Hank. Meanwhile, Scott and Cassie meet an oddball group of freedom fighters and ultimately the scarred face that runs the place. Exiled to the Quantum Realm, Kang the Conqueror (Majors) coolly boasts about killing Avengers in assorted timelines but needs to use Scott’s penchant for stealing stuff to escape his current predicament. The recent MCU, especially with its movie output, hasn’t been all that welcoming for total newcomers and “Quantumania” is not the place to start your superhero quest. (In fact, let’s give out some homework: The Disney+ “Loki” series is an extremely helpful watch to understanding the Kang business.) Like “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” “Quantumania” crams a ton in so it can shape a piece of a larger story. If you’re a hardcore fan, it’s all good. But it does complicate matters for the more casual viewer (assuming those still exist). Reed’s film does wonders mapping out the spiffy landscape of the Quantum Realm with jaw-dropping beings and splendid sights, all with a “Mad Max at the ‘Star Wars’ cantina” vibe. Bill Murray drops in as the eccentric Krylar, a shady character Janet knows well, while Scott and Cassie even meet a Guardians of the Galaxy-type misfit crew, including telepath Quaz (William Jackson Harper) and warrior Jentorra (Katy O’Brian). Yet these interesting new players get limited screen time thanks to a busy narrative with endless Ant-Men, a guy with broccoli for a head and forced callbacks. Majors thankfully rights the ship every time he pops up with his deliciously disconcerting presence. Kang's deal is slightly more confusing than the last MCU big bad, a large purple alien collecting pieces of jewelry. One day, though, we'll probably be talking about the multifaceted Kang in the same breath as Heath Ledger's Joker: Majors brings an innate and understandable humanity to a king in his own mind who's all about manipulation and winning but not without weakness. While rolling out the ubiquitous kitchen-sink finale, “Quantumania” lets Scott and Kang duke it out in a rousing slugfest that’s the highlight of this dizzying adventure. Even when the ant-sized Avenger headlines a large-scale Marvel epic, it’s still the little things – like two dudes throwing hands, with no superpowers in sight – that mean a lot."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Called “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” — these nonsensical titles! — the Marvel movie does boast a terrific new villain in Kang the Conquerer, played by Jonathan Majors. He’s a time-hopping multiverse manipulator, and red-hot Majors has gravitas as he snarls about the injustices the world has done to him. Whenever he’s on-screen, we are transfixed. Nonetheless, Scott’s reveling in post-“Endgame” glory. He wrote a best-selling memoir called “Look Out for the Little Guy!” and tells anyone who’ll listen that he saved the world. Then a device created by his curious daughter Cassandra (Kathryn Newton, playing a personality rather than a person) accidentally whisks her, Scott, Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank (Michael Douglas) to the teeny tiny Quantum Realm. The humor here is especially lowbrow. To speak the Quantum Realm’s language, Scott and Co. need to glug a character’s “ooze.” That pink, gelatinous, tentacled oozer is obsessed with human anatomy and asks Scott, “How many holes do you have?” Their infantile airships look like something you’d find in a shop on Christopher Street. And Corey Stoll as doofy, Humpty Dumpty-esque M.O.D.O.K. is a decent sight-gag laugh at first, but goes nowhere. M.O.D.O.K.’s big revelation after 90 minutes is “I don’t want to be a d – – k!” None of the dumb jokes are as funny as Mel Brooks’ “ludicrous speed” or Dark Helmet from “Spaceballs.” And they’re confusing, because they’re carelessly tossed into an uber-serious plot about revolutionaries overthrowing a violent oppressor.  Some of the madness would be forgiven if any of the characters other than Kang were layered or had a single reason for us to like them. Rudd behaving like an emotionless class clown does not sustain a movie. It never has. Lilly doesn’t do much other than get a haircut, which they make a lame joke about. And with Marvel audiences having recently seen “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” in which Angela Bassett gave a performance that will likely win her an Oscar, Pfeiffer and Douglas acting like the “Out-of-Towners” in front of a green screen just doesn’t cut it.  Still, you’ve got to admire the size of Reed’s ambitions in building his detailed new universe. After two slight “Ant-Man” movies, “Quantumania” feels like a different series entirely."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Crafting a crackling third chapter in a franchise is always a difficult proposition. Even with a staggering amount of the audience’s grace afforded to them, the filmmakers behind ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA deliver a feature that never feels like more than a bridge to a larger, far more compelling idea. Director Peyton Reed’s trio of films all center on two families overcoming otherworldly obstacles. However, this iteration continually hobbles itself, churning out (and, yes, it feels very manufactured) a hackneyed, exposition-heavy story that’s a nothing-burger – a feeble, forgettable and frustrating product. When we rejoin happy-go-lucky Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), he’s reflecting on the wacky journey that’s brought him this far. He’s released a self-help book and is hyper-focused on being a good dad to daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who’s taken up her father’s predilection for getting arrested – only for good social causes. His partner Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) is a wildly successful businesswoman, having taken over her father Hank Pym’s (Michael Douglas) company after he retired to spend time with wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who’s still sorting through trauma she incurred while trapped in the Quantum Realm. It was Janet’s ‘Nam. Unbeknownst to Janet and Scott though, curious Cassie has launched a special project with Hank and Hope mapping this place that dares not be spoken about. This technological advancement will help humans see into micro-universes beyond what they can imagine. Yet what’s meant to help actually winds up hurting when their device attracts evil Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), whose mysterious (yet utterly predictable) beef with Janet is wreaking havoc in the Quantum Realm. They all get sucked in, splintered and stranded in unfamiliar territory, and must figure out a way back to each other while contending with Kang’s malevolent forces. Reed and screenwriter Jeff Loveness’ first act is filled with maddening elements, from the glib narration to the convoluted circumstances entirely generated by the withholding of pertinent facts – including valuable information that could’ve prevented the events in this film altogether. The number of times Janet says a variation of “I have to tell you something” or “There’s no time to tell you” wears on our patience. Once Janet decides in Act 2 to finally spit out her backstory, which involves Kang and a MacGuffin only she has access to, the film starts finding its rhythm. But even that fails to truly impress. For a story that wants to take us beyond the realm of our imagination, it’s a shock that it doesn’t transport us anywhere we haven’t seen before on-screen. The micro-realms reductively recall STAR WARS and STRANGE WORLD in their aesthetic designs. New characters that inhabit these places offer a modicum of interest, but don’t affect the tale told much – especially in the third act when their inclusion should complement the heroes’ journeys. Mind-reader Quaz (William Jackson Harper) and squishy blob Veb (David Dastmalchian) represent what little comedic relief is to be had. Jentorra (Katy M. O’Brian), the filmmakers’ stab at a by-the-numbers “strong female character,” is pandering and regressive thanks to poor writing (not O’Brien’s portrayal, as she delivers sincerity and strength). Lackluster visual effects also prevent us from feeling totally immersed. No matter how much they try to disguise its crutch-like use, shooting on “The Volume” in lieu of green-screen tech has an off-putting, uncanny valley look that’s difficult to ignore, adding a hollowed-out, low-stakes atmosphere. It hinders the scale and scope of the picture’s action. The trippy, LSD-like sequence where Scott encounters multitudes of himself (a subtextual commentary on the nature of identity and self) doesn’t feel nearly as oppressive and urgent as SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME’s comparable mind-melting sequence. Even the inevitable climactic battle can be reduced to a fatigued shoot-out between the blue and red teams. There are bright spots, specifically in a few of its performances. Though her character is saddled with ridiculous contrivances, Pfeiffer rises above the fray, giving a performance with pathos. She shares palpably-pitched chemistry with Majors in their flashback sequence. Majors infuses his mercurial role with a sense of high-caliber gravitas and gloss. He shifts from soft to stoic (and back again) with razor-sharp precision, making his work a standout sight to see. When the first end credit tag holds more weight, potential and thrills than the entire two hours that came before it, there’s a massive problem. Unfortunately for us, we had to sit through the multitude of other problems riddling this feature to come to this conclusion. Similar to the sequence where Scott is faced with the possibilities of himself in the Quantum Realm, these filmmakers were confronted with vast possibilities of where this story could go and what these worlds could look like. Yet when faced with a veritable buffet of choices, what’s served to us is a sloppy meal."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," CLEVELAND, Ohio -- When I was a kid my asthma medicine gave me wild dreams. They were set in this strange, psychedelic world inhabited by weird creatures doing inexplicable things. Looming over it was an equally inexplicable sense of impending and inescapable doom. When I woke up, I wasn’t sure where I was or what had just happened. The third film in the series starts off as the kind of light-hearted, small-stakes, family-centered superhero comedy you’ve come to expect from Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang/Ant-Man and Evangeline Lilly’s Hope Van Dyne/The Wasp. Both are living their best post-“Endgame” lives. He’s basking in the celebrity of a second-tier Avenger, she’s using Pym Tech to save the world. Their blended family includes Scott’s daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), now an 18-year-old social activist with a super-suit of her own which allows her to change sizes at the push of a button. Hope’s father Hank (Michael Douglas) is content tending to his army of ants and spending time with his wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), back after being stuck in the Quantum Realm for 30 years. But she is still having difficulty reacclimating herself to life on the surface. Things go awry when they’re all accidentally zapped into the subatomic world beneath our universe. The two families are separated. Scott and Cassie hook up with a group of Freedom Fighters led by the warrior Jentorra (Katy O’Brian) and telepath Quaz (William Jackson Harper). Janet leads Hope and Hank to a meeting with the pretentious Lord Krylar (Bill Murray), who can put them in touch with the one person who can send them all back home. That’s Kang (Jonathan Majors), a villain so powerful and dangerous he was exiled by a mysterious force to the Quantum Realm. He and Janet have some history and unfinished business. Leveraging Kang’s powers to get back home without unleashing an unfathomable evil onto the rest of the multiverse in the process is going to be tricky. Turns out, exhausting too. The Quantum Realm is a visually imaginative and fantastical place bursting with color, sound and movement. It’s a world unlike any other seen before on screen. But it’s too much. The subatomic world often feels like the result of a brainstorming meeting that began with the phrase, “There are no bad ideas.” So, you end up with Veb (David Dastmalchian), a cute, cuddly blob obsessed with humans and their holes; MODOK, Corey Stoll’s Darren Cross (the baddie from the first “Ant-Man” film) reimagined as a giant head; and the self-explanatory Broccoli Man. The bombastic and chaotic tone drowns out the quieter, more human moments. Director Peyton Reed and screenwriter Jeff Loveness get some mileage out of Scott and Cassie’s maturing relationship and the uneasy dynamic between Hope and Janet, but not enough to really tug at the heartstrings. The backstory of the Freedom Fighters is undercooked, wasting the talents of O’Brian and Harper. Worse, Kang’s motivations and powers are never fully explained. “Loki” viewers will recognize the character as a variant of He Who Remains from that show’s season finale, and up-to-date fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe know he’ll serve as the Thanos of the next “Avengers” outing. But none of that really helps this movie. What’s left is a plot that isn’t much more than a series of chases and battles. This, thank goodness, is where the movie is most successful. The proclivity of Ant-Man, the Wasp and Cassie to switch between small, medium and large at a moment’s notice give the action sequences a frenetic and unpredictable beauty, even if you have trouble figuring out what exactly is happening at times. The film is saved by its performances, too. Rudd and Lilly are their reliable selves as the quippy dad Scott Lang and the strong-willed Hope Van Dyne, though their romantic coupling feels forced. Still, the two leads prove they’re capable of carrying a film with higher stakes than we’ve seen before. Newton’s Cassie should fit nicely alongside the next generation of superheroes Marvel is assembling. And Douglas and Pfeiffer add some much-needed gravitas to the proceedings. But it’s Majors who steals the show by displaying the screen presence, charisma and complexity worthy of building the next phase of a multi-billion dollar franchise around. Murray’s brief appearance is the anomaly, a scenery-chewing cash grab that would make Marlon Brando blush. So, yeah, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is a lot, a sensory overload of a movie that has its charms but ultimately leaves you feeling numb and empty inside. And good luck making sense of it. But 31 movies into the MCU, the risk of FOMO is real. So, if you’re on the fence about it, I’ll respond with the same three words my now-wife told me when I asked her to move in with me three months after we met.

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Quantumania works best when it&#8217;s focused on being a silly self-contained sci-fi movie and not the laying the foundation for the next couple of years of movies and Disney&#43; shows&#46;

"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," It’s interesting to recall when George Lucas began going completely digital, with behind-the-scenes images of large, empty, green rooms serving as some of the filming stages for the Star Wars prequels. Robert Rodriguez was on a similar path early on with Sin City. Mocked by some at the time, at the very least, the worlds created in the prequels have stood the test of time when referencing Coruscant or Mustafar. Nowadays, so many of these huge films rely on completely digital worlds. I wonder how well people will remember the cities in the Quantum Realm years from now. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is aggressively fine as a whole, trading in something closer to reality for a vast digital space, but as a start to Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, one wonders if Scott Lang was the right man to call in for the job. Paul Rudd returns as Lang, the one-time petty criminal who is now credited as one of the Avengers who helped save the world from Thanos. He’s taking this badge of honor well as he struts through the streets of San Francisco with an extra pep in his step (and a memoir he’s happy to promote). Things are going well all around, it would seem. Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) is using her father’s technology for humanitarian efforts. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet van Dyne (Michaelle Pfeiffer) are back together again following Janet’s rescue from the Quantum Realm. We don’t get to see the ex-con-turned-security crew played by Michael Peña, T.I., and David Dastmalchian this time around, but let’s assume they’re doing great as well. Part of the appeal of the Ant-Man films has been how low-stakes they are compared to the rest of what’s happening in a world full of superheroes. Director Peyton Reed returns here, and while the early minutes bring the familiar feel of a loose adventure-comedy set in the Bay Area once again, that’s not where things will stay. As it turns out, Scott’s daughter Cassie (now played by Kathryn Newton) has been conducting some Quantum-related experiments. Sending a signal into the mysterious world, however, turns out to be a bad idea. Faster than you can say, “Honey, I shrunk the Pyms,” Scott and his makeshift family have found themselves stranded inside the Quantum Realm, and there’s a lot more to this world than everyone but Janet has realized. On the one hand, the past two Ant-Man films have set up and expanded on the potential to be had regarding this minuscule dimension. However, on the other hand, the audience must now contend with losing the somewhat grounded, somewhat relatable capers delivered in the previous films in favor of a fantastic voyage at subatomic levels as the plan going forward for Quantumania. Making that work for the better means offering a location full of memorable imagery and intriguing ideas, and that’s what I wish this film could have settled on more. Make no mistake, Quantumania is never lacking in visual spectacle, as Rudd, Lilly, Newton, Douglas, and Pfeiffer are practically starring in an animated feature. With that in mind, I wish Reed and writer Jeff Loveness allowed these characters to dive even deeper into all the weird stuff being presented. Early on, during our time in the Quantum realm, we’re introduced to a creature obsessed with the number of holes in humans, a telepath played by William Jackson Harper, sentient buildings with rocket arms, and whatever Bill Murray is supposed to be. That’s all well and good, but it never goes much further, even if the CG is mostly up to par for this franchise. Much of this portion of the Quantum Realm exists in its current form because of Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror, a villain whom we will be contending with in one form or another for a while (the next Avengers film is sub-titled “The Kang Dynasty”). Learning about Kang means dealing with a lot of dialogue surrounding his backstory, which is both clunky and weirdly vague, given how much of the movie he’s in. Much of that has to do with Pfeiffer’s Janet playing coy about how much she knows based on her past experiences, but that only makes me wonder how much mystery was required and how much was reliant on convenient plot devices to prolong these explanations. Regardless, as good as Majors is in the role (and let’s be clear, he’s a terrific actor going just above neutral to match what’s needed in this script), the Kang stuff is far less interesting than seeing a creature with a laser gun for a face. Perhaps the biggest concern comes down to how much shrinking and growing is happening here, in addition to the comedic beats that come at a far higher frequency in the Ant-Man films than most of the other MCU features. The good news is that Quantumania continues to deliver fun ideas for how Scott, Hope, and others can play around with their size alterations. Those Pym Particles sure do come in handy, and what the effort going into that superpower may lack in stakes (the suits are never even close to malfunctioning this time around), the film gains in once again delving into trippy visuals akin to what’s been seen on the cosmic side of the MCU. As far as the comedy goes, well, this is more of a serious affair by comparison. Without the ex-cons or the Elmore Leonard-adjacent plotting that made Ant-Man and the Wasp a relief following the dusting that concluded Avengers: Infinity War, this third entry is more typical MCU stuff. There’s plenty of humor to go around as far as delivering a four-quadrant blockbuster, but nothing that’s rising to any real subversive level or clever in a way that stands out (but several one-liners did hit great). Rudd is still certainly down to clown, and that’s preferred to seeing him attempt to fight Kang (being played by Majors in Creed III shape underneath all that armor). Still, even with one notable inclusion involving everyone’s favorite Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing, it’s a tamer effort as far as all the laughs are concerned. However, audiences looking for a good time are still going to get it. This is the 31st of these movies, so it’s not as though all involved are unaware of what works to accomplish what’s needed. Perhaps the film could have made up for some issues were it not stuck with having to provide some setup for several movies to come. With that said, this is not exactly the most complicated plot to work out. Quantumania stands on its own well enough, delivers the goods as far as spectacle and entertainment, allows a number of good actors to work as well as needed (Douglas still seems to be having fun with all this nonsense), and comes in at merely two hours (which is strangely a relief these days). The story is pretty familiar, but at this point, was Ant-Man really the character you needed to satisfy your complex narrative needs? If so, well, as Ant-Man would point out, there’s always room to grow."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," In the decade since its inception, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has delivered a number of recurring elements throughout its films. One of those elements? The third film in a hero’s trilogy will usually put them through the wringer. Spider-Man, Thor, Iron Man…everyone gets a turn. And now with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, it’s Ant-Man’s time to run the gauntlet. Quantumania picks up in the wake of Avengers: Endgame, as Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has become a worldwide celebrity. But he feels estranged from his now-teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton). That’s the least of Scott’s worries. When one of Cassie’s experiments goes haywire, it pulls him – alongside Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfieffer) – into the Quantum Realm. And soon, Scott runs afoul of Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), a time-traveling warlord who has spent centuries trapped in the Realm. As Kang attempts to utilize Scott’s help in escaping from subatomic purgatory, Janet starts to reveal more about her own time trapped there and how Kang could threaten all of reality. The Ant-Man films have always been an outlier within the wider MCU. They’ve often been referred to as “palette cleansers” – a break in-between the bigger event films and more popular heroes. Director Peyton Reed and writer Jeff Loveness aim to change that, as Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania features the sort of scale that you’d expect in an Avengers or Star Wars movie. The sequence where Scott and his friends fall through the Quantum Realm is extremely trippy, with a kaleidoscope of colors and prisms flying at the viewer as things get smaller. Another sequence has Ant-Man multiplying endlessly – and when one of these duplicates attempts to grow to giant size, he literally falls apart, peeling into ribbons. And Kang’s citadel feels like it was ripped right out of a classic sci-fi novel: massive floating rings surround the tower, and fleets of sleek silver ships take to the sky. Those visuals extend to the denizens of the Quantum Realm, including living buildings that can fly and shoot lasers along with giant killer amoebas and men with broccoli for heads! But as always, it’s the heroes that drive the story and the main thrust of the story is the relationship between Scott and Cassie. Scott was trapped in the Quantum Realm for five years prior to Endgame – that’s five years of his daughter’s life he’s missed. It gives Rudd a new angle to play with, as he gives Scott an underlying sadness in his talks with Cassie. One moment has him repeatedly saying that everything is OK – despite the fact that they’re trapped in another universe with no way out. And you can clearly hear the panic in Rudd’s voice. Newton matches him scene for scene, playing Cassie as a teenager who wants to change the world but gets in over her head. The father/daughter relationship between Scott and Cassie has been the major throughline of the Ant-Man films, so it only makes sense that Quantumania would put it at center stage. The standout of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is Majors, who continues to smash every role he’s in. And he lends Kang a quiet, yet chilling menace that instantly cements him as a top-tier MCU villain. Nowhere is this made more clear than in his first scene with Rudd; when Scott brags that he’s an Avenger, Kang simply replies “Have I killed you before?” He then threatens to kill Cassie and make Scott relive it for all eternity, his voice never raising an octave. And Majors makes for an impressive physical presence, as he towers over nearly everyone and delivers one of the film’s most brutal fight scenes. If there’s one issue with the film, it’s that the Pym/Van Dyne storyline doesn’t quite gel with the Scott/Cassie one. Don’t get me wrong, Douglas and Pfieffer are excellent – especially Pfieffer. Viewers will finally get to see what happened to her all those years ago, and she nails the demeanor of someone who’s been suffering through trauma. She feels distant and closed off, and freaks out whenever Kang is brought up. But the editing of these two storylines feels super choppy, particularly in the first act. And Lilly feels extremely outclassed, especially when sharing a scene with Bill Murray. Compared to Rudd and Newton’s interactions with the other Quantum Realm inhabitants – including William Jackson Harper as a surly telepath – it’s lacking. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania brings the pint-sized hero’s trilogy to a close, supersizing the action without skimping on the emotion. I definitely recommend checking it out, especially in IMAX as the visuals feel like a perfect fit for that format. It’s like the saying goes: the third time’s the charm.

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," An evil ruler with a legion of faceless soldiers at their disposal. A band of heroes, traveling across vast new worlds filled with evocative and wild creatures. Transports that look like giant stingrays. Enormous battles across towering technological wonders. A cantina. Yup, that all sounds like Star Wars, but it’s actually Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, a massive sci-fi adventure that takes both Ant-Man, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, to brand new places, with both good and bad results. Look. It’s been 15 years at this point. If you love the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you’ll probably like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania more than you don’t. It’s an entertaining, epic exercise in world-building with huge set pieces and surprises a-plenty. The MCU sprinkled with Star Wars, Dune, and Heavy Metal Magazine. Conversely, if you don’t get goosebumps every time the “Marvel Studios” logo hits the screen, chances are it’s not going to work as well for you. It’s uneven in terms of pacing and character while relying heavily on the audience having a pre-existing connection with this franchise. Once again directed by Peyton Reed, this time from a script by Jeff Loveness, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania starts similarly to the other Ant-Man movies. Since saving the galaxy in Avengers: Endgame, Scott Lang is enjoying a relatively chill life. Things are going well with, and for, his girlfriend Hope, and her parents Hank and Janet  (Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer) are getting along well with Scott’s now 18-year-old daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). In fact, Cassie has been working with Hank to study the Quantum Realm, the infinite micro universe Janet was trapped in for decades, and Scott time travels through to defeat Thanos. Once that’s revealed, the familiar pace and humor of the previous Ant-Man films quickly pivot as all the characters are sucked into the Quantum Realm. The speed with which Quantumania gets started is commendable. It makes things very clear this story is going to be set in, and be about, the Quantum Realm. Plus, the Quantum Realm is a stunning place—a nearly indescribable combination of sci-fi landscapes, trippy art, and visuals inspired by actual microscopic biology. Throughout the film, Reed gives us the occasional moment to merely bask in this beautiful world and it’s a sight to be seen. You could argue the Quantum Realm itself is the main character of the film which, again, has positives and negatives. Once down there, the basic spine of the movie is about Hank, Janet, and Hope being separated from, and trying to find, Scott and Cassie, while Kang looks for all of them. That sounds straightforward but, because the film is in this grand new world, it comes with a lot of exposition. And we do mean a lot. Not only does the film have to explain (or at least question) the very nature of each aspect world, all manner of new creatures and characters are introduced and explained along the way. It’s fascinating stuff, much of which you kind of wish you could pause and talk about in real-time, but it’s also a little overwhelming. Characters like Lord Krylar (Bill Murray) as well as a group of Freedom Fighters including Jentorra (Katy M. O’Brian), Quaz (William Jackson Harper), and Veb (David Dastmalchian), pave the way for several of the film’s action sequences but more often than not slow down the film’s momentum because each character and faction needs to be given context. As a result, large sections of the film feel a little bloated as they’re more concerned with explaining this world and less concerned with the original characters. Characters who, for long stretches, feel like pawns being moved across a chess board. That too sort of becomes a Rorschach test for the film. Do you enjoy seeing wild creatures and landscapes even if they don’t ultimately add much? Is that enough to keep you satisfied as a filmgoer? While those issues muddle the middle of the film, eventually, we learn more about Janet and Kang, everyone meets everyone, and things kick into gear. The third act then features a two-pronged climax (separated by another seismic exposition dump, of course) that’s presented almost like an appetizer and a main course. Both are hugely enjoyable, filled with big, cool payoffs, and provide just enough of Marvel magic to cover up some of the film’s bigger issues.  That satisfaction also comes from the fact that while the movie might be called Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, it more accurately could have been called “The Janet and Kang Show.” Big sections of the movie are led by Pfeiffer’s Janet and she plays the heroic lead with ease and confidence. Some of those scenes are then opposite Majors’ Kang, who delivers a dynamic, powerful, almost hypnotic performance. It’s not exactly clear what Kang’s powers are at various times, which can be frustrating, but his motivations are clear and anytime Majors is on screen, everything instantly gets better. That, of course, goes for Pfeiffer too, and when it’s both of them it’s just *chef’s kiss* wonderful. On the flip side, with so much focus on Kang and Janet, Hank and Hope have significantly dialed-back roles. That makes sense for Hank as he’s always been a supporting character, but Hope’s character is in the title of the movie. So it’s a little odd that, for most of the film, she basically waits until Scott needs her, saves him, and then disappears off-screen again for a few minutes. And while that’s disappointing, the Scott and Cassie relationship does its best to balance it. Most of the film’s emotional core derives from Scott’s love for his daughter who he missed so many years with due to the Blip. Now, she’s grown up, has a mind of her own, and his attempts to relate to her while also being proud of the woman she’s become is a constant struggle. That relationship isn’t always at the forefront, but in the crucial scenes where it is, Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania achieves the heights it almost certainly set out to do throughout. I’d also be remiss if I didn’t mention M.O.D.O.K. This fan-favorite Marvel character makes his MCU debut in the film and while getting into any specifics would give away some of the film’s biggest spoilers, the way the character is visualized and handled is another major highlight of the movie. Everything about the character achieves a very specific, weird, yet wonderful tonal balance that the rest of the movie only touches upon. In the end, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has enough wild sci-fi adventure, family-driven emotion, and humor throughout to make it an enjoyable entry into the MCU. The introduction of the formidable, magnetic Kang is another bonus and the always excellent cast - highlighted by Pfeiffer - keeps things afloat. The problem is for a movie set in a neverending microscopic world, sometimes it gets buried under its possibilities. The visuals outshine the story. The story gets pushed aside to set up this new Marvel world. And this new Marvel world becomes the focal point while the main characters fade into the background. And so, Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumnaia doesn’t reach the heights of its previous two films in terms of overall cohesion, but what it lacks there, it more than makes up with in raw ambition.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Peyton Reed’s Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is being released as a keystone piece for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Launching what has been referred to as Phase 5 of the canon, the movie has an important big picture role to play thanks to the much-hyped arrival of Jonathan Majors’ Kang The Conqueror – the villain set up to be the MCU’s new overarching central antagonist following the blockbuster defeat of Thanos (Josh Brolin) in Joe and Anthony Russo’s Avengers: Endgame. The film is set up with the intention of giving fans an important preview of what’s to come from the next few years in the superhero-centric world… but with any luck, that’s not a promise on which Marvel will deliver. This is because audiences have come to expect a lot from the popular comic book movie franchise, and while Kang does stand out as an interesting character, the third Ant-Man And The Wasp feature is among the most disappointing that Marvel Studios has produced. The movie marks another crack at world building for the MCU, this time exploring the microscopic universe known as the Quantum Realm, but it’s an effort that is fumbled in almost every way. A tepid, boring narrative, weak character development and utilization, and mucky and endless green screen scenery are just some of the film’s significant weak spots, and it all amounts to a blockbuster that’s never compelling for more than five minutes at a time and has nothing original or special to contribute to the superhero genre. Scripted by Jeff Loveless, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania catches up with Avenger Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) at his cheeriest. He has written and published a new book about his adventures as one of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, and he is part of a tight family unit with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), and his now-adult daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). There are secrets being held from him, however: Janet is consistently hesitant to reveal anything about the decades that she spent in the Quantum Realm prior to her rescue in Ant-Man And The Wasp, and Cassie has been quietly doing research with Hope and Hank to learn more about the mysterious and dangerous world. This all comes to a head when a device Cassie has invented malfunctions, and all five of them get shrunk down and sent to the strange alternate dimension. Separated into two groups – Scott paired with Cassie, and Hope with Hank and Janet – they explore the Quantum Realm and try to find each other, all the while discovering what Janet has been hiding from them. It turns out that there is an entire civilization that exists in the bizarre pocket universe, and ruling over it is Kang The Conqueror, a being exiled from the multiverse who has risen to power thanks to his possession of advanced technology from the distant future. The introduction of Kang is easily the best thing that Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania has going for it. Jonathan Majors once again proves that his charisma and magnetism is boundless, and flashback sequences that inform the audience about the character’s history with Janet van Dyne prove to be the most enthralling bits that the film has to offer. As much excitement as that provides, though, everything else is almost entirely hollow. The blockbuster has a terrible “telling, not showing” problem that both handicaps the storytelling and undermines the antagonist’s impact. It’s explained by both Janet and residents of the Quantum Realm that Kang is a terrible despot who rules as an oppressive and terrifying tyrant, but that’s never illustrated in any significant way (he just seems to occupy his own little corner of the Quantum Realm, which he has outfitted with a bunch of empty, shiny buildings patrolled by faceless robots). And while it’s said that he has dangerous powers, we don’t actually see anything more than some flying, minimal telekinesis, and the ability to shoot beams out of his hands. With the way things unfold, you definitely don’t get to grasp why this villain is expected to be a serious threat that will eventually require the attention of the Avengers. And while Kang’s role is undercooked in the film, he’s hardly alone. None of the characters have arcs to speak of, unless you count Scott Lang making a bit more of an effort to be a better father (which isn’t really much of an arc). Despite her being a titular character, Hope van Dyne barely has a role in Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, as her presence in the story is almost entirely defined by her being frustrated that her mother hasn’t been more open with her. Janet at least gets to be a part of the aforementioned Kang flashbacks; Hank and Cassie are just kind of… there. It’s also hard not to feel bad for MCU newcomers Katy O’Brian and William Jackson Harper, who respectively play Quantum Realm inhabitants Jentorra and Quaz. It’s not altogether surprising that a movie that doesn’t know what to do with its leads doesn’t know what to do with its supporting cast, but he actors’ talents are nonetheless wasted on bit parts that carry zero weight. They provide exposition and take part in battle sequences, and that’s it. Additionally, it would be unwise to start having expectations for the role played by Bill Murray in the film, as he is part of a 15-minute segment in the first half of the second act that could be excised from the blockbuster and the only impact would be improving the narrative’s pacing. Given that the Ant-Man movies have been teasing the full breadth of the Quantum Realm for the better part of a decade now, you’d also think that the visuals would be spectacular and eye-popping in Quantumania, but it’s just another arena of disappointment. There is some decent character design executed, but environments look ugly and unreal, and there is a total lack of dynamic set pieces. Heroes growing and shrinking lacks novelty eight years after the release of the first Ant-Man, and while the film does try and get a bit creative at one point by having Scott Lang get trapped in what’s referred to as a “probability storm,” it turns out to be an idea with zero internal logic, and that seriously detracts from the fun. In the past few years, Marvel Studio’s overall output hasn’t been as strong as what was accomplished between 2008 and 2019, but that’s been somewhat excusable. A high bar was set by the overall quality of the Infinity Saga, release and production plans were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the firing/re-hiring of James Gunn for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 forced some surprise shuffles behind-the-scenes, and the canon has been diversifying with the development of original programming for Disney+ to pair with the big screen blockbusters. Arriving in the aftermath of all that, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania was supposed to be the film that put the franchise back on solid ground and set up an exciting future – but that’s not what has been made here. Instead, it’s a film that mightily struggles in pretty much every important area, and it raises some serious concerns about what’s on the way from the MCU in the months and years to come.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," When it comes to their Marvel properties, there’s this slightly morbid insistence by Disney to tie every teeny tiny detail of previous movies, television shows, and character arcs together in obsessive fashion. It’s becoming such an uncontrollable urge by the studio to engage in this behavior that the cause-and-effect is resulting in disasters like “Eternals,” “Thor: Love and Thunder,” and now, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Trying too hard to force a non-story into the already lame Ant-Man mythology, the film reunites superhero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as Ant-Man and the Wasp. The pair find themselves thrust into the dangerous Quantum Realm along with Hope’s parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), along with Scott’s teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). As they explore the unusual terrain and alien society filled with strange creatures, Janet reveals that she didn’t quite tell the group everything about the three decades she spent trapped in the realm. Facing new dangers from supervillan Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors), the family must unite to stop a worldwide disaster. Very little about this project feels like a satisfying superhero movie and instead, it’s more like an assemblage of other (and far better) science fiction films. If not for the titanic budget and big-name stars, it could almost be mistaken for a Redbox “mockbuster” of “Star Wars,” “Mad Max,” “Avatar,” and “Godzilla” combined. The film takes place extensively in the Quantum Realm, which provides an unsightly setting of muted, dark brown, washed-out visuals. It’s an ugly place, so who why would audiences want to spend time there? The Realm is a melting pot of exotic creatures and peculiar inhabitants that appear to have waltzed right out of the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine. They’re cool to look at I guess, but was the point to make the film more appealing to children, or was it Disney’s way of appeasing the animators by letting them have some fun? The first third of the film seems like it’s Janet’s show, as she keeps bringing up the fact that she has all these secrets that she won’t spill to Hope and Hank (even though they’re all stuck in the Realm together). There’s no compelling mystery nor reveal. Screenwriter Jeff Loveness is grasping at straws to craft a somewhat cohesive story while also struggling to make it fit into the MCU mythology. At some point, I wish someone would just make a damn standalone Marvel superhero movie and quit worrying about who and what goes where and how. The story is frequently erratic. There’s plenty of energetic CGI action, but there also some moments that play like a touching family drama, some that create an anti-climatic post-apocalyptic narrative, and lots of failed attempts at comic relief. The film also has recurring (and awkward) socially conscious messaging that doesn’t entirely feel out of place, but it is aggressive (there’s even a direct mention of socialism by one of the characters, which will really aggravate already-angry conservatives).  The screenplay is peppered with dreadful one-liners like “it’s never too late to stop being a dick!” and “ants don’t give up!” I really, really wish I was joking about this. The remainder of the movie features a lot of talk about time, the desire to get home, and — Marvel fans, you know what’s coming — the multiverse! It’s that one little word that means endless movies, endless stories, and endless money. It’s also the easy way to guarantee that all of these films in the canon always have a cop-out to lazily excuse away any inconsistencies (not that many of us could keep up or remember anyway). Another major problem with the film is that it can only chug along on Rudd’s likeability (and the cast’s talent) for so long. It’s barely tolerable until Kang shows up, but he’s a wickedly delicious character portrayed by a terrific actor (it’s a real shame that this had to be the film for Majors’ MCU debut). In fact, the entire cast deserves better. Despite all of them turning in strong performances, they still feel mostly wasted here. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” lacks the memorable spectacle that most superhero films need in order to succeed. There’s no massively rousing, crowd-pleasing moment, and it’s one of the more unremarkable entries in the MCU. But I’m also a Marvel fan, and the movie is massively disappointing. On the other hand, I very much am interested what YOU think about the movie. I hope you’ll come back and share your thoughts once you’ve seen it.  For the past three years, there has been an overabundance of disappointment in more ways than just picking the movie industry. I’m a fan of science fiction and fantasy. Marvel films are in those categories. I like to be entertained and enjoy a movie and have even started watching movies and streaming series outside my wheelhouse. I know you’re a critic and are paid to present your personal opinion regarding what you’ve viewed. But most critics have been doing their jobs for so long becoming complacent that eventually, they become mechanically analytical in their process. Marvel has a better working recipe for making their movies and I always look forward to seeing them. DC has a few that are all right but are struggling to catch up, yet I still watch them nonetheless. Everyone, including yourself, has a right to express their opinion, paid or not, but I know even before I see Ant-Man and the Wasp Quamtumania that I’ll enjoy it based on the character’s previous movies and series and that even as a passive Marvel fan I’ll not have any expectations."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," Ant-Man has always been about the little guy. That was Scott Lang’s (Paul Rudd) charm: the underrated, underseen superhero who disarmed the audience with humor and disarmed his enemies by suddenly growing and shrinking at lightning speeds. Ant-Man’s whole conceit is a little silly to begin with (he shrinks! And he talks to ants!), and the Ant-Man movies wisely leaned into that, telling hijinks-filled one-off adventures that felt small in comparison to the larger MCU. But they were a refreshing — and often visually exciting — change of pace from the big battles and civil wars. The first Ant-Man was the offbeat coda to Marvel’s Phase Two, and Ant-Man and the Wasp was a light caper that gave us Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer in one movie. Scott Lang might have played a key part in the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, but even he seemed surprised that he was there. At their best, the Ant-Man movies were light diversions — the closest thing that Marvel could get to old-fashioned star-driven vehicles, with Rudd, Douglas, and Pfeiffer’s shared charisma doing a lot of the heavy lifting on mostly fine movies. So it’s with a strange finality that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania arrives, having the difficult job of wrapping up an already scattershot MCU and introducing the new franchise Big Bad in Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors).  Quantumania didn’t have to be boring. There are a lot of interesting conflicts simmering beneath the surface: Scott’s aimlessness after saving the world, his pain over having lost all that time with his daughter, and the fact that everyone keeps confusing him for Spider-Man. But Quantumania doesn’t have time for Ant-Man’s various crises because it has lore to build, and a whole new world to introduce. The plot picks up shortly after the events of Endgame. Scott is basking in his newly earned celebrity, happily doing book tours and photo ops, while struggling to reconnect with his daughter Cassie (recast as Kathryn Newton). Cassie has inherited the passion for justice that Scott seems to have lost, which is what gets her thrown in jail multiple times. But Cassie’s eagerness to prove herself extends beyond protecting the less fortunate, she’s also thrown herself into a quantum experiment — one that goes horribly wrong and sends the Lang and Pym families hurtling into the Quantum Realm. Turns out, the Quantum Realm isn’t the void that everyone thought it was. It’s actually a thriving alien underworld full of strange humanoid creatures, breathing buildings, and bioluminescent monsters. Scott and Cassie, separated from the others, are quickly captured by a group of Freedom Fighters led by the Xena-like warrior Jentorra (Katy O'Brian, chewing up her handful of scenes). Jentorra and her colorful band of misfits — including David Dastmalchian (returning to Ant-Man in a new role) as the sentient blob Veb and William Jackson Harper as a beleaguered telepath — are one of the few bright spots in Quantum Realm. Sadly, only so much screen time can be dedicated to them. Meanwhile, Hank and Hope (Evangeline Lilly, given absolutely nothing to do apart from rock a new haircut) are led on an illuminating tour through the Quantum Realm by Janet van Dyne, who appears to be terrified of returning to the realm she was stuck in for so long — and even more terrified of the tyrant who now rules it. Quantumania’s overstuffed plot could be forgiven if it could have lived up to the absurd humor of the first two films. One of the joys of the Ant-Man movies was how they were willing to be silly. Like the very dumb, wonderfully absurd ad in which Rudd and Douglas yell “Ants!” with increasing intensity, there was a go-for-broke humor in the first two movies that made them breezy to watch. That appears to have been completely lost by the time Quantumania rolls around. The same quips and self-aware banter are there, but they’re excruciatingly creaky — as if they’re remnants of a 10-year-old script that was never punched up. Whereas other recent Marvel films had moved on from the Joss Whedon-style witticisms, Quantumania’s comedy seems to be stuck squarely in 2013, except that the jokes are delivered by dead-eyed actors tired of working opposite a blue screen. Jeff Loveness’ script moves efficiently at least, dutifully taking the characters from plot point A to point B, but everyone feels less like human beings than they do action figures moved around to fulfill various plot contrivances. The exceptions are Pfeiffer, whose PTSD-suffering Janet has the closest thing to a character arc in the film, and Majors, who makes arguably the most ludicrous performance choices ever seen in a Marvel film. Sporting two facial scars (mimicking the lines on the comic book character’s helmet) and a permanently quivering lip, Majors’ Kang may not yet feel like the kind of looming, intimidating threat that Thanos was, but he certainly feels the most absurd. Majors’ turn may best be described as “Eddie Redmayne’s whisper-talk in Jupiter Ascending” — absolutely bizarre and by far the most interesting thing in this gray slog of a movie. It shouldn’t have to be this way. The Ant-Man movies made their mark with their visual dynamism — all smash cuts and whip pans, which originated in Edgar Wright’s original vision and in director Peyton Reed’s comedy roots — so it stands to reason that Marvel’s most visually rich new world should be done justice by Quantumania. Combine that with a Star Wars-esque narrative and the pulpy cosmic stylings of the Quantum Realm’s various creatures, and it seems like a recipe for success. Instead, the Quantum Realm is mildly interesting-looking at best and a bunch of CGI muck at worst, as if Marvel ran “pulpy space opera” through an algorithm and slapped a gray filter on it. When the movie tries to lean into its goofiness, like the appearance of Corey Stoll’s giant deformed head as M.O.D.O.K., it just comes off as sad. Even Disney’s Strange Worlds, a mostly fine animated film playing in the same pulp space as Quantumania, looks better. The problem with Quantumania is that it’s not a movie, it’s a building block. There are three movies jostling for screentime within Quantumania — Scott and Cassie’s father-daughter story, Janet van Dyne’s repressed guilt over Kang’s origins, the Quantum Realm’s long fight to overthrow the tyrannical Kang — but they’re all overshadowed by the MCU of it all. Marvel movies have long become less like movies and more like feature-length commercials for the next thing, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is sadly the greatest embodiment of that. The result is an undercooked, overstuffed action movie that feels like a shadow of better pulpy adventure sendups before it."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," I’m not going to write a long intro explaining what you probably already know – that this is the first Marvel movie of the year, as well as the kick-off for Phase 5, which will eventually lead to another Avengers movie in 2025. No, you already know that, and if you’ve seen the previous two Ant-Man movies, then you generally will know the returning characters as well. After a brief prologue, we reunite with Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang, enjoying life in San Fran after saving the world and having written a book about his experiences as an Avengers. His daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has been getting into trouble as an activist, because she wants to do good, but she’s also inherited her grandfather’s brilliance, creating a beacon to reach into the Quantumverse. The beacon alerts something that pulls Lang, Evangeline Lilly’s Hope Pym/Wasp, Cassie, and Hope’s parents into the Quantumverse, where they’re seemingly stranded. Once there, Scott and Cassie are separated from the others, and they turn to a group they encounter, including more humanoid characters played by William Jackson Harper (Midsommar) and Katy M. O’Brian. As cool as things look (relatively speaking – read on), it’s some time before we get to anything resembling an actual plot. In fact, it's almost hour before we see Kang again, and that's when things start to get interesting as we learn of his interactions with Michelle Pfeiffer’s Janet Van Dyne while they were both stranded in the Quantumverse.  The casting of Jonathan Majors as Kang may in fact end up being Marvel Studios’ greatest achievement. I was slightly dubious after his appearance on the Loki series, but Quantumania gives us a chance to really see Kang as the unbeatable conqueror that have plagued the Avengers in comics for decades. Nothing makes me happier than knowing that he will play such a huge part in Phase 5, although it’s interesting how Marvel is taking a counter approach to Kang than how they introduced Thanos (hinting at him but saving him for Avengers: Infinity War).  Sure, Bill Murray does appear as someone named Krylar, who isn’t quite as evil as Kang, but he basically shows up and does Bill Murray, something that could have easily been cut out without losing much. He’s quickly forgotten once Kang shows up. Handled in a far more amusing way is M.O.D.O.K. (Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing), who is more tied into the Ant-Man movies than the comics version and helps add humor without detracting from the seriousness of what Scott Lang and his family are going through. In general, the best scenes tend to be between Majors and Pfeiffer, though the father-daughter relationship does act as the emotional core of the film, giving Scott and Cassie a good story arc for the movie. I generally liked how all the main characters were used, because Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas, especially, get a lot more to do, as does Newton’s Cassie, who I imagine will be a popular fave from this movie. The movie’s creature design and production design are impeccable with lots of intriguing ideas, although sometimes you can clearly see the seams from the green screen. Other times, my head was hurting from the amount happening on screen and all the bright flashing lights. At times, it feels like Peyton Reed is out of his depth, putting so much into the frame that many shots just looked like a complete mess. (It’s actually shocking that this was shot by Bill Pope, but clearly, so much was going on in the visual effects realm where he didn’t have quite the control.) With all the creatures and ships and a sequence that is clearly inspired by the Mos Eisley Cantina, it’s hard not to feel like you’re watching a Star Wars movie. Personally, I was always more into the Marvel Comics characters than Star Wars, so you can imagine how that detracted from my experience. The third act gets absolutely insane, although that also pays off from stuff that was set up along the way. I won’t spoil the tag scenes (of which there are two), but both of them seem to be setting up future appearances by Kang in the MCU rather than  offering us a hopeful “Ant-Man will return.” Presumably he will, maybe not in his own movie but in the next Avengers? Quantumania is the closest thing to Marvel’s Star Wars, which isn't necessarily a good thing, since it follows the George Lucas ethos of just throwing so much at the viewer that they’re too awed to notice the flaws. That’s the case, at least until Kang shows up, and then, it starts to go into more interesting directions. I could definitely see this MCU installment being more divisive, but I expect most to agree that Majors is great."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Ant-Man has long been one of Marvel’s preferred franchises when it comes to mixing up the house formula in small ways that have big implications. The first two movies’ balance of light tone, sweet family heart, low-stakes heist action, and sci-fi mumbo jumbo went hand-in-hand with Guardians of the Galaxy in establishing a slice of sci-fi comic-book life that can be entertaining in ways that go far, far beyond epic superhero flair. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania tosses almost all of that aside in favor of trying to be the next big Marvel event thing you have to watch in theaters right now, please. Marvel made their third and possibly final Ant-Man (and the Wasp) movie into a prologue of their next, big step forward in a post-Avengers: Endgame world. If only they had just focused on making an Ant-Man movie. Not a redux of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 by way of Rick and Morty and now wanted by the police for plagiarizing Ralph McQuarrie. And sure, all that should sound as enticing as the title Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, itself. Now there’s a movie that gets what it is and what people should hope it to be, right there in the title. But even the tiniest expectations are set up to fail once said Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) get roped into a family adventure deep inside the quantum realm that goes about as well as Disney’s Strange World. It’s been a few years since Scott Lang (Ant-Man) helped save the universe, and recently he’s been resting on his laurels. Writing books, taking pictures with dogs, and trying to make up for lost time with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), who aged five years into a teenager while he was trapped in the “Quantum Realm,” or a different part of it? The movie never really explains this well, because before long, he and the rest of the Ant-Family — rounded out by Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer, with far more to do this time around) — get summoned to the Quantum Realm against their will. Only it’s not the Quantum Realm we’ve seen in previous movies, where characters shrink down to sub-atomic levels where giant worm-like creatures roam empty, gelatinous wastelands. Now, we have an explanation for why and how characters can survive for even 30 years in this universe. Because it is another universe “under” our own. And honestly, it’s kind of a boring one? The Marvel machine knows well and good that their cosmos movies (Guardians, Thor: Ragnarok, etc.) have a specific energy and look and style that fans find both familiar and engaging. Copy/pasting this style onto a sub-atomic universe probably makes sense when it comes to consistency, but it makes for an underwhelming, been-there-seen-that world. It doesn’t help that so much of the environment is manufactured that instead of a green screen, it’s like we’re in a green box. Characters are precariously stilted as they wander around in this 3D space that they clearly aren’t in. It’s maybe only modestly more convincing than the Star Wars prequels. What’s worse is that the movie carelessly throws in haphazard time travel exposition and multiversal madness that never satisfyingly connects to the whole “secret universe” pastiche, complete with our saga big bad, Kang (Jonathan Majors), who makes a compelling case for why he can be the next Thanos, in the sense that he’s actually an intimidating threat and seriously unhinged both in his actions and in his own brand of villainous philosophy. Turns out if you exist outside of time long enough, every universe and the lives therein lose weight and value to your warped, unnatural experiences. He’s like the protagonist of a video game where everyone else is a disposable NPC. (Note: you should probably watch Loki if you haven’t, already, at least if you expect more of an explanation for what’s going on with this guy). Too bad he’s in a movie that’s even more chaotic than him. The good news is that this chaos often breeds a smile or even a heavy chuckle at times, thanks mostly to some of the new (and returning) characters who float in to liven up an otherwise robotic story about making the most of messing up, or something. Marvel is still pretty good at making their mishap movies entertaining enough to sit through at least once. For a movie branded “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” there’s almost no Ant-Man with the Wasp, as the two are usually split up and have no arc or emotional issues to sort out this time around. On the one hand, it’s kind of nice to just avoid the contrived “now we need him being too awkward to propose!” storyline or something equally embarrassing. They’re just a happy couple, no drama, no fuss. The relationship issues are wisely kept to Scott struggling to parent a rebellious teenager who wants to do more good in the world, which…actually, that’s not that interesting, either.

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," There have been a few linchpins in the story of Marvel Comics, whether single issues or massive events, that have helped it become the exact ambitious and ever-evolving superhero epic that it is today. None might be as telling of what Marvel's future was going to entail as 1962's Tales to Astonish #35 — the first issue in which Hank Pym, an unassuming scientist who had debuted in the book eight issues prior, suited up as the costumed, size-changing Ant-Man. In that single moment, Tales of Astonish helped show that the terrifying and ridiculous tropes of its creature features and speculative science fiction could successfully carry over into a superhero tale. Over 60 years later, Ant-Man's latest appearance, this time in the live-action Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, is proving to be just as significant a combination of tones. The film is not only the third ""act"" in the almost decade-long Marvel Cinematic Universe journey of Ant-Man, but it is a forecast of what's on the horizon — kicking off Phase 5 of the franchise's storytelling, and fully teeing up its biggest Big Bad yet, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). It would be a lot to ask any of Marvel's existing superhero franchises to carry that latter burden, but in the hands of Quantumania, it proves to be a fun challenge in nearly every way. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an eccentric and essential spectacle, which further expands the possibilities of what the MCU's tentpole projects can still be capable of. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania follows the Lang and Van Dyne families in their new post-Blip status quo — Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has coasted on his success as an unlikely Avenger (complete with a memoir that will soon be an actual book later this year), Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) has utilized size-changing Pym particles for a combination of science and philanthropy, and Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) has gotten older, wiser, and more prone to trouble. When the three of them, alongside Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), accidentally get thrown into the Quantum Realm, they must find their way home all while dealing with the machinations of Kang, who has lived up to his title as ""The Conqueror"" and molded the small domain in his image. Comparisons have (and will continue to be) made between Quantumania and sci-fi juggernauts like Star Wars, which director Peyton Reed helmed multiple episodes of in between the second and third Ant-Man films, and Rick & Morty, which screenwriter Jeff Loveness previously wrote on. While those ties aren't entirely unwarranted, they sell short the movie's exact brand of weirdness — if anything, there are clearer shades of both Alejandro Jodorowsky and David Lynch's infamous adaptations of Dune, and of the outlandish B-Movies that were a dime a dozen when Ant-Man first appeared in the comics. Yes, some viewers' mileage with Quantumania's weirdness, and with some of the jokes that surround it, might vary. Yes, the film does contain some of the strangest visuals and running gags of anything Marvel has put on screen. But when the dust settles, that bizarreness largely works in the Quantumania's favor — whether it's Ant-Man and The Wasp using visually absurd gimmicks in their superheroics, or Kang going to the most dramatic extent possible to get what he wants, Quantumania often unfolds exactly like a previously unseen chapter of Marvel's Silver and Bronze Age comics is playing out on the screen before you. That exact quality still feels rare in the decade-and-a-half-long venture MCU, and it feels especially satisfying when neither party at the center of the film's conflict has fought each other in this exact context. The idea of Kang going up against the Ant-Man family has perplexed even the most trusting of MCU fans ever since Majors' casting was first announced in late 2020, but that juxtaposition — between the cozy, smaller-scale stakes of the previous Ant-Man movies, and the astronomical threat that Kang has posed in the comics — only makes things more enthralling. Granted, it does take some time to get to that point, with one long stretch of the second act ping-ponging back and forth between incremental dumps of exposition. But the narrative tension is palpable once Kang fully enters the picture, and even when certain scenes are incredibly predictable or reverential to another sci-fi staple, you still have no idea exactly how things are going to unfold. All the while, that conflict creates space for some surprising themes, tackling the dichotomy of empathy and apathy in an unexpected way, and even veering towards meta commentary about the entire MCU franchise and its relationship with stakes and spoilers. Quantumania is truly an ensemble piece, and almost all of the members of its cast are given an opportunity to genuinely shine. Despite Scott now being one of the longest-running veterans still around the MCU, Rudd's performance feels just as consistently charming and grounding as it did in 2015's Ant-Man. By his side — arguably much more so than Lilly's Hope, who, despite her name being on the marquee, largely has a supporting reactionary role in the proceedings — is Newton's Cassie. Even as the third actress to play Cassie in less than a decade, Newton brings a specific scrappiness and earnestness to every single scene, to the point where it feels like we've watched her exact take on the character grow up in front of our eyes. Douglas and Pfeiffer are true to form, but Pfeiffer (rightfully) gets to stand out, showcasing many complex qualities of comic-accurate Janet Van Dyne in spite of the dire circumstances she has endured. And entire odes will be written about Majors' take on Kang, who turns the extravagant and otherworldly energy from the page into something truly magical, to the point where even the slightest tilt of his head speaks volumes. It would be a crime not to mention Quantumania's technical prowess, which manifests in one of the most ambitious visual feasts that Marvel Studios has put out yet. While some footage from the film's marketing sparked comparisons to the campy surrealness of Robert Rodriguez's Spy Kids, the finished product only has a few sore spots of imperfect CGI or wonky depth of field. Once the story really starts escalating, the aesthetic elements manage to be shockingly immersive, thanks to clever feats of cinematography from Bill Pope and costuming from Sammy Sheldon. (The costume Sheldon creates for Kang is so effortlessly effective that it will be interesting to see if and how it evolves to inevitably sell more toys once Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars roll around). Christophe Beck's score ties it all together, bringing voice to the majestic and maddening sequences of the film. By and large, despite Ant-Man and The Wasp being some of the more grounded characters co-created by Jack Kirby, Quantumania is easily a contender for the most Kirby-esque visuals in a superhero adaptation. On paper, a lot of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania shouldn't and couldn't work — but just enough does work to make watching it a worthwhile experience. Even with the occasional narrative flaw and aesthetic misstep, the film unfolds in a matter that's not unlike feverishly reading through a forgotten Bronze Age comic book, eagerly experiencing whatever story crumbs or impossible visuals might be in store. With multiple standout performances, an abundantly clear love for the wacky corners of science fiction, and a conflict that is guaranteed to matter in the years to come, Quantumania becomes the weirdest and most wholehearted chapter in the MCU's essential storytelling."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has come a long way from his days as a struggling ex-convict; granted, joining The Avengers and traveling through time to save the whole of existence from a genocidal alien will do wonders for one’s reputation. And just in case you’re unaware of Scott’s heroic feats, don’t worry: he’s happy to tell you all about it, provided you haven’t already picked up a copy of his bestselling tell-all book.  When he’s not having his morning coffee comped by a cafe owner who frequently mistakes him for another bug-based hero, Scott spends time at home with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton) and their extended family: Scott’s girlfriend and fellow superhero Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and her parents, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). Everything seems peaceful, at least until Cassie’s latest invention goes haywire, shrinking the entire family to subatomic size and trapping them inside the quantum realm. As if that fate weren’t bad enough, returning to the quantum realm is especially dangerous for Janet; during her three-decade imprisonment there (before the events of 2018’s Ant-Man and The Wasp), she ran afoul of Kang (Jonathan Majors), a time traveling warlord with a score to settle.  Faithful fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe will have already been introduced to Kang during the first season of Loki. But whereas that appearance was little more than monologues and verbal sparring with Tom Hiddleston, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania establishes what a terrifying threat the intergalactic conqueror poses, not just to Scott and his family, but to the larger MCU. Majors, ever a captivating screen presence, brings a level of gravitas to the role that remains sorely missing from many of the villains that have faced off against Marvel superheroes on the big screen, and I look forward to seeing the various ways in which Kang will continue to threaten The Avengers, The Fantastic Four and the rest of the studio’s roster over the next few years. Visually, Quantumania is one of the most striking Marvel films yet; taking place almost entirely within the quantum realm allows for a massive and mostly blank creative canvas, and director Peyton Reed conjures up stunning landscapes, eye-popping colors and some truly bizarre creature designs. As with the two previous films, Reed also continues to find new ways to utilize Scott’s resizing abilities — which is a bonus, since there’s considerably more action this time around. And Reed even finds a way to utilize a classic Marvel comics villain, whom I never thought would appear in a live-action film, albeit with excruciatingly uncomfortable results (you’ll understand as soon as this character shows up, it’s disturbing on a primal level).  Regrettably, it’s the humor department where Quantumania really stumbles. Perhaps its just my fuzzy memory of the previous films, but it seems like this threequel has fewer jokes overall, and many of the existing ones fall flat; even a cameo appearance by a colossal comedic star fails to inspire laughs. Rudd’s everyman-turned-unlikely-hero shtick, which has served him so well in other appearances, feels constantly at odds with the heavier themes at play here. And some of those concepts, like the notion of fighting against injustices happening even when they don’t affect you directly, are given lip service but remain unsatisfactorily explored.  As an Ant-Man film, Quantumania feels a bit removed from its predecessors; not so much as to be entirely incongruous, mind you, but still a much different experience than Scott’s first two standalone outings. But as a proper introduction to the next intergalactic (and interdimensional) threat and table-setting for the future of the MCU, the film accomplishes its role with aplomb, even if its characters get short-changed in the process.

The ""Ant-Man"" films have long been the sub-franchise of the MCU most reserved as breather pieces. They've been charming, comedic little romps as positioned as a respite between the cacophonous crossovers and busy world-building of the brand at large. But ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,"" a title that suggests more of that levity, feels like a tipping point in the ongoing narrative surrounding the MCU.





Back in the spring of 2010, right before the release of ""Iron Man 2,"" Kevin Feige talked about his aspirations for building the first-ever shared cinematic universe of this scale. He insisted that ""...the movie that we are making comes first. [The] movies need to stand on their own. They need to have a fresh vision, a unique tone, and the fact that they can interconnect if you want to follow those breadcrumbs is a bonus."" With ""Quantumania,"" the 31st film in an ongoing series of interwoven stories that have since expanded to television and animation, a veil has been fully lifted on the ruse that Feige's words still hold true.
Ostensibly, ""Quantumania"" is the third act of a trilogy of films surrounding ex-con turned superhero Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and his partner/lover Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), but placed as it is as the curtain jerker for ""Phase Five,"" any real progression for the core cast of characters is suppressed to make the necessary space for introducing Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors), the next Thanos-level threat for the universe. Much like ""Captain America: Civil War,"" another third act that sidestepped properly following up on its prior outings to introduce Black Panther and a large-scale conflict between all the heroes, this film has to do the heavy lifting for the brand rather than do anything meaningful with its characters.





But where other instances of this phenomenon exist within the MCU, this might be the first one with so few redeemable qualities to justify the naked commerce at play. When you strip-mine something that's already so fleeting and threadbare and replace it with a feature-length trailer for a bigger movie years away, then what is the point?

In the never-ending war on internet spoiler culture, Disney and Marvel's review embargoes for critics often include riders not so politely imploring writers to leave plot specifics out of their coverage. But as time passes and each MCU film's ""plot"" becomes more and more abstract, it's hard not to think that's not just a ploy to avoid openly discussing what consistently turns out to be these films' weakest points. 





That said, ""Quantumania"" picks up after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame,"" where Scott's original idea to use the Quantum Realm to time travel and collect the Infinity Stones led to the saving of the universe and the return of the 50 percent of Earth's population that had been ""blipped."" Now he's famous, has written a book, and lives a happy-go-lucky life that looks nothing like the stress and graft of his former existence. But despite being recognized every day as a superhero, Scott does no superhero-ing. He claims he just wants to make up for lost time with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), and she just wants to be a superhero. She wants to make a difference. 
This conflict is mirrored between Hope and her mother Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who spent 30 years of her life trapped in the Quantum Realm but refuses to speak about what she experienced there. Janet, too, just wants to spend time with her daughter, but circumstances send the entire family (including Michael Douglas having a ball with more pithy work as Hank Pym) back to that place. The rest of the film is intended to be a phantasmagorical journey into the unknown, pitting the underdog heroes from the lowest stakes entries in the MCU against a threat that's set to headline the next two mega-budget ""Avengers"" films. 





Director Peyton Reed talked a big game about not wanting to be the palate-cleanser franchise for the MCU anymore, touting exciting-sounding visual influences for exploring the Quantum Realm, from Heavy Metal magazine to Jean Giraud. Screenwriter Jeff Loveness compared it to ""Jodorowsky's Dune!"" But the execution of those lofty goals leaves a lot to be desired. 
Roughly 95 percent of the film takes place in the Quantum Realm, with the opening eight minutes or so sprinting through the set-up at a ridiculous pace, all just so we can watch the cast walk around bland, muddy-looking environments that strike the visual distance between a filler episode of ""Rick and Morty"" and the Cantina scene from ""Star Wars."" The former comparison makes sense, as Loveness (who is also writing ""Avengers: The Kang Dynasty"") is a vet of the Adult Swim series, like other ex-pats from the Dan Harmon industrial complex who have made the jump from funnyman scribe to MCU architect. But as much as Reed seems to think he's finally making the cosmic epic he's been jealous of his peers helming, the result is something that absolutely would have been just fine as a Disney+ special.

""Quantumania"" clocks in at just over two hours, including two post-credits scenes (one laborious and laughable, the other solid enough), but instead of feeling like a lean summer blockbuster, it scans as a bloated episode of television. Anything meaningful we need to know about the main characters has happened off screen in between films. Scenes bounce from one to the next in the kind of hurry usually reserved for network procedurals, not even classy cable or streamer dramas. The genuinely compelling arc between the two sets of parent-child relationships that comprise the central family is truncated down to Cliff's Notes and only works half as well as they do because of this cast.





Paul Rudd continues to be endearing, as he is in literally everything, and he has strong enough chemistry with Newton as the kid he didn't get to watch grow up. Evangeline Lilly continues to get top billing despite the fact that most of her dialogue and screen time seems to have been misplaced somewhere in the edit. Michael Douglas is a riot in his own little way, but it's really Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet doing all the heavy lifting. It's hard to swallow that she's only front and center, reminding us how great she's always been, because her character has narrative proximity to Kang, the character for whom this entire feature is little more than a backdoor pilot.
Though his initial turn at the end of ""Loki"" Season 1 was intriguing enough to suggest he had some interesting tricks up his sleeve, Majors underwhelms here as the heavy. He's got presence for days, sure, but this variant of Kang is so underwritten, such a cardboard stock character, that no amount of handsome charm or menacing scowling is enough to make him feel special. 





Going into this film, it seemed as though Ant-Man was only getting sidelined to make space for an important figure who was going to breathe new life into the MCU after  But seeing the reality that Kang, within the confines of this picture and this picture alone, could be the villain of any lesser movie from 15 or 20 years ago, is pretty disconcerting. ""Quantumania,"" as its own singular viewing experience, would be considered slight and forgettable even if being consumed as a New Classic on TNT on a Tuesday night. Instead, it's a big and expensive tentpole picture made for little else than to herald the coming of the next slight and forgettable outing from this stretched-thin brand.
For how much longer are fans going to be expected to give the benefit of the doubt to middling, barely enjoyable movies meant for little more than passing the time between bouts of fan theories, analyzing production leaks, and being excited about future adaptations of classic comic book stories they've only consumed by skimming Wikipedia? Is this the innovation capitalism has wrought? Is this all ever going to end?
""Quantumania"" is the first of three theatrical releases and six television series the MCU has to offer in 2023. Let's see if anyone remembers any of them come 2026 when they're all supposed to finally pay off.

The MCU's Phase 5, the second phase of its Multiverse Saga, is finally here with ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania."" Phase 4 ably broached Marvel's multiverse in projects like ""Loki,"" ""Spider-Man: No Way Home,"" and ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness."" It also sought to grow Marvel's IP playground via heavy lore expansion, expanding the MCU's array of gods (""Moon Knight,"" ""Thor: Love and Thunder""), Eternals, and Celestials (""Eternals""). With all these factors in play, it's a key time to introduce the central villain of the MCU's Multiverse Saga, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). In ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,"" he's finally here in proper form.

Kang is one of the most interesting villains in Marvel's comic canon. A time-traveling conqueror, Kang spans the future and the past with ease. With the existence of a multiverse, Kang is nigh unstoppable for the simple reason that Kang is many. There have been many Kangs, just as Kang's evolution has produced wildly different iterations with differing goals. A time-altering, constantly multiplying, often self-conflicting villain, dealing with Kang is going to require the Avengers' very best ... or in this case, the very best of a size-altering family of heroes whose biggest collective accomplishment in the Quantum Realm (Kang's prison-turned-empire) is getting lost multiple times. They have their work cut out for them.

""Quantumania,"" Kang's shot-across-the-bow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), is variably successful towards the character's introduction. It broaches an interesting terrain in the Quantum Realm, evolves a great set of heroes, and introduces one of the most complex Marvel antagonists yet. For all its imagination, unfortunately, ""Quantumania"" also partially botches those introductions and the logic of said villain and universe. Jonathan Majors' Kang is fantastic, but we're given little new insight into him beyond ""he conquers stuff because Kang reasons."" There's some groundwork for the greatest Marvel villain yet, but it's sorely lacking in motive and development. Altogether the film is an engaging and fun start for the real meat of the Multiverse Saga, it's also one that needs more care and detail to flourish. This film is a fun missed opportunity.

""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" follows a new and improved Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) who's on top of the world and ready to dad. He's riding his post-Thanos-defeat fame, in a great relationship with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), and trying to spend as much time as with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton). As it turns out, Cassie's been working on a little Quantum Realm-mapping project along with Hope and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), one that sends a signal that then releases a black hole-like portal into the Quantum realm. The family gets separated, with Hank, Hope, and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) having to uncover secrets from Janet's past in the Quantum Realm, while Scott and Cassie encounter a group of rebels who face an existential threat from a time-exiled tyrant, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). Kang found himself stranded in the Quantum Realm, first via the sabotage of his ship's power source by his enemies and later by Janet van Dyne after her discovery of Kang's past murderous misdeeds. The Ant-crew needs to reunite and find a way to exit the Quantum Realm without letting Kang escape his vast, tiny subatomic prison.

Paul Rudd is as charming as ever as Scott Lang, now occupied with few thoughts of heroics beyond catching up on missed years of fatherhood and riding the wave of his post-Thanos fame. He lands the earnestness of the fish-out-of-water hero, here at least nominally outmatched by a massive threat. Michael Douglas's Pym is a rather laid-back source of humor that works (he just loves ants, y'all), while Pfeiffer ably showcases Janet's trauma and complexity (though her extreme lack of communication gets a bit tired as a plot device). Janet van Dyne is wonderfully performed, but too much of her story is merely avoiding truths and interesting choices. Kathryn Newton may be the third performer to portray Scott Lang's daughter Cassie, but she retains the joys and openness of her predecessors with a strong, if poorly planned, moral compass. It's a little difficult to see what role she'll play in a future team, given how here she's bumbling beyond her scientific skill, but it's a fun take on the character and her dynamic with Rudd's Scott Lang really works. 

The big show, of course, is the introduction of another variant of Jonathan Majors' conqueror Kang, our first true introduction to the Big Bad of the MCU's Multiverse Saga who truly does feel distinct from He Who Remains of ""Loki"" finale fame. Here, Kang has a measured gravitas that's intelligent and menacing in equal measure, at best when he's is losing control. Still, Kang is underdeveloped in catastrophic ways. Majors is great, but his character is introduced late and we get little insight into his motivations beyond reminders that Kangs seek to conquer the Multiverse because that's what Kangs do. We don't know or understand his character. Moreover, we're told he can create timelines and rewrite existence, and that he boasts technology hundreds of years beyond anything we've seen, but mainly we see Kang have beams and light telekinesis, and boast armies with ships and blasters ... all things we've seen, and he barely uses them in his brief shared runtime.
 ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" follows a new and improved Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) who's on top of the world and ready to dad. He's riding his post-Thanos-defeat fame, in a great relationship with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), and trying to spend as much time as with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton). As it turns out, Cassie's been working on a little Quantum Realm-mapping project along with Hope and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), one that sends a signal that then releases a black hole-like portal into the Quantum realm. The family gets separated, with Hank, Hope, and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) having to uncover secrets from Janet's past in the Quantum Realm, while Scott and Cassie encounter a group of rebels who face an existential threat from a time-exiled tyrant, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). Kang found himself stranded in the Quantum Realm, first via the sabotage of his ship's power source by his enemies and later by Janet van Dyne after her discovery of Kang's past murderous misdeeds. The Ant-crew needs to reunite and find a way to exit the Quantum Realm without letting Kang escape his vast, tiny subatomic prison.

""Quantumania"" boasts some interesting worldbuilding, offering our most expansive look into the Quantum Realm thus far and all its unusual attributes. It's a colorful, topsy-turvy world with novel characters. There are beautifully rendered space-scapes, suggesting the vastness of this novel universe beneath or within our own. While it is an exciting new playground full of unique characters, the CGI-heavy landscape does have the awkward side-effect of feeling like the sets are shallow — it always seems like the human characters are playing within a tight rectangle while the background is distant and digital, and some CGI is distractingly cartoonish at times (M.O.D.O.K., anyone?). Additionally, the actual logic of the Quantum Realm is still undercooked within the MCU thus far. If the rules are so different, why are its evolutionary pathways sometimes wildly different (sentient buildings?) and otherwise indistinguishable (e.g. a whole lot of human-looking entities)? Altogether, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun MCU entry that finally starts to feel like the new Saga is pointing somewhere interesting. Majors' Kang may be woefully underutilized with power that's explained but never truly shown, but his charisma and gravitas win the day for a strong performance that bodes well for the MCU's future. The rest of the film's talented performers deliver their roles well, and the world seems evidently well-designed and novel compared to what's come before. Still, most characters are underutilized, underdeveloped, or set into contrived circumstances. Major plot moments and character developments feel undercooked, and there are relevant moments where the story logic is lacking. The film boasts one of the MCU's most expansive visages but it somehow still feels blatantly shallow, like actors are recording in a glorified booth against a massive green screen. Nonetheless, there's a lot of fun, love for the world and its characters, and a tonal consistency that sets ""Quantumania"" easily above at least a couple Phase 4 outings. In the end, we're left with a strong Kang debut inside a film that's a mostly satisfying mine for future MCU success."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," Despite maintaining a firm position as the most financially successful film franchise of all time, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been chugging towards an undeniable and inevitable question for the last four years: is there a future for the franchise beyond Avengers: Endgame? Sure, there have been plenty of box officers winners for Marvel, but faith among fans that studio will be able to recapture the zeitgeist of Endgame – and their latest film, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has been positioned as the first true installment of Phase 5 in this new Avengers-level story. But despite another grand-slam of a villain casting decision in Jonathan Majors, Quantumania is an aimless, muddy, flat mess of a film that plays out as a charmless echo of Thor: Ragnarok. In looking so far ahead to set up the future of the franchise, Marvel has forgotten to put care in the films that are currently in theaters.  Starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania sees Scott Lang (Rudd) relishing a comfortable post-Endgame life as a generally well-liked public figure and a moderately successful book author. Though he’s content to hang up the suit and live a low-key life, his daughter Cassie (franchise newcomer Katherine Newton) longs to do the kind of good her father used to, enlisting the help of her grandfather Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and step-mother Hope (Lilly) to develop her tech. But when their experiment goes awry, Scott, Cassie, Hank, Hope, and Hank’s wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) are sucked into the Quantum Realm – a strange world living under the tyrannical reign of Kang the Conqueror.  Among the many high-stakes adventures of the MCU, Ant-Man films have previously found their niche as small-scale (no pun intended) heist-centric stories that blend humor and heart without getting too ambitious in terms of stakes. Though it may not churn out the most pulse-pounding entries in the franchise, the first two Ant-Man films have a charm to their tone thanks in large part to Paul Rudd and the self-deprecating, self-aware nature of the character and hero mantle. What’s so upsetting, then, is that Qunatumania deliberately and knowingly shirks this warmth in favor of using Ant-Man as a way to introduce Kang and set up future films – a sloppy but necessary move that robs the film of any remaining goodwill from the first installments. Marvel has come under fire before for its over-reliance on CGI sets and effects, but Quantumania is without question the most egregious example of the studio’s lacking visuals: the Quantum realm (the setting for the vast majority of the film) is a malformed, muddy CGI dreamscape full of uninspired Quantum creatures reminiscent of Star Wars aliens and uninspired fight scenes. Though Ant-Man’s power set (or lack thereof) doesn’t lend itself well to interesting choreography as is, the Quantum realm makes it all the more difficult to care about the outcome of any clash when the entire sequence is bathed in lackluster color and animation.  Just as muddied and lacking in artistry is the film’s script – though Quantumania hopes to anchor its emotional narrative to the bond between Scott and Cassie, Rudd and Newton simply don’t have chemistry, and the placeholder dialogue does no favors for the already weak performances. Though the cast certainly boasts plenty of talent, very few actors seem to be interested in the film they’re making – Michael Douglas is perhaps the only member of the Pym family whose enthusiasm and line delivery is convincing enough to rouse any kind of affection as an audience member.  Of the larger ensemble, the only real standouts are Katy M. O’Brien – a Quantum realm resident/revolutionary whose character design and story beats don’t amount to much more than a knockoff of Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie. Still, despite a cookie-cutter character, John-Kamen brings real fire and depth – a rarity among this cast that goes a long way to elevate otherwise lackluster dialogue.  Without question, though, the true scene-stealer and virtually the film’s only redeeming quality is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror – a character who makes his feature film debut after being teased in the finale of Loki season one. Though the setup surrounding his character is clunky and feels misplaced in a film that’s supposed to be about a reformed thief with the power to talk to ants, Majors gives 110% (as always) and turns Kang into a genuinely fearsome and memorable villain.  But even a star as bright as Majors’ can’t shine bright enough to eclipse just how unapologetically transitional and transactional Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is. This isn’t a film interested in exploring new facets of its heroes or even bringing a beloved comic arc to life – this is simply a vehicle by which exposition is pushed and groundwork can be laid for future installments.  In that respect, Quantumania isn’t even a film so much as it’s required reading for a story that’s growing less interesting by the minute. "
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Is Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania safe for kids? Is Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania OK for children? Read the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, an honest parents guide and mom review of the all-new Ant-Man 3 film sequel directed by James Cameron, starring Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, and Jonathan Majors. No spoilers! #AntManAndTheWaspQuantumania #AntMan3 May contain commissioned links. After a mediocre Phase 4, I have to admit that my expectations for the Kang Dynasty era are about as tiny as Scott Lang dancing in the Quantum Realm. But with Kevin Feige promising Ant-Man 3 as the perfect kick-off for Marvel’s next phase of movies and shows, perhaps a giant sized Pez dispenser curveball will have fans cheering for the upcoming 2023 releases. In this Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, I’m breaking down the visuals, the story, a full PG-13 age rating explanation for violence, adult themes and language, and what kids’ age recommendation is suggested to watch in this new 2023 Ant-Man 3 film sequel parents guide to the new Marvel Phase V. A no-spoiler parent review of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, does Paul Rudd bring the third sequel charm? Or is the Marvel Phase 5 going to be the start of yet another round of Phase 4? Quantum realm, meet IMAX screen. Per usual, the Marvel Cinematic Universe visuals are vividly astounding, especially when it comes to creating an entire CGI Quantum universe. Building a realm with unique creatures, landscapes and bright colors, Phase V is off to a colorful, creative and immersive experience for Marvel fans. However, even visuals can have a bad day. The Quantum realm seems to have gotten a facelift since we last saw it in Ant-Man 2. This 2023 Quantum realm is more reminiscent of Star Wars meets Strange World meets Avatar. It was hard to not compare the Quantum Realm to other worlds and galaxies we’ve seen on the big screen before. And what should have easily been it’s own unique visual footprint became a muddled second cousin of other films, distracting me at times from the story. The Quantum realm creatures resembled Star Wars creatures or Mysterio clones. Even some of the Quantum realm costuming reminded me of Hoth rebel soldier uniforms. Photosensitivity Warning. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is NOT for those with photosensitivity issues. Multiple scenes throughout the film have bright flashing lights and strobing effects. I strongly urge Marvel fans to heed this warning, because of the quantum realm nature and the Marvel use of CGI and visual effects. They’re back in the saddle again. Paul Rudd (“Clueless“) and Evangeline Lilly (“Lost“) reprise their super hero icons as Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne in the official kick off for Marvel’s Phase V, The Kang Dynasty. Along with Michael Douglas (“The American President“), Michelle Pfeiffer (“Batman Returns“) and Kathryn Newton (“Pokémon Detective Pikachu“) as Scott’s daughter Cassie, the family sets off on a new sci-fi adventure in the Quantum Realm – ultimately facing Jonathan Majors (“The Last Black Man in San Francisco“) as Kang the Conqueror. The plot thickens for our beloved heroes as family secrets are revealed in one of the most unusual places, the Quantum Realm. Dynamics change and lots of questions get answered as the story unfolds. And this is when Marvel lost me. The Quantum Realm has only traces of the DNA it once had back in Ant-Man and the Wasp movie. Taking on a completely different persona (yes, I feel the Quantum Realm is it’s own character), the landscape shifted from a Marvel superhero film into a Star Wars: The Last Jedi/Avatar/sci-fi spoof. The creatures, the costuming, the weapons, the overreaching and overused sci-fi story tropes – it all felt very familiar and yet at the same time disappointing. With most of the movie completely immersed in CGI, Ant-Man, the most relatable of the Avengers, is no longer grounded in reality. The family relationship dynamics feel forced. The jokes, the goofiness, the fun-loving Scott Lang is missing – as the little guy with no powers and a super suit faces off with one of the most powerful Marvel villains ever. And I don’t understand the matchup. And sadly, that’s not all that I don’t understand in this sequel. Is Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania safe for kids? With little guy Paul Rudd in charge of the official kick-off for Marvel Phase 5, should parents be concerned? As we all know, not every Marvel release is the same. And with Marvel pushing the envelope on TV-14 and PG-13 ratings these days (remember an almost TV-MA rated Werewolf By Night special presentation, an overly adult themed She-Hulk series or the shocking horror Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness film?), some say that kids are no longer welcome to the Marvel super hero party. Is Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania too scary for kids? Or is this more of the Marvel predictable age rating like the original Ant-Man films that parents and kids love? Why is Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania rated PG-13? In this Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, Marvel’s Ant-Man 3 film sequel is rated PG-13 for “violence/action and language.” With film and TV ratings also unpredictable these days, having fully disclosed parent guidelines can help determine if a movie or television show like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is kid friendly. Is Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania too scary for kids? Let’s breakdown that PG-13 age rating in this Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania parents guide. Violence/Suspense. Holy violent sequel, Batman. Who stole house arrest Scott Lang and traded him in for Bucky? Reminiscent of more of the serious The Falcon and the Winter Soldier scenes than of the goofy Scott Lang, the intensity of the violence and suspense really threw me for a quantum loop for an Ant-Man sequel. Besides the normal use of sci-fi weapons and guns, it’s the hand-to-hand combat that really needs a spotlight here as Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania may be too violent for kids. More blood, more gore, more human dismemberment, facial disfigurement, torture, and death, it’s the kind of uncomfortable violence that you would expect from a boxing movie, not a Marvel super hero film. While most of the really intense violence occurs towards the end of the film, it’s enough to leave a lasting impression, especially for kids. Add in 2 possible jump scares (both very mild overall), and I would say that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has more violence than the other 2 Ant-Man films – combined. Adult Themes. Overall, adult themes are pretty mild in this film. Alcohol is present – with a 6-pack of beers being consumed and 1 champagne toast. One bar scene with a line asking to get “drunk.” Ant-Man 3 has mild verbal sexual innuendo comparable to Shrek, that may or may not go over the heads of children. Discussion of human “needs,” “holes,” and other mild language used for humor purposes and punchlines. Sexual content also includes 2-second scene of a naked butt – NOT disclosed in the MPAA rating, I might add. Hugging between characters is the only physical touch seen in the film. Language. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is officially the Marvel film with the most foul language ever. At least, if you consider some of these words to be considered “bad.” But let’s dive in. Swear words include 4 uses of “d1ck,” 4 “sh!t,” 1 “@sshole,” 3 “d@mn,” and about 20-30 uses of “h-e-double-hockey-sticks.” Yes, you heard me right. At least 20. I honestly lost count because of the word overlap. (It will make sense when you see the film.) At a runtime of 2 hours 5 minutes, this Ant-Man 3 film sequel is exactly 7 minutes longer than the Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp movies, right in the sweet spot for Avengers loving kids, without going over the 3-hour Endgame mark for restless wiggle worms.But add in intense violence, innuendo and increased language – I would sadly say that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the least kid-friendly of the Ant-Man movie trilogy. Star Wars meets Marvel, anyone? Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is most comparable to Thor: Love and Thunder. It’s a decent Marvel sequel, but not quite on the level of Thor: Ragnarok. The Star Wars and Avatar themes though, from creatures to costuming to overused sci-fi tropes. In one word – WHOA. It’s a Marvel movie, so DUH. Yes, 2 end credit scenes. 1 mid-credit scene and 1 end credit scene at the VERY, VERY end. Marvel fans will appreciate staying in their seats until the very last second. Based on my Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania parents guide and mom review above, this parent movie reviewer would not recommend Ant-Man 3 for kids younger than the age of 10-11 years old. This Ant-Man film is the most mature of the saga with more intense violence, added sexual innuendo and increased language. Considering the full PG-13 rating breakdown above, this parent movie reviewer would not recommend Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania for kids younger than the age of 10-11 years old.This Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania rating is most comparable to Avengers: Endgame. I still recommend parents to prescreen Ant-Man 3 for intense violence, sexual innuendo and increased intense language. If your kids have seen and love the Ant-Man film series, then they will love Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Just keep in mind that this Ant-Man sequel is the “most mature” of the bunch. Well, “there’s always room to grow.” And for a 3rd Ant-Man film, I think the little guy forgot to bring a “little” more humanity and audience relatability to the party. The reality is, the reality was missing in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. But stunning visuals cannot save overdone sci-fi adventure themes and a story that ultimately disconnects the audience from the characters we’ve grown to love. That’s not to say that overall this is a bad sequel. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a decent sequel. But is a Thor: Love and Thunder level sequel really what we should expect from Marvel moving forward in this Phase? Because I want more Thor: Ragnarok level sequels, Shang-Chi surprises, and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever emotions. The only thing that shrank here is my super hero sized expectations. And at this stage of the MCU game, decent is disappointing. Marvel can and should have done better.

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the start of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Phase 5 and it is ushered in with a sense of high stakes and dread, something that is very new to the Ant-Man franchise. These films have always been silly and fun, they do star the hilarious Paul Rudd, after all. Separating him from his group of ex-con friends and sending him into the depths of the Quantum Realm and putting him up against one of the greatest villains of all time, Kang the Conqueror, proves to add urgency and intensity to his story.  In Ant-Man and the Wasp, Janet Van Dyne was rescued after thirty years in the Quantum Realm, however she really didn’t have too much to say about it. When secrets are revealed, Scott and his family are sucked into the realm, quite literally, and she must help get them through it, using the connections she made when she lived there. A whole new world, worlds even, is discovered — answering one of the biggest questions we were left with after the second film — where did she get that cloak?

In all seriousness though, it is is incredible to see what is discovered down there. Based off of actual microscopic photos, this world feels very much like Marvel meets Star Wars. The MCU has given us films like Guardians of the Galaxy that take place in space, and while the sets certainly have a similar design, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania takes things to a whole new level.  This world that we live in for the majority of the film is absolutely stunning. The CGI is on point after it finds its footing in the second act (and trust us, we looked for issues all the way through). Viewers are introduced to a variety of new characters, most of which are insanely bizarre, but in a really fun way (Veb, anyone?). They are essentially aliens, even though technically this whole movie could be taking place in someone’s fingernail. It is easy to lose yourself in the backgrounds of this movie, looking at all of the gorgeous scenery. The VFX team really knocked it out of the park, and they should be recognized for that.

A movie can be beautiful to look at, but have an awful story though, so thankfully Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has a good one. Scott has missed a lot of his daughter’s life because of jail and getting blipped out of existence, so in this film he is trying to make up for lost time as best as he can. Those who know about Kang, know that he is the master of time so that is something he can give back to Scott. There are parallels drawn throughout the film between his lost time with Cassie, and Janet’s lost time with Hope that really work within the movie. Both parents are mourning this loss, but so are the kids. Living without a parent is not easy and they have a lot of making up to do. Can they be tempted by Kang’s offers? Well, you will just have to watch the movie to find out. There are also some other great lessons here, like about looking out for the little guy (conveniently the title of Scott Lang’s book — which yes, it’s real!) and helping out when you can. Some people just can’t be selfish, even when they really want to be. This is a reoccurring theme when it comes to Scott, but also when it comes to Cassie, as she has some great words to inspire MODOK. When it comes to the father-daughter relationship, Kathryn Newton stepping in as Cassie Lang was a great choice. We aren’t sure why they didn’t go with the actress they recently used, but Newton has proven herself more than once that she is worthy of fantastic roles. When audiences see her suit up they will be thrilled, because not only does it feel like she has a genuine connection with this cast, she kicks some serious butt.

Speaking of suiting up, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is sure to give fans more than just a heartwarming story, it brings a whole lot of action as well. The first act drags on a little long, but once we finally get into the Quantum Realm and the nitty-gritty of it all, there are some truly epic battle sequences. Ant-Man’s ability to shrink and grow always adds a bit of fun to the fights, and with a whole collection of superheroes with the same power joining forces, the action is a really good time.  These moments are sprinkled throughout the film, which helps to keep things moving along. Thankfully the two hour runtime is never really felt, despite the movie taking a little while to get going.  The clear standout of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror. This really should come as no surprise to anyone who watched his performance in Loki as He Who Remains. The man is extremely talented and to be able to play a different version of the same character (a variant, if you will) and do it so well is no easy feat. We don’t want to get into heavy spoilers, but just know there are several versions in this movie, and Majors adds something new and unique to each one. It is incredible to watch on screen, and fans of his will be in awe of his talent. Kang steals the show with his interactions with each of the main characters in this movie. He is terrifying and bone-chilling, certain to give the audience literal goosebumps when he talks. Kang is a bad guy, there is no doubt about that, and easily one of the best MCU villains yet. Phase 5 is titled The Kang Dynasty after all, and Majors has earned this role and importance in the future of the MCU ten fold. While he is phenomenal opposite everyone, his time shared on screen with Michelle Pfeiffer is some of the best work seen in a while. They play off each other perfectly and you can’t help but eat up their performances.

Photo by Jay Maidment. © 2022 MARVEL. This movie is not all sunshine and rainbows though, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has its issues. We already talked about the first act feeling like a bit of a struggle, which thankfully corrects itself once the second act hits. However, there are some other things that don’t work very well. Once the family enters the Quantum Realm, it feels like you are dropped into the middle of an already progressing story that you somehow missed part of. There is a war going on, and it takes a little while to catch up and become familiar with the story. Not necessarily a bad thing, but some viewers might feel a bit lost at first. The new characters that we are introduced to, specifically Quaz and Jentorra, are integral to the story but it takes far too long to warm up to them because of this.  Bill Murray plays Krylar and we cannot help but think that he was originally a much bigger part of the story. He is deemed as problematic now and his part could have easily been edited down. If this is not the case, which is possible, he was still very underused and something was… off about his part. Seems like such a major name in the industry is very underused in this film. However, what we do get of him is a lot of fun and provides some good laughs. Speaking of laughs, Ant-Man has always been the comedic relief of the high stakes MCU, so to have some weight added to his story is new for everyone, and it does take some getting used to. His friend group of ex-cons (Luis, Kurt, and Dave) are certainly missed. It feels strange to have an Ant-Man movie without them, but at least viewers will still find themselves laughing during this movie. Here’s the thing about M.O.D.O.K. — he is going to be a love or hate part of this story, much like the goats in Thor: Love and Thunder. Some people found them to be absolutely hilarious and the longer the joke went on, the more they laughed. Others could not stand them, and we have even seen people say they were by far the worst part of that movie. On paper, when you look at what M.O.D.O.K. actually is in this film (we don’t want to give it away for those who don’t know because it works much better as a surprise), he should not work. But he ends up delivering some of the best lines in the movie, as ridiculous as they are. His design is incredible — the colors, the blades, the suit — look fantastic on screen. His role in the movie is fantastic, and actually important.  However some people will certainly feel like he was done dirty as he isn’t exactly how comic book readers might imagine. That said, he is pretty close to it. Think about it. Still, M.O.D.O.K. is going to be a big miss for some fans, while being a standout character for others. When it comes to the mid and end credit scenes in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, they are not an ant playing drums. These are important for the MCU moving forward and absolutely worth staying in your seat for. The film clocks in at just two hours and moves at a pretty great pace, so it won’t be a struggle to do this. This movie is very much a set up for what is to come in Phase 5 and both of these scenes are integral to what comes next. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the start of Phase 5 of the MCU and it kicks it off with heart, action, and stunning visuals. There are a lot of new and bizarre characters to meet in a world that feels very much Marvel meets Star Wars. The story is about lost time with family, and there are sure to be moments that touch each and every person. At the same time, they did not skimp out on the action.  Everyone is incredible in their roles, but it comes as no surprise that Jonathan Majors is the standout. Kang the Conqueror is a terrifying villain and he steps into this role perfectly. Kathryn Newton is also new to the MCU, and she does a wonderful job as Cassie as well. It seems that every main character has their moment to kick some butt and come to the rescue, which is really nice to see. While it is not a perfect movie, it is a great starting point for The Kang Dynasty. Things are not left on a happy note, and Kang is clearly just getting started. We cannot wait to see how it all plays out, as we move into the future of the MCU. Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope’s parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott’s daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible. Directed by Peyton Reed and produced by Kevin Feige, p.g.a. and Stephen Broussard, p.g.a., “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” also stars Jonathan Majors as Kang, David Dastmalchian as Veb, Katy O’Brian as Jentorra, William Jackson Harper as Quaz and Bill Murray as Lord Krylar.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," “Worlds within worlds.” That’s the well-worn descriptor—Quotation? Catchphrase? Cliché? Really, that universal catch-all-three “from the comics”—one character uses to characterize the primary setting of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. The characters are goggling at the previously glimpsed and now heavily explored Quantum Realm, a beyond-microscopic section of the Marvel Cinematic Universe reachable only by advanced (and dangerous) shrinking technology. Ten years ago, though, this phrase might have applied to the MCU’s numerous overlapping mini-franchises, Iron Man’s world not quite the same as Captain America’s which was not quite the same as Thor’s—until they pulled a few narrative threads together and converged into The Avengers. Now, it could also apply to the way the MCU seems obligated, whether by due dates, artistic conviction, or pure high-roller self-confidence, to paste together its wonders with green-screen, dim lighting, and suspiciously empty one-shots. Whenever it’s possible to look at Quantumania and idly wonder whether anyone on screen was actually in a room together during shooting—which is often!—you may be peeking at the worlds-within-worlds built by visual effects artists and actors’ conflicting schedules. In other words: a Zoom call with (somewhat) better backgrounds. Before they’re all sucked into the Realm, Quantumania calls back to its predecessors, following a happy-go-lucky Scott through some family bickering and a handful of cute gags, attempting to take advantage of Rudd’s ingratiating disbelief that he’s actually a big-time superhero. That’s the kinda-sorta character obstacle Quantumania sets up in its opening moments: Having played a key role in the saving of the universe in Avengers: Endgame, Scott is happily resting on his laurels, reading from his bestselling book and irritating his daughter Cassie, who yearns to right more of the world’s wrongs as her dad urges her toward a more normal life. A superhero allowing himself to believe his own savior hype was a potent catalyst for Sam Raimi’s uneven but intermittently brilliant Spider-Man 3; maybe that’s why someone mistakes Scott for Spidey early on. Once everyone’s gone quantum-sized, Scott and Cassie have a little more opportunity to clash over this issue, as they’re separated from the rest of the group and encounter a ragtag group of various life forms attempting to resist the conquering efforts of a fearsome man-or-something called Kang (Jonathan Majors). They have their moments; Rudd and Newton have an innate sweetness that sells the father-daughter stuff despite Newton only playing Cassie in one previous Avengers film (blip, time-jump, etc.). But Reed flouts his neo-screwball roots and never mines anyone’s conflicting ideologies, such as they are, for truly comic conflict. The movie’s version of playing nice is keeping the verbal conflict to light yet unfunny sniping. Meanwhile, Hope and Hank make their way through this new world relying on the expertise of Janet, who was stuck in the Realm for three decades but has kept mum about her time there. (Those Marvel NDAs are a bitch.) The dual-track Quantum Wanderings allow for a bunch of weird-looking Cantina-grade alien equivalents to saunter across the screen, sometimes for a weak gag and sometimes for the sheer pleasure of population-as-scenery, and look, I’m not made of stone. I enjoyed seeing, say, a creature who looks like a broccoli-man hybrid, even if he might have been more delightful without his resemblance verbally underlined by a member of the cast, or seen in full, high-contrast light, rather than the murk that so often overtakes the movie’s field of vision, despite ace cinematographer Bill Pope—who also shot Spider-Man 3, come to think of it. At least the visual-effects characters aren’t fumbling around in the dark quite as piteously as the actors. They’re fed such a deadening mixture of filler non-jokes (“it’s a whole thing”), boilerplate heart-to-heart (“I get it, I do”), and bad comic-book exposition (Michelle Pfeiffer finally gets more than a few lines, and she’s forced to half-explain Kang) that it takes a Bill Murray-level personality to steal the lines away and make them sound like anything remotely human. Is it fortunate, then, that the movie does actually cast Murray in a supporting role, and he does briefly wrestle a bunch of glorified outline scribbles into submission? Or is it just desperation? Frankly, I’ll take some desperation at this point—anything to make it feel like something is coming to a head in one of these movies. That’s supposed to be what’s happening with Kang; instead, the movie has Jonathan Majors, an actor of rare charisma and intensity, stuck giving a preview of performance: A sneak peek of what he might really do as Kang down the line. Rather than offer a true temptation to Scott, who has lost years of his daughter’s youth, he gestures vaguely toward the intriguing and entirely undeveloped idea of linear time as a prison and a curse. Maybe another movie will elaborate on that someday and locate some kind of genuine pathos in all of this timestream/multiverse worldbuilding-withing-worldbuilding. (Describing what Kang’s powers actually entail appears to have been deferred as well. In the meantime, you’ll never guess how they manifest here: He shoots laser-blasty things!) That Ant-Man, rather than Iron Man, now gets to muse about whether Kang might return in the future is supposed to count as an internal promotion. Murky visuals, weak laughs, endless coming attractions…if the same complaints about the MCU are beginning to bore you, just imagine how it feels when the movie itself feels so insistent on building them in. There’s one advantage to the MCU’s… let’s keep calling it consistency for now: It really doesn’t take much to shock me back to attention. When Sam Raimi brought some genuinely memorable visual ideas into Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, I practically wept with gratitude; there was a superhero blockbuster unruly enough to be fun, even across its rough patches. Right down to its title, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania plays like an instant knockoff of the Raimi movie, with far less of that pesky filmmaking to get in the way. That periodic Ant-Man zip of rapidly shifting sizes and scales remains, and, as with the other two movies, manages to stick around for much of the climax, which is not the case for every or even most MCU movies. These are the small favors the non-devout must contend with now, and they’re looking bigger all the time."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," The Marvel Cinematic Universe is ever expanding, and with the start of Phase Five, it’s gotten both bigger and smaller. Yes, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the largest scale installment of the character’s now trilogy, but it’s done so by getting so small, it enters the Quantum Realm. Starting this MCU section off with Ant-Man is an interesting choice, and while it doesn’t always pay off, more here works than doesn’t. It’s not Marvel’s upper echelon, but it’s an entertaining science fiction adventure, even if it’s a bit of a bumpy ride. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the closest the MCU has gotten to a Star Wars film yet. In fact, I felt a little bit of a Rick and Morty influence as well. All of this makes for one of the weirder Marvel movies to date. Newcomers to this world will be lost, but if you’re at least mostly up to date, it’s a definite step towards something a bit new for the interconnected universe. Life is good for Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), known the world over as the superhero Ant-Man. He’s got a book out, receives kudos everywhere, and just generally is enjoying things. Sure, his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) is causing a little trouble, but she’s also working with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) on a map of the Quantum Realm. Scott is impressed, as is Hope Van Dyne / The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), but Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) is horrified. Before she can shut the machine down, they’re sucked in, returning to the Quantum Realm, potentially stuck for good. Exploring the Quantum Realm, Scott and Cassie are separated from Hank, Hope, and Janet, with both groups meeting various residents of the realm. As the other four discover the whole ecosystem and population within, Janet reveals secrets from her time here previously. Not only do those include how she survived, but an all-powerful being known as Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors). Kang has taken over the realm, utilizing a deadly weapon he’s created named M.O.D.O.K. (Corey Stoll). He also needs Pym Particles to escape, so he seeks to use Scott under duress. Thus begins a fight for the Quantum Realm, as well as a battle to keep Kang from entering our realm.  Jonathan Majors is going to be a force to reckon with in the MCU. Kang hasn’t fully been set up as the overall big bad yet, but Majors gives the character here a strong point of view. If there’s an evolution that continues, something special could eventually be in store for us. Paul Rudd is his reliable self, while Michelle Pfeiffer steals many of her scenes. My personal MVP is Kathryn Newton, showcasing charm and going toe to toe with Rudd, but your mileage may vary. Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly get a little under-served, but they’re a part of a solid ensemble, with Corey Stoll having a lot of fun as M.O.D.O.K. throughout. Supporting players include William Jackson Harper, Bill Murray, Katy M. O’Brian, Randall Park, and more. Director Peyton Reed occasionally seems lost within all of the CGI, resulting in one of the less Marvel works, visually, but writer Jeff Loveness is working overtime to explain more about Kang, the multiverse, and the Quantum Realm. It’s often messy (there’s a long section in the middle that seems largely unneeded), but it comes together nicely when it matters, either with a well-timed joke, set-piece, or just cool MCU moment. They lean in to the absurdity of Ant-Man and his crew being who has to go up against Kang, so while it’s an odd fit, it generates some decent sized stakes. As mentioned above, there’s a slight Rick and Morty vibe to some of the creatures, which makes sense considering Loveness writes on the show. Between he and fellow alum of the animated program Michael Waldron, who penned Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, there’s an influence that’s not going any anytime soon, as they’re each doing one of the upcoming two Avengers flicks, Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (Loveness), and Avengers: Secret Wars (Waldron). So, get used to it. It works for me, at least. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is mid-tier Marvel. For some, that may mean it’s a disappointment. For others, it won’t matter one bit. I found myself consistently entertained, even if aspects of it were more successful than others. The MCU is getting set to fully unleash Kang on us, and if Majors can really get a chance to play, we’re going to have a compelling villain to watch fight our favorite heroes."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Welcome back the teeny-tiny superhero whose main superpower is Paul Rudd&apos;s outsized charm&#44; while his main weakness is that everybody&apos;s always belittling him -- even the creators of his own movie&#46;
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Even though Ant-Man saved the world in Avengers: Endgame (or maybe it was the rat who was the true hero), he's never really had that much importance in the MCU – until now. Ant-Man and Ant-Man and The Wasp were mere palate cleansers after an Avengers movie, with little to do with the wider universe. Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, though, is the first outing of Phase 5 of the MCU and a proper introduction to the new Big Bad: Kang the Conqueror. We've met a variant of Kang before in Loki, but He Who Remains was an appetiser (sorry for all the food metaphors, we must be hungry). Quantumania's Kang is the one who truly launches us into the Multiverse Saga, starting a non-stop journey to Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars. Ant-Man appears to finally be getting his due, being the first Avenger to battle the new Thanos-level baddie. And yet despite the worthy accolade, it ends up being a double-edged sword as Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania never really feels like it's about Ant-Man. Quantumania starts with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) effectively retired from the superhero life, unless it gets him a free coffee. As well as becoming a bestselling author, Scott's main aim is to improve his relationship with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) after too much time away. Unfortunately for Scott, Cassie has been exploring the Quantum Realm with her grandad Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and it soon has dire consequences for the entire family. Scott, Cassie, Hank, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) find themselves sucked back into the place they really don't want to be. In place of family bonding, Scott, Cassie and co find themselves facing a powerful new foe with links to Janet's Quantum Realm past: Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). Because who needs character development when you've got the future of the MCU to set up and trippy set pieces to deliver? The movie pays lip service to Scott trying to repair bonds with Cassie and make up for lost time, but this ends up playing second fiddle to the arrival of Kang. Kang is pivotal to the MCU in a way that Ant-Man still isn't, so Quantumania first spends a lot of time ominously teasing his arrival rather than focusing on the characters already established. It doesn't help that once we head into the Quantum Realm, Scott and Cassie are separated from the rest of their family. So we have dual missions, each with multiple new characters to meet for one scene or two, and Quantumania is overstuffed as a result with no element fully satisfying. Once Kang finally arrives, the movie improves significantly almost singlehandedly thanks to Jonathan Majors. We've seen a version of Kang before, but this Kang feels different instantly with Majors softly spoken, terrifying and utterly compelling with a charisma that convincingly sells why people would follow him. Unfortunately, the plot is thin and if you've seen the trailers, you've got the entire thing. In place of a deeper story, you get exposition dumps and foreboding teasers for the future which leaves Quantumania feeling like a Kang origin movie and not an Ant-Man trilogy closer. For some Marvel fans, that might be acceptable as the previous Ant-Man movies weren't universally beloved. However, they did at least feel different to other Marvel outings as they were ground-level romps, more concerned with making small things ridiculously big than world-ending stakes. Quantumania still holds some of that Ant-Man charm in flashes. One set piece in a probability storm takes full advantage of the trippy setting, while hilarious supporting characters Veb (David Dastmalchian) and Quaz (William Jackson Harper) are likely to be instant fan favourites. MODOK feels like a perfect fit as an Ant-Man villain too, quirky and a little bit pathetic. If you haven't had the reveal spoiled for you, we won't do so here, but it does lead to some pretty ropey VFX work in parts. The characters themselves respond to the look when MODOK is unmasked, but it doesn't negate that it looks bad. Talking of VFX, Quantumania is a very VFX-heavy movie, even by Marvel standards, as a result of it taking place almost entirely in the Quantum Realm. It gives the scope for a wide range of species with settings that are like the Marvel version of Mos Eisley Cantina. However, the landscapes blur into one and are often murky, especially during the big set pieces. It's a common Marvel criticism, but feels more like a missed opportunity here when the visual scope is literally endless as we're talking about a ""secret universe beneath our own"" with multiple worlds within worlds. Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania ends up as a movie with great elements, rather than completely satisfying whole. It has several fun gags, the requisite surprises for long-term MCU fans and in Jonathan Majors, an excellent new villain who you want to see more of. If you wanted Ant-Man to finally be the star of the MCU though, you won't find that here as his trilogy closer is all about Kang. Hopefully Quantumania is just the means to an end to establish Phase 5, rather than a sign of messy things still to come in this phase.  ©2024 Hearst UK is the trading name of the National Magazine Company Ltd, 30 Panton Street, Leicester Square, London, SW1Y 4AJ.

"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL," Technically, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the smallest Ant-Man movie, since almost all of it is set inside the infinitesimally tiny “Quantum Realm.” But only technically; from pretty much any other perspective, it’s the biggest film in the franchise. It embroils its shrinking superhero and his allies in a battle for the fate of the Quantum Realm, and maybe all life in the multiverse. If you enjoyed the earlier Ant-Mans for their relatively low stakes and charmingly mundane side characters, you may find yourself perplexed by Quantumania. How did we wind up here? Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is wondering the same thing. As his opening voiceover narration concedes, his life “doesn’t make sense.” It’s true; in just a few years, Scott went from a cat burglar robbing an eccentric scientist named Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to using Pym’s shrinking tech to travel through time and save half of all life in the universe with the help of Hank’s daughter Hope — AKA the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly). Things only get weirder in Quantumania, after Scott’s teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) sends a signal into the Quantum Ream, and the response unexpectedly sucks Scott, Cassie, Hank, Hope, and Hope’s mom (and Pym’s wife [and the original Wasp]) Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) down into its uncharted microscopic depths. From there, Quantumania becomes a non-stop barrage of action, visual effects, and occasional infodumps, mostly about the movie’s ominous but nebulous villain, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors). This time-traveling warlord has been trapped in the Quantum Realm for years, and now he wants out. And if you know anything about Marvel’s plans for the next five years — or even just the title of the next Avengers sequel — you know the dude means business. Kang talks a lot about time; he claims he can give more of it to some characters, and describes it to others as “a cage” that must be escaped. It certainly feels like a cage during Quantumania, which races breathlessly around the Quantum Realm as Scott and his family encounter quirky locals and then come into conflict with Majors’ Big Bad. What’s up on the screen is fine. There’s a lot of pleasantly bizarre character designs and some trippy imagery as Scott ventures deeper and deeper into Kang’s fortress. Rudd himself remains a sturdy, likable presence at the movie’s center, always ready to balance out the screenplay’s impulses toward ominous speeches about fate with a well-timed, underplayed quip. (The script was written by Rick and Morty veteran Jeff Loveness.) Majors strikes a very different chord as Kang — where Rudd goes small, he goes very big — but it works for this character, who does seem like a very credible (if somewhat vague) threat. The rest of the supporting cast more than pulls their weight, with Pfeiffer as the main standout in way more screentime than 2018’s Ant-Man and the Wasp afforded her. The performances are even more impressive given that Quantumania seems to have been shot almost entirely in a big green room with everything except the top-billed stars added in later by computers. That’s all the stuff that’s onscreen. It’s the stuff that’s not onscreen that becomes an issue. The first two Ant-Man movies occupied a unique place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe thanks to their low-level drama and deeply human characters, most of whom weren’t superheroes at all. Since Quantumania rarely leaves the Quantum Realm, it loses a lot of the humanity and relatability that made the earlier films so charming. Quantumania sorely misses Luis (Michael Peña) and the rest of Scott’s crew at the security company where he worked when he wasn’t off avenging crimes. Scott and Cassie also mention his ex-wife Maggie (Judy Greer), but she never appears onscreen. And one of the best supporting characters in either previous Ant-Man has his role in Quantumania reduced to a wordless cameo. As a result, your reaction to Quantumania will probably be determined by what you want out of the movie. If you want to see a lot of strange CGI visuals and the you’re interested in the groundwork of the next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you’ll likely walk out satisfied (if maybe a little confused about the specifics of Kang’s larger plan). If you want to see an Ant-Man movie like the previous two Ant-Man movies — with wry humor, simple stories, and inventive uses of Ant-Man’s shrinking powers — you’re as out of luck as Scott Lang after Kang drags him to the Quantum Realm. Unlike Scott Lang’s life, Marvel’s choices do make sense; audiences tend to come out in larger numbers to their films that tie closely to the MCU’s overarching narrative. With Quantumania, they’ve brought Ant-Man from the fringes of the action to its center. That will undoubtedly make it the most financially successful entry in the franchise. But that choice may not be to everyone’s taste. -While Marvel’s hallmark for 15 years has been its ability to carefully build a massive interconnected franchise from the ground up, there are recent signs that their grand plan might not be as solid as it once was. Quantumania has several elements that work perfectly fine on their own, but don’t quite line up with characters, choices, and even locations that have come before. -I think a lot of people are going to be left befuddled by Kang. Like Thanos, he is immensely powerful and intimidating. Unlike Thanos, his goals and motivations are oblique. If you don’t know his comic-book backstory — which can be quite confusing in and of itself — you may not get the full picture from Quantumania."

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,While it lacks the small scale and roster of beloved side characters&#44; the narrow focus on this family and the new villain keeps &#8220;Ant-Man and the Wasp&#58; Quantumania&#8221; from going out of control&#46; 
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," Ant-Man has been vital when it counts, despite the ongoing gag of him being lesser known than most of the other Avengers. He was the ace in the hole for Team Cap in Captain America: Civil War and his escape from the Quantum Realm in Avengers: Endgame opened the way for time travel and ultimately defeating Thanos. Despite his big impact in the overarching Marvel Cinematic Universe, his solo films have been fairly smaller, self-contained adventures. That all changes with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania which kicks off Phase 5 and paves the path for what’s to come in massive ways. And no, I’m not just taking about Giant-Man. The 31st film in the MCU takes some big swings and while not every hit is a homerun, Jonathan Majors conquers the film (and our hearts) as Marvel’s next big bad, Kang the Conqueror. Phase 4 was rather lackluster in its presentation on both an individual level and the bigger MCU picture if I’m being honest, but Quantumania delivers an entertaining first act of what’s to come and leaves fans with plenty to be excited about. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is happy just spending time with his family after missing out on so much time following being stuck in the Quantum Realm. His daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) is now 18 and all grown up, and despite his absence from a lot of her life, Scott’s previously rebellious attitude has fallen not so far from the tree. With the help of both Hank (Michael Douglas) and Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie has developed in secret a device that can send signals into the Quantum Realm. Despite her good intentions of just wanting to learn more about the mysterious place, the device ends up transporting Scott, Cassie, Hank, Janet, and Hope into the Quantum Realm, where Kang (Jonathan Majors) has been lying in wait and looking for his own means of escape. Phase 4 was all about introducing the concept of the multiverse into the MCU, and with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania we’re starting to move forward along the path it created. The most exciting and interesting aspect of the film is the introduction of Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquer. Loki briefly introduced us to a variant of him known as He Who Remains but now we get to see a little more of what makes him the MCU’s next big bad. Majors is an imposing presence and dominates every moment he is on screen. Kang carries a sinister bravado in the way he speaks and acts. He’s earned that confidence as a technologically advanced person from the future who has lived outside of time. When Scott warns him that he’s an Avenger, it doesn’t phase Kang one bit. He’s killed so many of them that they all sort of blend together he explains. The way in which Majors talks so matter-of-factly sends shivers down your spine. He speaks as if he’s already won and that there is nothing anyone can do to change that fact. Not only that but he has the power to back up his claims, throwing Ant-Man and others around as if they were inconsequential. It’s fitting that Kang the Conqueror would make his debut in an Ant-Man film because to him, everyone is just an ant waiting to be squashed under his boot. Outside of Kang, Quantumania does an average job at exploring the Quantum Realm. At times the film feels more like its from the mind of James Gunn with its wacky alien creatures. Some, like a talking blob who is self-conscious over the fact that he has no holes, are hilarious comic relief characters. Not all the humor lands, though. And given how high the stakes are this time around for Scott and his family, the Marvel Studios formula of forcing its style of humor into every film is growing more tiresome. It’s difficult to experience the full implications of Kang when characters are cracking jokes every other minute. The MCU doesn’t need to go full DCEU on the drama, but I believe there is room for a more serious tone. There is also a lot of setup and exposition in Quantumania. It’s the first film of a new phase so that is somewhat expected, but the monologuing can get a bit cumbersome. Much of the film is split between Scott and Cassie and then Hope, Hank, and Janet when they get separated after entering the Quantum Realm. There’s a lot of ground to cover and sometimes the film can move at an ant’s pace. Kang is handled marvelously but most of the other characters, Scott included, feel like they’re riding in the backseat. There’s also the introduction of M.O.D.O.K, a killing machine with an oversized head hunting Scott and Cassie in the Quantum Realm. The character is great and the liberties taken with the comics to incorporate him into the MCU are fitting, but the visual effects on his face should have used more work. I’m glad they kept the same visual style from the comics for the character, though. It just takes some getting used to. After a mediocre Phase 4, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania has me once again excited at the future prospects of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It doesn’t quite reach the lofty heights set by the Infinity Saga, but it sets the story on the right path forward. Jonathan Majors showcases that Kang will no doubt be a force to reckon with, and with the idea of there being multiple variants of him across the multiverse, I couldn’t be more excited about seeing him in the role. This is no doubt Kang’s multiverse, and we’re all just living in it. The 31st film in the MCU takes some big swings and while not every hit is a homerun, Jonathan Majors conquers the film (and our hearts) as Marvel’s next big bad, Kang the Conqueror. Phase 4 was rather lackluster in its presentation both on an individual level and the bigger MCU picture if I’m being honest, but Quantumania delivers an entertaining first act of what’s to come and leaves fans with plenty to be excited about."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE," Superhero movies have gone all in on “universe building” of late, that “Avatar” model that pushes the notion “If we show them strange, ‘new’ and wondrous places, they will come.” Trapped in the multi-verse mania that has been a hallmark of post-“Avengers” comic book adaptations, it finds an excuse to drag our loveable goof of a hero (Paul Rudd), his sidekick The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and entourage — Wasp mama (Michelle Pfeiffer), shrinking/expanding scientist (Michael Douglas) and Ant Man Scott Lang’s neglected, acting-out teen daughter (Kathryn Newton) — into “The Quantum Realm.” That’s a universe that exists on a subatomic level. But you just know they won’t be content to fight over submicroscopic stakes there. Somebody in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is going to toss that word “multiverse” out there as its become like product placement  in most Marvel and DC superhero movies. “The Quantum Realm” is full of odd creatures like horses with snail heads and sentient manta rays who provide friendly “Finding Nemo” transport wafting through a gloomy, cave-like landscape that looks like “Avatar” with a different color palette.  Yes, there’s a war on, with a vast array of folks ranging from talking blobs to “Cantina Band” alumni to warrior princesses taking sides and resisting “The Conqueror” (Jonathan Majors of “Lovecraft Country” and “The Last Black Man in San Francisco”). The “jokes” in this “Avatar with Ants and Jokes” are provided by Rudd’s lighthearted persona more than witty dialogue writing. He can make Scott’s first panicked reassurance to daughter Cassie when they figure out where they are amusing just with sputtering Dad-isms. There’s topical messaging about “There’s always room to grow” as a person (Ant-Man puns!), getting involved in defending others — “Just because it’s not happening to you doesn’t mean it’s not happening.” — and the idea that even the most evil among us redeemable. Toss in the most boring Marvel villain in ages and colorfully-animated or costumed (Katy M. O’Brian) but generic sci-fi action archetypes fighting over this wholly derivative world you’ve gone to the trouble of building.  “Ant-Man” franchise director Peyton Reed cut his teeth on a cheerleading comedy (“Bring it On”), a forgettable Jim Carrey high concept comedy (“Yes Man”) and failed rom-coms (“Down with Love,” “The Break-Up”). His real gift to this genre is tone — light and jovial, not as clever or funny as “Thor,” but cute. He makes the CGI effects trains run on time, gets a cameo or two in (Bill Murray, a returning Corey Stoll) and makes one of them amusing and milks a few sight gags for all that they’re worth.  His direction of the Jeff Loveness script borrows from “Star Wars” and “Avatar” and even “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” and rarely in subtle ways. The action beats are often straight up “The cavalry’s here” Western tropes, with this or that character getting her or his fight “moment,” and others just left on the periphery.  But Majors seems at a loss, as good actors often are (Oscar Isaac comes to mind) when it comes to finding one’s omnipotent supervillain footing. At least Josh Brolin had the excuse of being wholly animated, and given a few darkly-amusing lines.  Fans will find more in this than I did. But if you’re a filmgoer not craving “fan service” from this and every Marvel movie, it’s just a time-killer, fitfully amusing tedium. "
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE," The state of the Marvel Cinematic Union is...meh. Increasingly, the entries in the franchise spawned from Marvel Comics characters and storylines play more like episodes in the most expensive television series ever—released to theaters two hours at a time—rather than meaningful self-contained stories. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the launching pad for ""Phase Five"" of its continuing story, offers too much sensational spectacle, melodrama, and high-stakes sci-fi adventure ever to bore its audience, but its echoes of exhausted blockbuster tropes ring hollow. No spoilers here: just enough to assure you that Quantumania isn't a lost rock opera by The Who. Suffice it to say that the blended family of Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne (Paul Rudd and Evangline Lilly as Ant-Man and the Wasp), Hope's folks Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne (Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer), and Scott's now teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) find themselves sucked into the Quantum Realm, a subatomic universe of wonders, terrors, and infinite possibility. They must find their way home while contending with a new ""big bad"" in the fearsomely named Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors, suitably imperious and intimidating), setting up a conflict that will come to a head in Phase Six's Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (2025). If your eyes have glazed over by now, feel free to stop reading. This movie is not for you. Of course, it should come as no surprise that a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania should overflow with comic-book nonsense, but director Peyton Reed's two earlier Ant-Man entries made a stronger effort to remain accessibly entertaining to those who have never set foot in a comic book shop. Quantumania starts out as what appears to be the umpteenth post-CGI ripoff of 1966's Fantastic Voyage and like tales of scientists on phantasmagorical missions, but the plot swiftly turns into a shorthand Star Wars, with Kang as the evil, stentorian Sith lord backed by an army of Stormtroopers while rogues gather in colorful cantinas and rebels organize in scrappy camps. Screenwriter Jeff Loveness' themes are halfhearted (dad-redemption for absent-dad-ism, baddie redemption for being ""a dick"") and his dialogue sounds like it was written by ChatGPT (Kang on time: ""It's a cage, and it does everything it can to break you""). Look, I'm not going to say I didn't enjoy myself during Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. I did. This movie allows Michelle Pfeiffer to play Linda Hamilton, and its action sequences at times get to go to particularly wild places most blockbusters can't go, most notably when Scott encounters something called a ""probability storm."" Although it can be difficult to get one's bearings at times in the thick of an overpopulated CGI muddle, the kaiju scale and shrink-and-grow novelty of the Ant-Man films still offer plenty of visual wonder (Lewis Carroll, eat your heart out!), and speaking of scale, six sequences shot with IMAX tech—including the entire extended climax—go extra-big in the specially-formatted IMAX version of the film. If you're going to see this, try to see it in a real IMAX theater with a 75-foot-tall screen. In San Francisco, where the film is set, that means a trip to the AMC Metreon, which holds the second-tallest IMAX screen in the US. On balance, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania remains tons of fun for comics nerds and an easy pass for anyone else. It's more franchise extension than film, more thrill ride than satisfying story, but if that's what floats your boat for a night out of the house, I've got music to your ears: mid-credits and post-credits scenes. Personally, I was more interested in Scott Lang's reading at City Lights Bookstore from his memoir Look Out for the Little Guy! (also available in audiobook), but to each their own, right?"
