"Jul 4, 2015","A gritty contemporary reenvisioning of Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men' which fails because Graham's version of the George character is fairly despicable. Steinbeck's story works because it is a story of friendship through difficult circumstances, but here the difficulties are largely self inflicted and the relationship is one of usage. At times also the tone of the picture moves away from sympathetic to almost contempt",NEGATIVE
"Mar 13, 2015","Bit of bulk does come in handy.

Danny is a poor degenerate gambler who runs petty errands for a local gangster, but he also takes care of a special needs adult named Joseph.  Joseph is a big strong man that defends Danny with every morsel of his existence, and Danny pays him back by taking care of him.  When Danny gets too deep with the gangster, he has to enlist Joseph in underground fights.  Joseph does well, so intern, Danny does well.  Will Danny ever use the extra money from the fights to turn their lives around or will he burn all their dough on cocaine and hookers until they're both ruined?

David Blair, director of Mystics, Bert & Dickie, The Fattest Man in Britain, Tabloid, and The Brown Man, delivers Best Laid Plans.  The storyline for this picture was actually very good and reminded me a little of Danny the Dog.  The character development was very good and the entire film is very well written.  The acting was also better than I anticipated and the cast includes Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Maxine Peake, David O'Hara, Brad Moore, Peter Wright.

I randomly grabbed this movie off Netflix and decided to give it a viewing.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this film.  I was a fan of Stephen Graham from Boardwalk Empire and thought he was perfect in this movie.  Akinnuoye-Agbaje also did awesome playing the special adult.  Overall, this is a very nice addition to the genre and worth a viewing.

"Feb 15, 2013","The best laid plans of any mouse or any man, would be to avoid this ill-conceived heap of shit.  How any of these actors read this patchy idea and signed up to this half baked lump of steaming turd is anyone's guess.  Avoid at all costs.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 19, 2013",very strong movie. very touching story. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje at his best,POSITIVE
"Jan 17, 2013","This is great - the guy who played the man mountain Joseph was amazing, Stephen Graham was great as a scruffy chancer - the fight club esque nature of some of it is a bit daft , and it's an uncomfortable watch at times, but yeah wow this was great. British flick set in nottingham.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 23, 2012","Best Laid Plans (2012)
Seanâ(TM)s Rating: 6.5 out of 10

This film, directed by David Blair, was inspired by John Steinbeckâ(TM)s novel Of Mice and Men.  Blair has spent the majority of his career directing made for TV movies or TV series since 1990, although he directed another film called âBert and Dickieâ? in 2012 as well.  This was a film that really relied on the castsâ(TM) ability and the lead actors delivered magnificently.  The leads were Danny, played by Stephen Graham (Snatch, This is England) and Joseph, played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Congo, The Bourne Identity) with an always memorable supporting role from David Oâ(TM)Hara (Braveheart, The Departed) who plays Curtis. 
The film is about a down on his luck, drug addicted Danny, who is the care taker for a mentally disabled, Joseph.  Danny finds himself in debt with gangster, Curtis, due to his addictions.  This prompts Danny to utilize a special skill of his mentally disabled friend, Joseph, to pay off the ever-growing debt.  The film spirals out of control as Danny realizes his drug problems have put his friendâ(TM)s life in dire peril as he tries to find a way to help him out.
The music composition was nothing that stuck out in a negative or overly positive way performed by Robert Lane (The Damned United) who has done other work with director Blaine.  I enjoyed the camera movements and shot composition as Ali Asad (Rise of the Footsoldier) was Director of Photography.  Technically speaking, the film was spot on but the acting was the main characteristic that stood above the other elements.  I have always loved the acting of Stephen Graham and David Oâ(TM)Hara as both give memorable performances in nearly every film they are involved in.  If there was a weakness, it came with the story.  The screenplay was written by Chris Green who is starting his career as a screenwriter and it showed in this film.  The dialogue was mediocre and the overall plot seemed a bit clichÃ (C).  Also, there were overly gratuitous sex scenes that didnâ(TM)t seem to fit the story which I donâ(TM)t know if this falls on Greenâ(TM)s shoulders or Blaineâ(TM)s.   
Another Netflix streaming movie, I recommend giving it a view!  I would love to hear your opinions about it.  While watching this film; expect to see several sex scenes, a lot of fighting, drug use, and blood.

"Aug 2, 2012","Predictable, shit storyline and the talent of Graham and Akinnuoye-Agbaje are wasted.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 24, 2012","This is only loosely based upon ideas from Of Mice and Men so don't expect a gritty urban update of the story.  That said though, the film does work as a British drama about people lost in a world that they don't belong in.  I did initially think that Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje had perhaps taken his portrayal of a Lennie type character a bit too far but it does work once the story comes together as a whole.",NEUTRAL
"May 10, 2012","2.5*s. Plodding remake reworking of mark twains "" of mice and men"". Set in a modern English inner city. Decently acted but with no vigour or swerve, boxing scenes become repetitive and over done",NEGATIVE
"Apr 16, 2012","What a great little hidden gem.  Didn't know anything about this, and was really impressed.  Great actors, and great characters.  Stephen Graham was fantastic, as always.  Really would recommend this.  Always good to watch something you don't know anything about that turns out to be really good.",POSITIVE
"Mar 20, 2012","I wouldn't recommend this movie but it was  worth watching i suppose, but only just. Bad soundtrack though.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 16, 2012",ridiculously terrible,NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2012","This is a poor independent British film about a man who uses his mentally handicapped friend to fight, to pay off his debts. Stephen Graham (This Is England and Al Capone in Boardwalk Empire) is a lonely drunk down and out, paired up with Jospeh (played oddly by Oz and Lost star Agbaje), who he befriended in prison, in a twisted little fairy tale.

The film is slow, lacking in content and it's odd nature makes it an non entertaining, weak watch. The acting is ok but the idea is short and this makes for a shallow and hollow ending (and overall feel throughout). The fights are woeful (which will attract some viewers) and the film is more a TV drama than a movie. There are three relationships in the film, with it flicking between a grim fight story and two separate love tales of the two leads. Not much to recommend here.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2012","Really good! If you like an English Gangster style movie then this will do it for you. Great acting, good storyline, but not quite the ending I expected.

Having watched the trailer I got the impression the film would be dominated by just brutal cage fighting but in total the cage fighting time was perhaps no more than 5/6 minutes over the duration of the film and is integral to the anguish that Danny experiences in his relationship with Joseph as one short fight follows another. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje does a good job of tackling the potentially very sensitive part of a vulnerable and challenged adult with a mental age of a young child. The developing and changing relationship between Danny and his hooker girlfriend is a good supporting theme running alongside that of Danny and Joseph as also is Joseph's relationship with his girlfriend Isobel who is played with equal sensitivity by Maxine peak. David O as Curtis the gangster is really scary. As bit of a wrinkly now I hoped this was not going to be just the violent and shoot em up which was suggested by the trailer and it wasn't. Instead I saw a film that produced all kinds of emotions and the way the film concludes on the snowy coast of Ireland is brilliantly directed.

I think this is worth viewing!!
4.5 stars!!!! Didn't give 5 because I'd of liked a slightly different ending ;-/
A must see!",POSITIVE

"Feb 7, 2012","This used condom of frothy discharge fell way,way short of its predecessor 'Best laid Grans'. My displeasure was palpable as I sat in the premier seat of the picture house,with my cock in my hand, and a low budget gangster brit flick played out before my ebbing stiffy. Watch it if you want,I couldn't give a flying fuck.",NEGATIVE
