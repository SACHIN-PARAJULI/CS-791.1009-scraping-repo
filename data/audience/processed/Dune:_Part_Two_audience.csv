"Apr 13, 2024",Not as good as the first movie. The first was a good balance between “geo-political” realism and prophecy/ supernatural. The second is too heavy on the supernatural/ fantasy aspect that it gets a little weird. Also in the first it was so exciting to be introduced to this universe and different locations— while the second is almost entirely dull dessert scenes. ,NEUTRAL

"Apr 12, 2024","É interessante observar os detalhes qual foram desenvolvidos cada mundo de Duna parte 2 com seus efeitos, cores texturas, mas, infelizmente com um roteiro que deixou a desejar, em momentos apressado de mais deixando algumas parte da história sem contexto, em outras arrastado de mais deixando o telespectador um tanto entediado, talvez na espectativa de nos deixar com o desejo de quero mais. A espera da próxima fase desse universo intrigante, para sabermos o desfecho de uma grande guerra que aparentemente será travada. Aguardemos.",NEUTRAL

"Apr 12, 2024","This movie needs to be watched, and it needs to be watched only in IMAX.",POSITIVE
"Apr 12, 2024","Dennis does a fantastic job at painting Paul Atreides in the theme that Frank Herbert had originaly intended in his science fiction franchise.

Beautiful cinemetography, fantastic story telling, and great actions sequences.  I wish I had re-watched the original again prior to seeing this so I could really immerse myself into Arrakis; but the film is nonetheless a treat and easy to follow without that.

Incredible acting from everyone that is/was involved with this film.  Really hoping Dennis creates a trilogy out of this franchise.",POSITIVE
"Apr 12, 2024","Spellbinding, start to finish",POSITIVE
"Apr 12, 2024","Truly one of the most boring, clichéd and poorly put together movies of all time. I would say top ten worst movies, but quite honestly #1 worst movies with absurdly high ratings in the history of film. The reviews from both critics and the public are astounding, demonstrating the remarkable decline in human intelligence, even since such recent masterpieces as Avatar or any of dozens of sci-fi genre pieces of film art. Hours of desert, some of the worst acting—and casting—of all time. Timothea.. not even remotely believable as any kind of hero or warrior, temperamentally, physcially.. and with the charisma of a newt. His acting chops are simply non-existent, maybe the most lack lustre actor of his generation. Some good CGI here and there, but the whole dreary and somber portrayals of worlds and cultures are simply stereotypical, been there, done that. Well.. if you need something to put you to sleep, maybe. But even then, it is mainly annoying, and overall simply silly from start to finish. And not in an good ""made for kids"" way, but in an immature, inept way. These are facts. But hey.. apparently people ""love it"" so there goes civilization as we knew it.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 12, 2024","This is probably the greatest sci-fi movie I have ever been blessed to see. I came into this movie hearing the ""greatest movie ever"" comments from everybody and anybody on social media. While I was watching the movie I would often think ""is this what people think is the greatest movie ever?"" But when I finished the movie I thought to myself that these people might actually be right. So good I saw it a total of 3 times. Highly recommend!",POSITIVE
"Apr 12, 2024","In a time when audiences are fatigued from flavorless, CGI-heavy, cash-grabbing rehashes, Dune: Part Two spices up the industry with the quality of its craft. Everything from the writing, performances, costumes, cinematography, score, production design, and visual effects is a marvel to witness on the big screen. Those claiming it's the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings of their time fail to realize it's an average story in a simply well-made film given the proper budget and marketing, which was the norm for most films back when studios treated their movies seriously. Hopefully, more upcoming releases will receive the same support so that cinema can begin to heal from the degeneration caused by the MCU.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 12, 2024",One of the best films of my life.,POSITIVE
"Apr 12, 2024","A masterful adaptation that elevates the source material without straying away from the core message. This is a brilliant example of how easy it is for a charismatic leader to win us over.

Brilliant acting, brilliant sound, brilliant cinematography. Perfect!",POSITIVE

"Apr 12, 2024",Movies with such detailed stories are rare.,POSITIVE
"Apr 12, 2024","Amazing!.  This film made me want to go to the theaters for everything.  All the actors nailed it.  Zendaya was her usual self, and many others were actual Oscar worthy.",POSITIVE
"Apr 12, 2024","I don't know what all the hype is about. It is a good movie that entertains and let's the time pass fast. However, the battle scenes are not that impressive and neither are the worm sections. I expected more.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 12, 2024",Great story. A bit long but the cinematic shots  drives the drama.,POSITIVE
"Apr 12, 2024","Quien diría que tendría tantas diferencias en comparación al libro, y que funcionara de una manera mucho más orgánica, interesante e inmersiva.

Sorpresivamente, siendo éste un drama religioso, la hace sentirse más como un evento histórico que como un evento cinematográfico.

Si se hubiera estrenado en el 2023, Oppenheimer no hubiera tenido ninguna oportunidad en las premiaciones.",POSITIVE

"Apr 11, 2024","I love sci-fi. Unfortunately the Dune movies, and I watched them all are based on a book that was an indulgence of the author's need to write in long rambling story lines. After the first dune movie I thought possibly it was just a poorly made movie and then after watching the most recent two movies it's the story that is tedious and no amount of movie making can make the story interesting enough for nearly 5 hours of viewing time that is required for Dune one and two.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 11, 2024","The action scenes were great, and it was so imaginative, I can't wait for it to be released digitally so I can play it on repeat.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 11, 2024","How on earth does this rate so high? I love sci-fi. I read the Frank Herbert books. I watched the David Lynch version when it came out. And, played the video games such as Dune Emperor.
Dune 2 is tedious and self-indulgent. In an effort to create an epic film Villeneuve has made something that equates to watching sand blow across a desert. The production design is awesome. That's probably the best part of the film. And, what is it with these space people? Can't they afford to buy a light bulb? You know, like have a room or two lit? Is the only way to create atmosphere having the super rich worried about their next electricity bill and not turning anything on?",NEGATIVE

"Apr 11, 2024",It's maybe the best movie I've ever seen. A few differences from Herbert's original book however.,POSITIVE
"Apr 11, 2024",One of the best action/sci-fi movies.,POSITIVE
"Apr 11, 2024",Just wow. It lives up to all the hype and then surpasses it! I genuinely feel like this is a film that will be seen as revolutionary. Denis Villeneuve has created something that is epic beyond proportions. I believe this can justifiably be called a masterpiece and will be mandatory learning in film classes for generations to come.,POSITIVE
"Apr 11, 2024","Just Outstanding ! The first installment (Dune1) was very good. Dune 2 is everything an audience would want from a SciFi/Thriller. Plenty of Action, Great CGI, Dynamic Cast of Talented Actors and Actresses.",POSITIVE

"Apr 11, 2024",Really well made and great special fx. I dislike Chalamat though because he's a talentless pretty boy who spends more time in making faces in the mirror than actual acting.,NEUTRAL
"Apr 11, 2024",Truly one of the best movies I have seen in cinema and just in general truly life changing experience and I know a lot of people feel that way too. I'm a huge fan frank Herbert books and dune truly has changed my life that book is the reason I am still now reading books it really opened my mind to a completely different world and rung me in and Denis captured that feeling perfectly. The acting was literally out of this world I can for see Timothee getting that Oscar nomination as written!! 😂 But seriously towards the end of the movie we see where Denis blended pieces of dune messiah into part two and it was incredible to see Timothee truly transform into the person Paul was always inevitably going to become and be going forward. The cinematography was jaw droppingly stunning I felt like I was physically there on Arrakis with some of the shots Gregg was giving us. Like there's so much more I can say about this film but I'd literally be here all day. An absolute masterpiece in other words!!,POSITIVE
"Apr 11, 2024","I was not a fan of Dune before seeing this film. I remember the hype around the first film when it came out, but I was not interested in seeing it and was unfamiliar with the franchise. I understood through the buzz that the movie was sci-fi, long, well-received, and had Zendaya. I still have not seen the first movie yet. 

That was my background knowledge about the movie before my father asked me if I wanted to watch Dune: Part Two with the family. I was hesitant about going as I told him the movie was long and that I had yet to see the first part. He was surprised and slightly offended by that. My father is a nerd but does not show it as much as others. I did not expect him to be so passionate about it. I was also surprised to hear that he had watched the first part multiple times since it came to streaming services. 

I agreed to see Dune: Part Two, thinking it would be a good time with family. I expected to enjoy the movie generally and only get slightly bored during the film's run time. My father would be happy, and that would have been more than enough for me. I watch a recap of the first part in the morning; we leave for the theater and sit in our seats in time for the film to start. 

I was enraptured throughout every part of the film. There was no moment when I was bored or too distracted by other things. This was surprising, considering the theater experience was unpleasant when I went this time. Each scene was beautiful, and it felt as if every frame was uniquely put together. I remember very specific thinking that I wanted to scrape through the screencaps and study every one of them for their composition and color. The accompanying music track was immersive, making the already stunning visuals come to life.",POSITIVE
"Apr 11, 2024","The cinematography of this movie is absolutely astonishing. The cast and the acting is equally as superb, and the change of pace from the first film makes for a great experience for fans of Dune. Overall I would definitely recommend seeing this (especially in theaters)",POSITIVE

"Apr 10, 2024",Builds on part 1 perfectly.  Absolutely awesome in its scale.,POSITIVE
"Apr 10, 2024",Proceeds its world building first movie with the perfect follow up. The New characters may throw you off because of the big time actors that play them but they really outperform their roles. Music is used perfectly to heighten key moments and immerse you into each key moment. Especially in the theatre.,POSITIVE

"Apr 10, 2024","Why do people overrate whenever they some some decent visuals? The characters, the dialogs, the action, and storytelling are so incredibly childish that it is unbelievable that writers&director aren't actually 13 years old kids.

"Apr 10, 2024",Popped my pussy. 10/10,POSITIVE
"Apr 10, 2024","Denis Villeneuve has established himself as a modern director synonymous with the word ‘epic.'  With films like Arrival, Blade Runner 2049 and, of course, the first Dune from 2021, he knows how to make whatever he's directing feel huge, and so it is with Dune: Part 2, one of the few sequels I've actually been looking forward to in the last few years. The original film had a tough task of adapting an infamously complex story and mythology into a 2-and-a-half-hour movie, but it succeeded admirably. With Part 2, Villeneuve has gone the Empire Strikes Back route by pushing the story into much darker territories, and its all the better for it. There's a lot of things going on, several disparate plotlines that are destined to cross, and while we spend more time with some rather than others, it never feels like any of them are being forgotten or glossed over. With such a massive cast, big names like Christopher Walken & Florence Pugh get diminished screen time, but it never feels like they're turning in half-assed performances as a result. The one-on-one fight scenes are still cut a little erratically, but generally the action sequences are given scale and weight. You feel the pressure on our heroes as they battle a far larger and more powerful enemy, and I liked how the climactic battle came down to smart tactics and wise decision making, rather than just being another case of 2 big armies charging at each other and the winner being whoever has people left standing. Despite the undoubtedly grand scale, the film doesn't lose track of the human element, with Paul's romance with Chani, his contentious bond with his mother and his burgeoning alliance with the Fremen all given lots of screentime. Paul as a character goes through a lot in the course of the film, and by the end he's recognisably the same person, but moulded considerably by struggle and expectation. Austin Butler makes for a menacing, if underutilised villain who I would have liked to see more of. Hans Zimmer's score is suitably bombastic, but gets toned done or silenced when its appropriate. It's a film that practically begs to be seen on the big screen, and with a 3rd instalment already confirmed, it's difficult to see how they're going to top this one, but I'll be right there when they try.",POSITIVE
"Apr 10, 2024","Doesn't have an ending. The credits roll without anything really being resolved, so it's hugely disappointing to invest all this time in the characters only to be left on a cliffhanger ending wondering what's going to happen to them. If you can't make a movie with a complete plot and release it all at once, don't bother.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 10, 2024","Dune: Part 2 certainly shined in almost every aspect whether this is from the cinematography, visual effects, direction, tone, a well driven story or the strong performances from its cast.",POSITIVE

"Apr 10, 2024","The movie was amazing, the actors were so charming that made me can't take my eyes of the film, the cgi, the sounds this movie are by far one of the best i saw this last years, i willingly wait for the third part, love it.",POSITIVE
"Apr 10, 2024","This was as good if not better in the epic visual department, but for being longer than the first film, you'd expect more plot progression, and that didn't happen. Instead, we get mostly lame teeny-bopper high-school puppy-love melodramatics. It felt more like a Disney film meant for kids, not a mature enough sci-fi drama. I also wasn't a fan of Chalamet in the first film - he just wasn't convincing in appearance nor performance, and it's even worse in this film. Dude seriously needs to get rid of that mop on his head and start hitting the gym, his 11 year old frame isn't convincing as a towel boy, let alone a leader who easily wins battles to the death over guys at least double his size. First film was an 8, this is a generous 7, all going to the visuals and everyone else's performance except Chalamet's. Hopefully the writing and Chalamet's pubescent growth improves in the third and final film.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 10, 2024","This movie is so amazing! Denis Villeneuve adapts the previously unadaptable novel so perfectly. The visual effects and cinematography are top notch. Hans Zimmer creates one of his best scores. There were moments when I was grinning up at the IMAX screen. Austin Butler and Timothée Chalamet deliver amazing performances, but Rebecca Ferguson absolutely steals the show as Lady Jessica. She sells the role so well. Overall, this movie is a 5 out of 5 stars.",POSITIVE
"Apr 9, 2024",I cannot wait until the next one. I will have to rewatch all of them together once all have been released as a set.   The length pushes the need for intermission barrier. Seriously!!!  The length is fine but an intermission would have been welcome.,POSITIVE

""Dune Part 2: Disappointing Continuation of the Saga""

As a fervent fan of the original ""Dune"" novel, I approached ""Dune Part 2"" with great anticipation, only to find myself sorely disappointed. Frank Herbert's masterful universe seems to have lost its magic in this lackluster sequel.

One of the most glaring issues is the pacing. While the first book expertly balanced intricate world-building with gripping plot development, ""Dune Part 2"" drags on with tedious exposition and unnecessary tangents. The narrative feels bloated, weighed down by superfluous details that detract from the overall enjoyment.

Furthermore, the character development falls flat. In ""Dune,"" readers were treated to complex, multidimensional characters with motivations that resonated deeply. In contrast, the characters in ""Dune Part 2"" feel one-dimensional and uninspired, lacking the depth and complexity that made the original cast so compelling.

Additionally, the plot itself lacks the intrigue and suspense that made ""Dune"" such a gripping read. The stakes feel lower, the conflicts less engaging, and the resolutions predictable. It's as if Herbert ran out of creative steam, recycling tired tropes and clichés instead of pushing the boundaries of his own imagination.

Overall, ""Dune Part 2"" fails to live up to the lofty expectations set by its predecessor. While it may hold some appeal for die-hard fans eager to revisit the world of Arrakis, casual readers are likely to find themselves bored and underwhelmed by this lackluster continuation of the saga.

"Apr 9, 2024",I enjoyed it... but... slightly underwhelming.,NEUTRAL
"Apr 9, 2024",A huge step up from the already great Dune 1. The storyline and acting is amazing along with the visuals. There was not a part of the movie that i was bored watching. the only negative view i have on this movie is about how easily some of the villains were killed off especially Dave Bautista's role  (Glossu Rabban). But overall it's a great movie and probably the best one this year.,POSITIVE
"Apr 9, 2024","Sleepy … I literally was falling asleep and lost the plot. I liked part one enough I had just streamed at home to go see part two in theatre, but felt like a waste of time. If you want a more interesting messianic story try just reading the Bible, watching the Chosen tv series, or Matrix or Star Wars.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 9, 2024",Save your money and your time. Utter trash. The best thing going was the limited romance and that gets ruined by the ending. Won't be seeing part 3. People who think this is good must be the same people that look at a sloppy splatter painting and say it's Awesome!,NEGATIVE

"Apr 9, 2024","After watching, I had to watch some videos on YouTube to fill in some of the gaps and story.  You had to be aware of, what seemed like  small aspects in the first Dune, to fill in some blanks. Or you needed to read the book.  Some of the story just jumped here and there and it was really only after I watched these videos that I realised the main character actually isn't a nice person.  The bit at the end came a bit out of left field and I probably didn't need to have to read the book or find ""fill in the blanks"" videos to understand it.  Visually it was ok, lots of cgi. Some good visuals but it was just ok for me.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 9, 2024","Wow, great acting. Amazing cinematography! So much plot development and action. It was one good scene after another. I've watched this movie four times already at the theaters. The bar has been raised very high for the SciFi movie genre!",POSITIVE
"Apr 9, 2024",Flat acting. Close to two hours of desert shots not all of them interesting. Zendaya only had two modes the entire movie. The falling in love and being in love part was not at all believable. I guess I should blame the Director? The music and the sound was impressive but almost too much. Yes we know the story of Dune. That didn't make this movie any better. Was it better than the first? Perhaps.,NEGATIVE

"Apr 8, 2024","Still an unfilmable series of ever more complex  novels. Visually appealing though this one is - the latest iteration in a series of unsatisfactory attempts barely scratches the surface of Herbert's highly nuanced geopolitical ecoverse.

I put 5 stars because I did loved it and it has some things that are immutable from the original book, but in the movie they missed one thing, they almost didn't showed how much Paul suffered with everything that happened and I missed it a lot, but it stills one of the greatest pice of art (in my opinion).",POSITIVE
"Apr 7, 2024","Great. They nail it with the visuals which I like a lot from the first movie. Great character development. The action isnt over the top and mostly visually interesting. The conclusion, it plays out its own rules and not what most ppl expect. I appreciate this movie because it takes me out of reality into the Dune world. I'm familiar with trilogies, so trilogies are cool but this one isn't ground breaking, it's not like Star Wars please it's definitely not Star Wars",POSITIVE

"Apr 7, 2024","This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie. Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame. Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15.000 years of civilization. Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling, Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch. The pacing is irregular, at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed. Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material, you don't get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made. Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films, is probably not doing the story justice, should have been remade into an  tv series to make it really work, therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 7, 2024","Not knowing much about the story, it had a good feel and was enjoyable.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 7, 2024","Better than the first film, although I preferred the locations and how the first one was shot. 
It's still nowhere near as good for me as people are making out. Not a lot going on in the first half of the film. Very well made though, no one can argue with that.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 7, 2024",Damn near perfect. Should not have made the finale as close. Otherwise a great adaptation of difficult source material.,POSITIVE

"Apr 7, 2024","No flaws,  great movie in all aspects music, acting, score, photography...a masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Apr 7, 2024",Best movie I have ever seen! I have been reading and re-reading the Dune series for decades and this is finally the movie that captures the emotional power I feel when I read the books.,POSITIVE
"Apr 7, 2024","When I first saw the first DUNE, I thought to myself: ""wow this is such an amazing movie. From the VFX to the diolog, to everything. And I liked the idea of DUNE. It was like a more grounded version of star wars. But then came the second movie to the amazing franchise. It left me spechless and exited for the next movie( DUNE messiah) Timothee chalemate really nailed the part of Paul. As so for Rebeca fudgesson. I really enjoyed her in SILO, for a reason like in this movie. Her acting looks like the charecter from the books.  Denis Villenueve is a genius. I really recomened watching the movie in theaters. It's just a one time expiriens that you will never get again. Recomend the movie. 10000000000000000/ 10. Must watch.",POSITIVE
"Apr 7, 2024",Awesome. The best cinematic experience I've ever had.,POSITIVE
"Apr 7, 2024","Dune Part 2 - teen angst is better than the MCU, but not by much

First, the good parts - the movie theater was clean and the reclining chairs were comfortable. Parking was fine too. The guy from the 8th Air Force did a good job playing a psycho. All this just shows how low the bar is in the US movie industry these days. 

Now for the rest - the story was shallow and credibility was damaged by shark jumping inplausibility. What did the freemen eat? How did they build and repair anything? How does anyone ever dismount from a sandworm? Has there ever been a more incompetent military defense or intelligence network than that of the Sarduakar? 

Just none of it makes any sense and the suspension of disbelief isn't possible, especially when the emotional stakes are so low and the characters are mostly stereotypes. 

It was acclaimed and has a good rating on this site. I suspect part of this is selection bias and the rest is of that is a reflection of the expectations of the day.

Maybe go if you're a fan. Me? I'd like my 15 dollars and 2 hours 30 min back.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 7, 2024","I love Sci-Fi but this one was too long and too slow. I re-watched part 1 recently in order to enhance my experience of this second part, but it didn't help. On the contrary part 1 was much better (4 out of 5 stars).",NEGATIVE
"Apr 7, 2024","Visually, excellent. But I have serious doubts about the adaptation from the original. Some narrative lines had to be dropped, of course, but others were included unnecessarily. I guess the director had to make many hard choices (like the suspicion that Jessica was the traitor, not Yueh). About the characters themselves: I don't like the way Jessica and Stilgar were portrayed (the psycho mother and the zealot). I missed the last scene in the book, the exchange between Jessica and Chani was superb. I guess we'll have to wait for a third movie, many things depend on that eventual closing episode.",NEUTRAL

Dune: Part Two is a 2024 American epic science fiction film directed and produced by Denis Villeneuve 🍿 

It's good 🙂
I'd recommend it if you like this genre 👍🏼

Make sure you have the subtitles on, or you won't understand most of the movie…

Follow the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a path of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, Paul endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.",NEUTRAL

If you really want to see Dune what the original, everything is better and the customs are great as well as the dialog. I will keep this director in mind so I dont make the mistake of ever watching anything else he does. The acting bt Bardeen over the top, Muah deeb just ok and Chani not beleivable, it seem to me like they made this movie for money and not for the art.",NEGATIVE

The shots that showcase the scope of the story and the colors of every location look beautiful, even in the most dire and hostile of places. There's a lot of thought that went into every shot throughout the long runtime, which really doesn't feel like it drags at any point. The characters and dialogue are great, which compliments their placement in the celestial environments.

"Apr 5, 2024","A movie that is undeniably superior to its predecessor in every way, from visual effects to storytelling, Dune: Part Two is a Best Picture contender that deserves to win the whole damn thing.

The story was insanely hard-hitting, with twists and turns at every corner, which literally gave me a headache once the movie ended since there was so much to take in, truly. one of the most unpredictable stories in the history of cinema.

The writing was excellent as well - the writers don't get enough props on this movie. It is seriously one of the best cinematic pieces of writing of all time - if you guys ever watch this movie, you'll see what I mean.

The cinematography and the choreography combined were both amazing. The camerawork was able to catch every possible thing, along with some badass angles, and the fight choreography was beautiful. The fights felt insanely unpredictable as to who would win!

The cast performances were absolutely amazing. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, and Stellan Skarsgard were all immediate standouts since the first movie. I hated that the first movie didn't get any acting nominations at the Oscars, so this one had better get all the nominations to make up for it, haha!

Do not get me started on the visual effects. Dune 2 is insanely beautiful - especially considering the fact that this movie was made on a budget twice as small as Avatar 2's budget! The world of Arrakis is insanely beautiful.

Hans Zimmer absolutely killed it with the musical score as well! Hans is one of the greatest movie composers of all time, and this movie just adds another stone to his crown.

Denis Villeneuve's direction in this movie was absolute perfection. I'd go as far as to say that Denis is the sci-fi genre's Martin Scorsese. That's just my opinion, though, to be brutally honest.

The pacing in this movie was also WAYYYYYY better than the first movie. The first movie dragged so long in the first half to pick up insanely quick in the second, but this movie cut straight to the chase, and I love that!

Dune: Part Two is a perfect payoff to Part One, while also standing as a perfect setup to Dune: Messiah which entered development today (April 4th, 2024), sporting compelling performances, stunning visuals, impeccable writing, and stellar direction, cinematography, and choreography, cementing Dune's legacy as one of the greatest sci-fi media franchises, and this movie alone standing at the top of the mountain as the greatest epic sci-fi movie of the 2020s.",POSITIVE
"Apr 4, 2024",This was a thrilling movie and can't wait to watch it again. The sound can be a little louder but other than that it's great.,POSITIVE
"Apr 4, 2024","Visual AMAZING! But falls short otherwise.

The movie is absolutely stunning to see. Almost every shot could be framed & put on a wall without anyone thinking twice.

Sadly, that can only do so much. The story is thin, the acting is meh & even the action scenes are underwhelming. Which is the biggest sin next to the run time. So much potential was there but none of it pays off. 

Basically, this is an overly expensive coffee table book.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 4, 2024","This is the best movie I've ever watched in Cinema, 3 times IMAX, this is why we go to cinema. Thank you Denis Villeneuve for living. You are a game changer!",POSITIVE
"Apr 4, 2024","Again, gorgeous cinematography—worm-riding scenes are breathtaking. Satisfying plot progression. 
Recommend ignoring the kind of just silly romance scenes. they add very little and tarnish otherwise solid performances. Didnt need to be as long as it is. 
Still very entertaining overall.",NEUTRAL

"Apr 4, 2024","Close to the book, good pacing of the movie, good special effects, great on the big screen.",POSITIVE
"Apr 4, 2024","It's a boring 3 hour trailer for Dune Part 3. Skip the movie, watch a few of its trailers and wait for part 3 OR skip Dune 2, 3 etc etc and watch something better, shouldn't be hard to find a better movie!!!",NEGATIVE

I hope the director will finish his trilogy and continue on. I would love to see how he portrays the rest of the books.",POSITIVE
"Apr 4, 2024","Without being cliche but this is really the best movie I have ever seen, and I was there for Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and also for The Two Towers and Return of the King. In my opinion this blows them all out of the water, not just because of the amazing visuals, but those are truly amazing because Denis insisted on doing everything as practical as possible. Even the sandworm seems like you could really go ride one! But, it is the way it handles the ""chosen one"" trope. I have seen it 7 times in the theater, all in IMAX or Dolby and I really recommend not  missing this one in the theater. Just like those other epic films, it will be around and discussed forever. I am glad if the third movie is made, it will not have Return of the.... in the title!",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","Wow, such a great freaking movie! This is 1 film you should check out at an AMC Dolby theater because it's built for it. The visuals and sounds are jaw dropping and the action is top tier. While watching Paul's journey, I couldn't help but compare him to Anakin Skywalker's dive to the dark side. I can't believe Spring is the new summer movie season smh! Awesome flick!",POSITIVE

"Apr 3, 2024","Dune Part: 2 was my most anticipated movie of the year and did not disappoint. It's the best movie I have seen this year by far. I dare say it was almost perfect. Okay, maybe not perfect, but it was crazy good, to say the least. My favorite aspect of the movie was the world-building and deep lore segments. The first movie left me with so many questions. But this sequel genuinely feels like they answered many of them. Don't get me wrong, I still have plenty more. Yet I feel satisfied as a viewer for the new information we got. But mainly, I'm excited to learn more.

To get movie-specific Dune: Part Two feels more like a coming-out party for Paul. As the main protagonist or antagonist depending on who you ask Paul's rise was epic. It felt like he couldn't miss in this movie and Stilgar was there to remind the whole movie. Seeing Paul rise to the occasion again and again did have me hyped I can't lie.

The movie has a hero's journey-type vibe with a little ""chosen one"" energy sprinkled on top. Yet you can tell that the plot is a lot deeper than Paul's storyline alone. Matter of fact you can tell it's a lot deeper than these first two movies. I loved how fluent the cast rotation was for this movie. For the most part, they did a great job establishing new characters as we lose old ones. It makes the movie feel more alive.

One thing that I didn't like about this movie was the big battles or war portions of the movie. It felt way too one-sided and seems to be a continued trend from the first film. The issue is that it makes all the preparations and conversations pointless. Granted, I don't get tired of seeing the Freman pop up out of the ground ready to rumble. I wish there was some real pushback from the opposing sides. I don't care how much prep time they have.

Let's switch up the pace a little bit. I want to talk a little about the love interests. Something we were robbed of in the first movie. They killed it this go around. The newfound triangle between Paul, Chani, and Princess Irulan is going to be one for the ages. The reason is that we spent most of the movie seeing Paul and Chani boo love. While Princess Irulan was playing politics. Things are bound to get tricky with Paul's newfound position. Plus his political union with the princess. Paul is playing a dangerous game if you ask me.

Zendaya's portrayal of Chani was great. She not only grounded the movie but also stuck to her convictions regardless of what Paul had going on. This will set up some interesting conflicts in the future. Paul is going to have to make some tough decisions that are not so black-and-white. I just hope Chani will be around to help make them. 

The future looks bright for Dune. Learning about the empire and their roles in the prophecy was poetic. Plus with talks of a holy war things are going to get interesting fast. I am excited to see what Paul can come up with to keep the power he never really wanted. But this movie in general was really good. They made it feel like one big puzzle where you don't know what the image is going to be until the end. It feels like there's still so much to discover which is why I gave it a 9/10 G-Files score.

Seeing Paul becoming one with the desert is one thing. But seeing him gain the trust of the people is a whole other thing. Timothée Chalamet's speech was incredible. This movie takes the necessary steps to fully flush out its characters good or bad. You expect to see Paul embrace the title of Muad'Dib. His pursuit of revenge, vengeance, or freedom from the powers at be. It makes sense. You don't expect to be thrown into this chasm of politics, secret agendas, and visions of people not even born yet. This movie was amazing and I can't wait for the next one to come out.",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","Absolute movie peak. I loved every second of this movie, the only problem is that if you havent read the books the end is very hard to understand plus youll have to wait many years for the continuing.",POSITIVE

So for the second watch I went to an IMAX theater so that I could just enjoy it and I did. This movie is absolutely incredible. The cinematography is one of the best of all movies I'v seen. You feel like you're there on Arrakis, the characters feel real, their emotions feel real. The music is just incredibly cinematic. The visual effects are stunning. The sandworm-riding was the best part of the movie, it always looked more gorgeous each time we saw it. I cannot say the pacing is perfect, but it's certainly very good. During the first time watch I felt a little bored in the beginning.

The characters are all very interesting, my favourite being Stilgar of course, who probably deliveres all the jokes of the film. Javier Bardem is just amazing, but the best acting pefromance was given by Austin Butler. He was so intense. Timotheé Chalamet was also really good. these two are probably going to be nominated for a lot of awards. But everyone was great, I especially love Stellan Skarsgard's Vladimir Harkonnen.

All in all this movie is absolutely incredible, it's no question that it's a 10/10. Years later, when people look back on 2024, this film will probably come to their mind.",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2024",The  movie was epic. Every scene felt like it had been built upon.  Take the time to read the books and I think you will have a deeper understanding of the story and it be even larger than what you see on screen.,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","Masterpiece of cinematography again by Denis. The score is - as usual with Hans Zimmer - incredible, and gives the film such a unique, special feel. Can't wait for Dune Messiah!",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","It's a super well made movie with a lot of money.
One star is because it is not original at all. 

First of all, It's yet another adaptation of a story that's already been told.
Then, It's a mix of multiple films: Matrix (""he is the one...""), Avatar (the last test to become a Fremen, Paul jumps on a Worm, while Jake on a bird), The Gladiator (I don't even have to explain this .. ).. etc. 

I am a lover of original ideas and I hope that tons of money can be spend on new stories. 
A lot of people are creating/writing new stories. 
Give them a shot.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2024",Its a dry and horrible attempt at an Oscar Haul. Attempting to match the succes LOTR got but failing horribly. A storyline that was attempted to be saved by throwing big name actors at us... Overall this is one of the most overrated movies of 2024,NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","Perfect, I loved every single thing in this movie.",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","I would personally like to say that in 2024 this is movie of the year. I don't know what other movie can top this movie aside from planet of the eighth, but other than that this was a joy to watch but to let people know that this is definitely a sequel. There are some parts that you might be confused on so if you have not watched part one, please do before going into this, now this picks up right where it left off like five minutes ago where in the first dune Paul is traveling with the Freeman alongside her mother, and they are trying to apprehend the Harkenns. Throughout this movie, you can see a transformation in Paul in the downfall of Paul at the same time he is trying to lead the Freman to Paradise, but he keeps seeing visions if he tries or even attempts to lead them to paradise the performances in this movie is really good and the first one  I thought Timothy Chalamet was kind of a little weak but in this, he has a lot to work with and it's done very well. I have not read the book so I am confused on Florence Pugh character but other than that I was in with the story just like the first one every performance is really good, especially Javier Bardem, and Austin Butler, who really steals the show this is a visual masterpiece. Every single shot is so well done keep having these change of color pallets and it don't feel like a green screen or nothing and feels like you're into this world. Zendaya was pretty cool and really fits the character. Well sometimes I'd be questioning her acting but it's OK because in this she was really good, and this is actually a deeper dive into its theme and it's theme of religion. Is religion a manipulative tool or is religion the right way to go that's how I viewed the movie on its theme. Javier Bardem and represents the manipulative tool and Zendaya is the opposite and the final battle between Austin Butler's character and Timothée Chalamet character was so intense, and to be honest, I didn't know which one to root forwork, for, i was trying to rule for Timothée Chalamet‘s character, but I realize that he is now mixed in and following the visions that he don't want to follow in Austin Butler's character was so entertaining to watch that I really want to see more of him but overall this was a fantastic movie and tell me that they're going to kill Timothée Chalamet‘s character in part three because I want to see some real good consequences since these visions are now explored and well executed and in my humble opinion, this is my movie year 9.5/10",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2024",Absolutely epic! A masterpiece of cinema.,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","Awesome visual effects and cinemaphotography. Too bad that 10,000 years into the future all they have developed technologically is Roman Empire weaponry and 1960s gun technology. That required a little effort at belief. But it kept moving and was well done. The story is cute. Well-paced too. Obviously, there's a Dune: Part Three.",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","For a 3 hour long movie, a lot of it felt rushed. Except for Paul, the character development for many characters felt like it either came out of no where or there was no development of their character at all. The first part of the movie was a lot of feet dragging, but by the time they get to the actual conflict of the movie it feels like the movie version of a run on sentence.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2024",Great follow up to the first flick!! Seen it twice already!!,POSITIVE

"Apr 2, 2024",Really fun movie with lots of action. New content from the previous versions which I enjoyed and I am very excited that it left it as a cliffhanger for a future movie or two.,POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","Still incredible the second time. I was on the edge of my seat again at the end. Still amazed at how well the movie was done. Great cast, score and visuals. Stunning movie!",POSITIVE

"Apr 2, 2024","I enjoyed it very much, more than the first part.  Good script, good acting, good directing.",POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024",Not happy with all the filming,POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","""Dune 2"" is an exceptional cinematic achievement that seamlessly blends stellar performances, intricate costume design, and a captivating musical score. The cast delivers impeccable portrayals of their characters, enhancing the depth and authenticity of the narrative.

One of the film's standout features is its immersive exploration of diverse planetary landscapes, each meticulously crafted to reflect its unique culture and aesthetic. I particularly appreciated how each community showcased its distinct traditions and costumes, adding layers of depth and authenticity to the world-building.

The fight sequences are masterfully choreographed, showcasing both visual prowess and emotional resonance. Admirably, ""Dune 2"" remains faithful to the source material, incorporating rich lore from Frank Herbert's seminal novels while also offering fresh interpretations and surprises for fans and newcomers alike.

In summary, ""Dune 2"" is a cinematic tour de force that excels in both style and substance, offering audiences a compelling and unforgettable journey into the vast and intricate universe of Dune.",POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","Too Long 
Good Entertainment 
Whats that thing in their nose ?",NEGATIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","Wow! Mind blown! This is a perfect sci-fi film. It fulfills the first movie and what it set up faithfully. But this story can also stand on his own as we see Paul adapt the ways of the Fermen and signals signs of a prophet which he is. The big action in this film is so satisfying thanks to the rather slow and at times meticulous setup. The cinematography and sound in this film is groundbreaking. This is truly a film to experience. Wow, Dune 3 better be good. Amazing!",POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","This is a story very focused on violence and evil.  While admirable on film-making and technical levels, I would not recommend it for children.  The movie plot-line would be tough to follow if you are not familiar with the Frank Herbert books and/or had not seen the part one movie.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","To me, Part 2 was not even in the same league as Part 1. If not for having gone to see it with friends, I would have been perfectly fine walking out halfway, streaming it and fast forwarding to see the key moments. To me, it was not nearly as visually interesting. It was so devoid of the depth of character and relationship nuance explored in the Part 1. The complex (and possibly unhealthy) relationship between Paul and his mother that was so central in Part 1 is totally absent in Part 2. They hardly share any screen time together. Paul's ascension isn't believable, to me, nor is his change later in the movie. For me, there are other issues as well. Overall, this was hugely disappointing.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 2, 2024",Brilliant in every way,POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","Opera mastodontica, che si eleva soprattutto quando a farla da padrone sono gli effetti scenici e le immagini spettacolari.
La scelta di dividere la trama per motivi di business a tratti continua a sentirsi così come era stato nella prima parte, i dialoghi sono talvolta troppo rallentati e senza particolari velleità.
L'argomento simil religioso a tratti rischia di diventare prevedibile e stopposo, in parte il problema viene rimandato a quello che sarà il prossimo capitolo.
Ottime le prove attoriali e spettacolari le sequenze finali seppure la battaglia risulta essere davvero troppo veloce rispetto alle premesse.
Nota di merito per Austin Butler, personaggio assolutamente troppo poco sviluppato.",POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","Somehow, Denis Villenueve managed to make a film that just might have outdone its predecessor.  Dune: Part 2 goes heavy into the action, yet doesn't take anything away from to world building & plot progression. We learn so much about the characters, their world & the galaxy around them. My only hope is that they do in fact continue this story in further films. If not, these 2 films will no doubt still stand among the best SciFi epics of All-Time. I just want to thank everyone involved in the making of these extraordinary works of art.",POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","The first one wasn't horrible but this one was awful. NOTHING HAPPENED for most of the movie. Lots of sand and beige, BORING. How in the world does it get an above 90% rating. There wasn't much else to see at the time. I will not bother with the next movie in the series.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","Loved all the action, the acting was great .I had read the series when I was a teenager and loved it.The movie brought it to life.",POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","I went to see this movie expecting to be bored to sleep, however I was so wrong. The movie was epic in scale and visually stunning. The actors and writers did a great job recreating the world of Dune from the novels",NEUTRAL
"Apr 2, 2024","It's was extremely splendid, and I was tipping off the edge of my seat. You may be wondering why this extraordinary movie has been robbed of half a star. The reasoning behind this is the tragic death of sexy bald man. Would have loved for him to have more screen time.",POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024",Absolutely amazing. Truly the Empire Strikes Back of its day.,POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","I've just rewatched it, many times we use the word ""Masterpiece"" to describe a film that has been really good, at least for us, but it's safe and a must to say that Dune Part 2 truly is a MASTERPIECE. From the striking and touching soundtrack to the gorgeous scale of the shots and sequences. Denis Villeneuve truly delivered us a cult classic and a film that will be remembered of what cinema must be , enjoyable from start to end, time just flies through the desert, it is so beautiful when the sun is low.",POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024",Wanted to see all the hype about this movie so I watched Dune 1 on HBO Max was pretty boring but figured it was setting up the story then watched Dune 2 and wow I’m so speechless and amazed this movie was fucking amazing my god LONE LIVE THE FIGHTERS LISAN AL GAIB!!!!,POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024",Looks visuallty great.. has a great cast. but the film is dull and shallow. The story just didn't make me care about anything other than the relationship between Chani & Paul Atreides. I was happy when it all ended because the i was just so bored,NEGATIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","This films visually stunning. If you love Star Wars, youll recognize many shots are straight of that film. As for the story, meh. I walked out after the second hour. Ill watch the rest when its released to streaming. The character development is flat so youre not pulled into any of the storylines. This is just a movie to watch for the beautiful shots and intense music. But, after two hours of the same close up and thun thun music followed by another extreme close up and thun thun music, youre ready to go home. Dune 1 was better. Like this review, where Im struggling to find more to talk about than the pretty shots and music, the movie is too long two hours too long.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","Just finished watching the flick. Let me start by saying that the acting, as a general rule, was strong. There was one or two scenes which were almost a bit “childish,” but this may have been on purpose. Otherwise, amazing flick. Loved the subtle changes made to the source material which made the story better suited for the big screen. The special effects were first notch. Visually stunning movie. Can’t wait for part 3. ",POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","Dune Part Two is a masterpiece. It fixes almost every possible complaint from the first movie. It was well written and paced, with amazing acting and chemistry between characters. Very impressive on-screen visuals and amazing cinematography.",POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024",Absolutely wonderful movie. Amazing cast and great story.,POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","An epic sequel to Denis Villeneuve's 2021 'Dune'. Although it has quite a different feel from the first, it still delivers an amazing story following Timothee Chalamet's 'Paul Atreides'. Of course the Sci-fi drama wouldn't exist without mastermind author Frank Herbert. The 'Harkonnens' continue to portray some of the most treacherous villains in modern cinema, lead by star Austin Butler. Also, a wonderful score by Hans Zimmer, including 'Worm Ride'. A third film is all but confirmed, and although it will be difficult, if pulled off correctly will please fans and wrap up the Dune trilogy perfectly.",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","MAY THY KNIFE CHIP AND SHATTER! ABSOLUTLEY EPIC! MUST WATCH! TIMOTHEE CHALAMET DELIVERED THE MOST INCREDIBLE, CAPTIVATING PERFORMANCE! AUSTIN BUTLER ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED THE ROLE OF FEYD RAUTHA! SO GOOD!",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","The acting was incredible. The storyline picked up directly where it left off. I think the emperor and his daughters needed to be introduced physically, in the first movie.  I wish for more explanations of events.  Details as to WHY there were certain alliances guess I need to watch both movies, again. I must have missed something.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 1, 2024","DUNE MEETS STAR WARS, LORD OF THE RINGS, AND ROAD WARRIOR.  VISUALLY STUNNING AT TIMES, BUT MORE SPACE OPERA.  I SEE DUNE 3 IS ALREADY TRENDING",NEUTRAL
"Apr 1, 2024","Better than the first one, which means a lot!!",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","One of the best movies I have watched, 10/10 would recommend",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","Long, hard to follow, and honestly a bit boring for me. Sure it was cinematically impressive, but ultimately not for me. If, like me, you're not into the fantasy-heavy sci-fi genre about royalty and prophecy and all that stuff, I recommend not wasting your time.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 1, 2024",Best sci-fi movie over the last 50 years,POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","My new personality just dropped, I just might be Paul Maudib Atreides, Duke of Arrakis. Great camerawork, amazing CGI, refreshingly interesting story, and Timothee Chalamet",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024",The first movie I've ever gone back to see again in theatre. Must see.,POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","A truly stunning masterpiece. I watched this movie on the big screen just today and left with a new perspective on modern cinematography and Sci-Fi. The VFX and lighting were phenomenal, ranking at some of the best I've ever seen. The costume designs were fabulous and thoroughly enhanced the futuristic glamour of the movie. The pacing was well kept, while the storyline was interesting and easy to follow yet intricate and in-depth. This, in my opinion, far exceeded the quality of the original modern adaptation of the 1984 Dune. Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler are due well deserved praise for their contribution to making this movie a masterpiece, along side Zendaya and the entire cast. Thank you, Denis Villeneuve for making this movie truly shine among some of the greatest motion pictures in history.",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","The best science-fiction movie since original Star Wars...
We are back to old school mature movie like Alien. It's like a Game of Throne in space.

The movie is not perfect, but we are very close. I feel the imperfect is mostly from the book himself or Denis Villeneuve feel thats irrelevant to explain those details. Like I'm questioning how Fremen got their plastic tube and technologies inside a desert? Why Harkonnen use swords instead of Machine gun when they land?

We can debate about it but at the end what make that movie so good. Its the directing, the acting, the design, the editing, the music, etc... Everything is there.",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024",Thoroughly enjoyable.  Amazing cast so well acted. And the sets- both real and digital magic. A great ride - can't wait for Dune 3!!,POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","Great sequel... Epic, like LOTR, Harry Potter and Star Wars.  A lot of characters and story lines.  I went with my girlfriend who is NOT into sci-fi...but ,she totally got attached to the characters, mainly the love story.  I can't wait for Dune Part 3!",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","I grew up watching the theatrical and ""Alan Smithee"" cut of the 84 on Sci Fi.  Was really excited to see 2 and enjoyed 1 after a few viewings to get used to it being a completely different thing from the 84 version.  After probably 3 viewings I really liked the first one of these.  Saw 2 yesterday in a real IMAX theater and as someone who always plays stuff loud (music or home streaming) I actually thought this one was too much.  As someone else mentioned the protagonists are great, actually all the characters are, but there are too many and the screen time they receive is uneven.  Definitely not enough Paul.  I kept waiting for the movie to hit its stride and it never seemed to happen.
I may need to see this one a few more times to appreciate it more but I wouldn't say making it to an IMAX is a must.  I might have enjoyed this more in a smaller theater.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 1, 2024","It was an average movie with good action scenes and character growth and here is my full run through:
Austin Butler's character for the limited screen time brought a lot of drama and tension towards the movie though it took time to introduce him
Both Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson were great acting and had the best growth
Movie was too long and dragged at certain points
Overloaded with Characters so that actors including: Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Josh Brolin, Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux were wasted
Javier Bardem brought great humour towards the movie although at time was not appropriate for certain scenes",NEGATIVE

"Apr 1, 2024",Didn't like it. Too convoluted for me and way too long. I lost interest and still had 2 hours to go.,NEGATIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","Enjoyed it, but the sound was so loud in the IMAX theater that my iPhone warned about damage to hearing and showed a graph with 90-100 decibels. It was hard to understand the dialogue at times. Great cast. Loved the Hans Zimmer soundtrack. The sandworms were excellent.",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024",Saw it in theaters 2x,POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","It's a masterpiece in every sense. I've watched it twice already, and the soundtrack still gives me goosebumps in my headphones. I can't imagine how it can be surpassed in a third movie, but I'm looking forward to it.",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024",Made for the cinema experience.,POSITIVE

"Apr 1, 2024","Dune Part 2 surpasses all expectations, delivering an absolutely incredible sci-fi cinematic experience. From breathtaking CGI to stellar performances, the star-studded cast shines, elevating the film to new heights. Seamlessly continuing the narrative from its predecessor, Part 2 exceeds the already high bar set by the first movie. Each scene brims with passion and emotion, drawing viewers deeper into the characters' struggles and triumphs. The expanding lore of the Dune universe, from the intricacies of the sand people to the enigmatic Bene Gesserit and the menacing Harkonnens, captivates and leaves audiences yearning for more. As the plot unfolds, setting the stage for the next installment, anticipation for the future of the franchise reaches a fever pitch.

The characters were the driving force behind the story telling and not just there to be ornaments on a tale of DEI and CGI.  These characters make sense.

Possibly the best sequel ever made. It leaves you begging for more. It is going to be very hard for any film this year to even match its greatness. This deserves multiple Oscars including best picture. It had me in tears by the end. I e seen this several times already. It's filmed in IMAX and I highly recommend seeing this in IMAX.",POSITIVE

"Mar 31, 2024","I really enjoyed this movie.  I saw Dune Part 1 several years ago when it first came out, and recently re-watched it to refresh my memory.  I'm glad I did, having the refreshed memory of Part 1, made Dune Part 2 so much more enjoyable.  I'm looking forward to Part 3, just don't take three years for the next installment.",POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024",...I'm quenching for part 3,POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024","Awesome show. Everything I expected and more. Great graphics sound acting. Helps to have a background and understand what is going on. Some in our group were a little lost, but all enjoyed it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024",Está larga pero si está mejor que la primera tiene más acción y está entretenida me encantaría ver una 3ra parte,POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024",Hard to leave reviews sometimes but when you truly enjoy something it fills you with excitement and joy. This movie has been by far one of the bestest for 2024. This is after watching Dune part one and giving it another try to finish it. Amazing movie as well and the following of part two just mind blowing!! It's truly a movie well put together. An experience to have you at the edge of your seat!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024",L calidad efectos e historia es lo mejor que hay,POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024","This film is simply perfect, there are no words that can define how good this film is, undefeatedly deserving of the 2025 Oscar and all the awards it participates in.",POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024",Love it and must watch at the theater to get the sound effects.  Love the actors and the amazing effects.,POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024","Movie was good, but wrap it up already  if part three leads to a part four, Ill be waiting for it to stream.",POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024","The cinematography and CGI were fantastic, the sound was very good also. The story however is a poor adaptation of the book, with changes in characters and timeline which leaves it confused for anyone who has read the book.

Without giving any spoilers, but when you realise the last 20 minutes of the movie is about actually preparing the way for a sequel rather than bringing a proper conclusion to the story, it left me very disappointed.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 31, 2024","An amazing conclusion to part one, massive, epic, the ever expanding cast with A listers is just the cherry on top. The cinematography on this movie is out of this world - No pun intended, lol.",POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024","I had high hopes going into Dune 2, considering I enjoyed the first movie very much. The trailers and the TV spots all seemed very convincing and I'm glad my expectations were high because this film delivered on every possible level!

First off, I should definitely mention the characters that made up the film. All of the cast did a phenomenal job, including Timothée Chalamet, and Austin Butler, who were show stealers, and I think were some of the best performances of the year. And overall the entire cast really brought the story to life and their expressions and emotions, and the way they actually made you feel connected and brought into the story that they were telling.

And the story itself across the entire film was phenomenal. I hear a lot of people say that the last film didn't have enough action in it or it was just a little too slow and not enough sequences of violence or action or whatever. And I feel like that first film does a great job of setting up this film like it's a two-part series and the first film just setting it up while the second film will do all the heavy blows and it truly does that across the film. I especially feel that seeing more of the Fremen throughout the entire film was very cool to see, especially seeing how many of them there were, their customs, and how they slowly started to trust Paul as the Lisan Al Gaib. I really enjoyed seeing Paul's arc as he slowly starts to embrace his role as Lisan Al Gaib and seeing him slowly start to turn towards a darker path in his role as the Lisan Al Gaib. The twist with House of Attreides coming from the Harkenens was really cool and interesting to see. Especially towards the end, when Paul takes the life of the Baron(his grandfather), which was incredible to witness. Even witnessing what all happens on the Harkenen home-world was incredible. Especially seeing Feyd-Rautha murder the final members (to be thought) of house Attreides was breathtaking and how ruthless and violent he truly is. Even how he messed around with Raban(portrayed by Dave Bautista) and made him seem like a little mouse to him was crazy. We truly got to see who his character and what he is as Princess Irulan(portrayed by Florence Pugh) describes him, ""He's psychotic."" Even in the final moments of the film with the phenomenal battle between Paul and Feyd-Rautha, to the other houses coming to fight, the Fremen was especially how we see Chani(portrayed by Zendaya) lose Paul's trust and love. Even as we see the toll Paul's sister takes on his mother, Lady Jessica(portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson), is cool and seeing her embrace her role as a Mother. And even in the end, though the story doesn't feel complete, it seems where it comes to that conclusion we will never know what happens next. But it is confirmed that Dune Messiah is in the works. It gives you a feeling of interest and suspense as you see Paul and the Fremen prepared to take on the rest of the Houses and potentially the rest of the galaxy.

In summary, Dune 2 is a truly phenomenal film and the best film of this year. It will stun and blow everybody away from its phenomenal storytelling, to it's incredible visuals, Dune 2 is a must see film of this year, and my opinion, one of the best films of the decade. That's why Dune 2's a 10/10 film!",POSITIVE

"Mar 30, 2024","First off how is this movie PG13 and who thinks this is ok for 13 year to old to watch? Over all good movie and if you did not see the first one recently, I’d watch it first. Some of this movie though they just rushed it, so some of it felt out of place. Minus one star for that. Please don’t take your 13 year old to this.",POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024","I think that this movie can be long at some points but there is a great story with great action, AND acting. I think this movie is a must see. My favorite part of the movie was when Feyd-Rautha kissed his uncle Baron Harkonnen! I really do love this movie.",POSITIVE

❌ spoilers ❌
I was gonna wear a Anakin I don't like sand shirt but it wasn't gonna deliver until Sunday 😭. I don't love the first in my opinion it's one of the most OK films I've seen but it sets up for this juggernaut of pay off. This honestly makes me hype for what there gonna do next and this feels like the hype that we got from the what are the rings or the original Star Wars trilogy it's a real modern classic. Cinematography and set pieces blew my mind you just feel the scope the same with blowing up the helicopter things was really well done. I can't find much negatives here Austin Butler was introduced pretty late but still had a big presence and this man can do great impressions. the climax was just prefect even the small details of Paul Telly Chani that he would always love her until the day he stopped breathing then asking Princess Irulan to take his hand was such an unexpected twist, but makes sense when you stop to think about it in the bigger picture he is royalty after all, and has to do certain things for the bigger picture until he can ultimately find happiness. Perfect movie. Grade A+",POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024",This movie is seriously EPIC.,POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024","well made movie, but differs way too far from book. 1984 version (& scifi too) was closer (believe it or not).",NEUTRAL
"Mar 30, 2024",Don’t waste your money or time.  The original 1 and 2 were much better. Sure today’s special effects are nice but half the Story and plot was written over.  Where was the wearing module  ? And the ending was left off. Never saw the navigator s the whole movie,NEGATIVE

"Mar 30, 2024","Not quite perfect although not having read the book I can't comment on the accuracy of the adaptation. Slow to get going but definitely one that would benefit from a rewatch as there's so much going on. If I was nitpicking I'd say the whole nuclear weapons angle could have been cut out and lost nothing. That aside, it's a very good film indeed.",POSITIVE

"Mar 30, 2024","I am happy I managed to watch it on the big screen. Amazing cinematography(As good as Blade Runner 2049), great sound, excellent acting - Those are the things I liked the most. The story was interesting with way more action than the first movie, which made a way easier to be watched than the first one. The thing I didn't like was the fights, which for me were poorly executed.",POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024",A example movie must watch the only problem with it would be that you have to watch the first but still an excellent movie despite it.,POSITIVE

"Mar 30, 2024","Dune 2 was released in 2024 and is the sequel to the last movie of the same name. Based on the Frank Herbert series of books it stars Timothee Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Stellan Skarsgard, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Zendaya et al. The plot is somewhat complicated so let's just say it's the classic good vs evil, ruling empire vs the rebels, with a little Romeo and Juliet love story mixed in for fun. It's directed and co-written by by Denis Villeneuve. The visuals are breathtaking, the acting is incredibly good, it features fantastic special effects with excellent fight scenes, and the script was also great. The only negative for me was the ending which was clearly just a set up for Part 3; I would have liked for the movie to end about fifteen minutes earlier but that's just me. Overall, Villeneuve has shown again why he's one of the best directors in Hollywood as this movie was epic. Best seen on the big screen so if possible hurry out and see it!",POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024",Better than the first Dune and sets up Dune 3 nicely.,POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024",It was good.  Get plenty of rest this is a 3 hour movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024",Once in a lifetime experience. Must watch it in a big screen. IMAX with laser recommended.,POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024","I watched the first and part two both today, which was quite overwhelming- Dune is intense. Visually, the film is genius with perfectly composed shots, special effects, and the colouring was epic. The use of sound was essential and the sound itself with the already epic soundtrack is not like anything I've ever heard (IMAX is LOUD. So skip it if your not good with seat-shaking level noise). The story gets more intense in part two, and requires full attention. All. The. Time. I have to say, having not read the book(s), some parts are confusing, and I lost track of what was going on at times. The casting was perfect, and I can't imagine anyone else playing any of the characters- especially Paul was perfectly cast. Every creative choice fits perfectly into the overall feel of the film- the world that it exists within, and the characters themselves. I feel as though I have witnessed something truly spectacular in cinema. Now I gotta read the books...",POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024",Superb!!! Denis Vs magnum opus! Wow.,POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024",Great action and characters but it did seem a little short as in it seemed like they had to compress too much in the time allowed and left some key elements of the book out.,POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024",I loved the movie! I need can’t wait for it to come out on streaming services.,POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024",The second part of what looks likely to be a trilogy delivers precisely what was required. An epic in every sense. Breathtaking cinematography and very well directed. Austin Butler with a standout performance.,POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024","One of the greatest Sci FI movies I've ever seen. The scale is epic, the acting and direction were flawless, the world was stunning, and the score blew me away. Best of all, Villanueve appears to have been as faithful as possible to the source material which is frustratingly rare these days. This movie was incredible!",POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024",Awesome follow up! Hope there's a third one,POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024",This was simply excellent. Movie fully delivered and was very well done. If you are fan of the Dune Series of books this one (and Part 1) bring to life those books.,POSITIVE

"Mar 29, 2024",I just thought it was a lot of fun,POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024","It was good, non-predictable, 7 1/2 8, a little long but of course part three because there was no solution.",POSITIVE

"Mar 29, 2024","E' difficile parlare di questo secondo capitolo della saga di Dune senza scontrarsi con quelli che sono i suoi ovvi pregi e i suoi altrettanto ovvi difetti. Per quanto riguarda i pregi questo film fa esattamente ciò che un sequel dovrebbe fare, vale a dire incrementare la spettacolarità, l'azione, l'epicità e la posta in gioco. Denis Villeneuve si riconferma essere uno dei più autorevoli registi di questa generazione cinematografica, riuscendo a dare il giusto peso sia ai momenti di intimità e di quiete che ai momenti più monumentali. Ogni singolo fotogramma del film potrebbe essere esposto in una galleria non soltanto per la sua fotografia ma anche per l'impeccabilità degli effetti visivi. E' però anche vero che la regia di Villeneuve può risultare a tratti eccessivamente didascalica e accademica, senza la veracità e la visceralità che certe scene richiedono e raggiungendo degli spunti di sperimentazione in pochissimi momenti in tutto il film. Dal punto di vista narrativo il film è spaccato a metà, nella misura in cui nella prima metà si prende il giusto tempo (e forse anche troppo) a delineare la cultura del popolo dei Fremen toccando tematiche che lasciano lo spettatore con degli interessanti spunti di riflessione. Nella seconda metà però il film subisce un'accelerazione ingiustificata degli eventi e dell'evoluzione dei personaggi, con un cambio di rotta repentino subito dal protagonista che diluisce completamente il suo tumulto interiore e la tridimensionalità della sua caratterizzazione. Allo stesso tempo molti altri personaggi sono criminalmente sacrificati a favore di modifiche rispetto alla storia narrata nel libro che, oltre ad essere ingiustificate, sono state dettate contemporaneamente dalla voglia di chiudere le vicende del primo capitolo della saga letteraria e dall'impossibilità di dare il giusto spazio agli avvenimenti più importanti in un film di due ore e quarantacinque. Molte cose che erano state preannunciate nel primo capitolo non hanno la minima ripercussione in questo e allo stesso tempo viene ripetuto lo stesso identico errore, anticipando avvenimenti che verranno sviscerati chissà quando uscirà il terzo capitolo. In buona sostanza si tratta di un film che, al netto dei suoi pregi e dei suoi difetti, è alla pari del primo perché alcuni aspetti sono senz'altro migliorati ma altri che dovevano essere corretti vengono trascinati anche in questo e risultano dunque più gravi ed inaccettabili.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 29, 2024",Impresionante producción y reparto. Superó la 1er entrega.,POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024","Absolute stunning film, visually, you can easily get lost in just watching everything happening around the actors. Story was a bit choppy for me and I think that's due to editing and I wish their would be more payoff to the visions.",POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024",Too much fighting and religious overtones.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 29, 2024",Stunning visuals but the divergence from the books story makes for a frustrating experience. Essential subplots are cut out making this 2 hour 45 minute movie feel rushed. Hopefully the third installment will find a way to bring back the heart of this story. Im not sure why Hollywood keeps deciding to do adaptations that veer off from what made the books great. I cant say more without spoilers.,POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024",Looks and sounds absolutely incredible. One of the greatest sci-fi movies you will ever see,POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024",The greatest cinema experience of all time,POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024","Though impressive in its ability to make dunes look duney. The rest of the flick is boring beyond words. Much like the first one, this one has ideas in it that are just mumbled through and you miss most of the dialogue. Perhaps you had to read the book beforehand to understand. OR, the issue is that there are derivative movies that were inspired by Frank Herbert's novel and mined with better execution.

I do not understand the overwhelming love of this movie. It feels so...pedestrian and mini-series milked dried. They REALLY take their time to get to a point.
Also, the drudgery of seeing a pretty dune and then...nothing.
This movie is all intellect and zero emotion. A frustrating movie to sit through.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 29, 2024","Great watch, see it in a Dolby experience and every thud and every breathe kept me in perfect suspense. At times the visions and forecasting can be a bit confusing or distracting but not enough to distract from the truly epic size of the story and further potential. Set up perfectly for the third instalment.",POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024",Even better than the part one.,POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024",The effects and cinematics were fantastic. The plot was just boring like the other Dune films. They could have made it a superb piece to remember but what happened? Star Wars movies are far more interesting. Let it die out like all the other 250 superhero movies!,NEGATIVE

"Mar 29, 2024",What a masterpiece. The characters designs the world building and the character ares are amazing. Going from seeing austin Butler as elvis presley to seeing him as a bald physico is so good as we know he can play so many different characters and he did this one perfectly. Timothee chalamet was also an incredible actor in this as per usual.,POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024","I really like the scene after he drinks water. Made me audiobook Book Two and now I'm a Dune fan I guess lol. But seriously, that scene is so sick. The entire movie is good but I've thought about that scene every day for like 3 weeks now.",POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024","Great setting, direction and visual effects. The casting is so great too. Recommend to watch it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024","Without question, Dune: Part 2 is a that oh-so rare, untrendy thing: a modern masterpiece, albeit a flawed masterpiece. While the ultra-minimalist, Marie Kondo stylings of the desert are visual gift that keeps on giving, and the character arcs and foreshadowing on display here are of the highest class, there's a ""but""..

Despite the brilliant set up from the first movie, did anyone else get the impression that the Fremen were never really in danger..? Between the giant worms, seemingly endless swathes of foot soldiers, perfectly tune to their environment, there's the inescapable feeling that the Harkonnens never really stood a chance - despite Austin Butler's incredible turn as Feed Reutha.

However, the pros here far outweigh the cons, and Dune: part 2 is going to be discussed for a very long time. I'm a believer that the original source material is more important/influential than it is actually good, but Denis Villeneuve's interpretation of Frank Herbert's galaxy is treat for the senses",POSITIVE

"Mar 29, 2024","I have seen Dune 2 a total of 3 times. Once on an XD screen, once on a Dolby Atmos and once on a laser IMAX. IMAX is for sure the way to see it.

I think each time I have seen it, it's gotten better and I understand a little more of the story. A real feast for the eyes that's for sure, the music, the sound etc this movie is a real masterpiece. I don't care how good your living room TV with a 72 inch screen and surround sound is. It simply cannot compare to watching on a huge IMAX screen with a laser projector. And no, nobody in the theater is talking or on their phones because this movie is just too good to not keep your eyes glued to the screen. See this in theaters while you still can, you will not regret it!",POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024",did not disappoint I've been waiting for this for a long time and I can seriously say that this is probably one of the best movies I've seen in the past 5 years,POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024","Dune Part Two is a generational Science Fiction Masterpiece. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I was not born in time to see the Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now or Space Odyssey in their moment, so I feel especially lucky that Denis Villeneuve has proven the Hollywood Epic is not simply a lost art form. 

The best movie I've seen since Fellowship of the Ring, my favorite movie.

See it in theaters friends, Imax if you can. 😉",POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024","Excelente Dirección. Excelentes Escenarios. Excelentes actuaciones. La mejor música que haya escuchado en un proyecto así.

"Mar 28, 2024","Loved every minute of it! A perfect mix of majestic soundtracks and impeccable sci-fi picture, blended in with the soft drama and true action on Dune, keeps you pinned on the theater's seat! The small details and loyalty to the source material, tops it with the sweet, delicious cherry. I'd gladly re-watch twice or thrice just to better absorb it all.",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024",Maybe I had too high of expectations because everyone said it was so good. It was beautiful but overall empty. Never caught myself caring for or rooting for one of the characters (good or bad). Some great landscape shots and artsy closeups.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","Great story and special effects.  Stayed mainly true to the original story.  Left you wanting more, but each movie is a full story in itself.    Chris Walken was great as the emperor.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 28, 2024","Denis Villeneuve alongside Christopher Nolan are two filmmakers working today that literally have yet to produce a product that I have not enjoyed, loved, embraced, endorsed, or more than likely added to my favorite films of all-time and, Dune Part II reaffirms this as it is a monumental achievement that transcends expectations and transcends what, as audiences and cinephiles, believe can even be accomplished with a camera.

This was an experience that surpassed even the first film in its scope, characterization, attention to detail, and progression within the narrative that is masterfully and thoughtfully imagined with every frame, piece of dialogue, and a score by the legendary Hans Zimmer that truly made me feel like a kid again.  Watching films like Jurassic Park and The Matrix in a cinema around the time I became a teenager are films that easily elicited pure emotional responses that we don't often get anymore. 

The incomparable visual effects, cinematography, editing, and brilliant adapted screenplay are just a few more of the accolades this film deserves.  The ensemble cast, from Chalamet to Butler to Chanti to Ferguson to Bardem to Skarsgård to Pugh - Denis brings out their absolute best and it is undeniably apparent everyone from cast and crew are eternally invested.

I don't anticipate another film in 2024 that is going to surpass what Villeneuve has achieved and despite a March release, I would hope this is a film that is recognized and appreciated at the end of the year; especially when awards season is in full force.

All I can say, unequivocally, is Dune Part II...was worth the wait (and Stilgar believes).",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024",Part two was great and I followed the storyline just fine. I did not like how they made Zendaya’s character to standoffish and questioning to Paul. She was not like that in the books,POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","Great movie. Long, but I didn't get bored. Great effects, action, character development, felt like I was really in this world. Part 2 is way better than Part 1.",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024",Cinematics and cinematography were excellent...   ....and sticking to the story line so much better than the 80's original attempt.  When's Dune 3???,POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","I liked it quite a bit.  There were some changes to the story that I have a rough time accepting, particularly the ENTIRE re-write of Chani is not what I would have done.  Why do I give 5 stars?  Because the amazing content that Denis and the crew and actors provided is just so fantastic, and it's impossible to do a Dune movie so hey, very well done guys, I appreciate the insanely hard work and talent.

My favorite interpretations so far have been Feyd, big time, Stilgar, Peter DeVries, and the entire treatment of the Sardaukar.  The worm riding, fascinating, I never thought about doing it that way, I get it, just hadn't thought about the worm just staying far enough out of the sand to keep the exposed segments out.  Makes it look 20X more dangerous, serious excitement.

All around great experience, I can't wait for the next installment.",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","This is why you go to the theater!  Good Movie, but you need to watch the first one to understand it all.",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024",I was disappointed with the artistic license taken at the end.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","Visually spectacular, otherwise empty. There are some interesting ideas lurking, but these remain unexplored.
The story makes no sense and is actually rather silly; the lead characters are neither interesting or sympathetic, with as much character as cardboard boxes. 
Perhaps 3 stars; five stars is absurdly generous.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","Stunning, entertaining, breathtaking.",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","It's visually stunning and there some very good performances by the key actors. But, but. The first half drags a little and the film overall lacks light and shade with the action sequences sometimes just too relentless. Also I don't like the portrayal of Chani, it's rather one dimensional and seems to be a slightly lame nod to the fashionable 'kickass/badass strong female' thing. I preferred the first film.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 28, 2024","dune part 2 
It is a great culmination of different genres (Sci-fi ,adventure,action) 
The score by Hans zimmer is just enough to sweep you of your feet......
Timothee Chalamet is just so good especially in the third act 
highly recommended",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","I need to see it again to give it a revisit.  However, it was much better than the first.  Better plot development and engagement.  Despite me not liking Timmy, he did very well as the lead.  Visually powerful and a great film all around.  Saw at Sunset Megaplex.",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","Espectacularmente impresionate, la trama se desarrolla a la perfección las escenas de acción tienen buenos efectos visuales, el protagonista logra transmitir sus sentimientos de manera que te envuelve en su mundo y su sed de venganza.",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","It’s crazy that a movie can be this good . Dune 2 needs to win an Oscar at least or we might as well do away with the award altogether . It’s like the first time one sees Titanic or Transformer or Harry Potter , one of those start of great movie franchises that so stunningly original , never-seen/before cinema techniques and ideas …so exciting from beginning to end . This will go down as one of the Greatest for years to come . Gosh , I am worry about Dune 3 , can it even come close ?",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024",Beautiful and entertaining.  Looking forward to part 3!,POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024",This is way above a movie. It’s an experience that should be felt. ,POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","When is part 3 coming out, lol",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024",I am extremely impressed. The story is fascinating and some of the action scenes are amongst the finest I have ever seen. It's a bit long but never boring. My only reproach would be that old and new important characters are not fully developed and are only given very few brief scenes. I guess that only means that the surviving ones  will be more present in a third installment (Dune Messiah),POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024",Awesome movie! I can't wait for the third part.,POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","Amazing visually, great acting, edge of my seat",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","Amazing cinematic experience it was, absolutely.",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","This is better than the first in every single way. Not saying the first was bad, still a good movie but this movie is peak cinema.

"Mar 28, 2024",This is hands down the best film I've ever seen. Everything was so massive. The acting impeccable. The story is so well told. Every character so perfectly cast. The make up and costume design are second to none. Unbelievable.,POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024",What a masterpiece!!! Visuals the acting the soundtrack!!! Great sequel.,POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","This is literally the best movie I have ever seen in my life. Part 1 + Part 2 has surpassed everything else for me, be it sci fi or fantasy. In IMAX, it's a theater experience I've never had before. It was clearly built from the ground up for the IMAX experience, and I noticed a big difference when seeing it in a regular theater. I've seen it 5 times and I'm only stopping because it's dropping out of IMAX. I genuinely believe that this is the equivalent of witnessing Star Wars in 1977. I've never been so engrossed in a movie, or seen this quality in cinematography and sound design.",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024",IMAX Experience! Just a dmn good movie!,POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024",Just a really weak film all around.,NEGATIVE

"Mar 28, 2024",Brutally boring. I'll never get those 3 hours back. So confused.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","Not my cup of tea. No character development, convoluted, basically just an excuse for special affect battle scenes. If you're an 8 year old boy who enjoys pulling the wings off flies, this is for you.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 27, 2024",Consertesa uma das melhores continuações da história do cinema junto com filmes como poderoso chefão 2 e as duas torres,POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024","Beautifully made, stunning visuals and soundtrack.  Acting was great.  The ending felt a little rushed.  It was the tone of the movie that I didn't find appealing.  Most of the characters were scheming and unlikeable.  It was so hard to care about the protagonists due to being so manipulative and self-serving that I could care less about the ending.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 27, 2024",Liked Visual effects.  Dialog was poor.,POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024",Special effects scenery were great.  Did not care for the movie or acting.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 27, 2024","Absolutely amazing.  This was my second time seeing Dune Part Two, but the first time on IMax 70mm.  Wow!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024",Best movie i have seen in a long time! Don't let the run time scare you! it's very entertaining!,POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024",If you liked part one you won't be disappointed,POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024",Did not like the dark turn that the movie took. I think it is leaving itself open for a Part 3.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 27, 2024",Wonderful movie. Cinematography was on par with the very best and every moment of the film was gripping.,POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024","Incredible, if you dont see this in an IMAX you will be missing out on a once and a lifetime spectacle! 

Not since The Two Towers have i felt such elation and magnidicence. 

Watch it now before it leaves theaters, make haste!",POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024",Refreshing to finally see a movie in Imax worth seeing. The visuals were absolutely stunning and overall it was just a super present viewing experience. Even though this movie was almost 3 hours it only felt like it was an hour and half long.,POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024","Obvious set-up for part 3, 4, ....   Well done but could have been done in shorter time or more story in time used.  Too much 'dead' time",POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024","Ok I loved the first part of this so my review is going to be a little biased but, this has to be the best sequel I've seen in a long time. Everything is bigger from the brilliant effects to the script and the acting, the cast is stacked with top tier names, the sand worms are a joy to behold whenever they're on screen, they look awesome. The music is fab, it's just an outstanding film. The only negative I have is that you really do have to have watched the first film for most of this to make sense, it's not a sequel you can just jump right into without having prior knowledge of the first films events like you can with some follow ups. Cracking movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024","Denis Villanueva has given us a visually stunning, riveting, and breathtaking sci-fi masterpiece that perfectly encapsulates why IMAX exists.",POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024","Absolutely legendary. This definitely sets the bar for all of the other Sci-Fi and Fiction movies who are looking to be considered as one of all time greats, because this one sure is.

Visuals - 10/10
Cast -  10/10
Acting - 10/10
Cinematography - 10/10
Sound/Music - Epic.",POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024",Such a good movie. Id watch it again,POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024","This movie delivered on stunning visuals and seat-shaking action, but still suffered from poor casting of the main protagonists, spotty storytelling, and sequences or features that made little sense.  Part of effective an sci-fi movie experience is the suspension of disbelief, where something may not be possible or likely in the ""real world"", it is supported within the ""imaginary"" world that is created.  In the case of the Dune remake, it's simply distracting.  As a fan of the original movie, I had high hopes for this remake using modern technology, but left with a ""decent, but not great"" impression.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 27, 2024",Still boring . It uninteresting don't care about characters. Glad when it was over. But it is better then the original with Sting.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 27, 2024","Simply stunning, Epic and Beautiful.",POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024","After this film, my faith in the trilogy was restored🌒

When I watched the first part some time ago, I wasn't very impressed. The film was very slow and the excitement didn't start until the last 15 minutes. This film, on the other hand, was thrilling from start to finish. There were many memorable moments and the excitement was tense most of the time. The fact that time flew like a bird while watching this film was a special expression that there was no lack of excitement.

Also, I can't say that the film was too abrupt. There was love, depression and compassion very cleverly woven in. The film offered the whole spectrum of emotions.

Speaking of the actors, Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides did an excellent job, offering both character development and the inner dilemmas of gaining power. One could get quite a deep understanding of the phrase 'power corrupts'. Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha was also excellent. The inner psychological instability reflected in him was extremely convincing.

Visually, the film was extremely well made. Combined with the music by Hanz Zimmer, the visuals were so evocative that in some moments I found myself shivering. Definitely a film to experience in the cinema. Excellent.",POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024","An epic tour de force which is somehow still as deceptively barren as its namesake. Superior to its prequel, if only because most of the best stuff was reserved for this second outing, the story is now familiar to any who have seen Avatar: the outsider will become the aboriginal, and then lead them to glory. That Avatar was much inspired by the story of Dune doesn't really change the fact that the blue-skinned ones somehow did it better. Dune is a much more serious affair, of course, but its espouses true depth of character for its epic story and visuals. We never really get close to anyone - they are all pieces to serve the story. The love story is fine if predictable. I still don't know how the sandworms move, or why they don't submerge and throw off their riders, or what they eat - but the rule of cool dominates here. We have a much more dangerous villain in the young Harkonnen prince, and the movie takes the time to convince us he is worthy before he goes up against Paul Atriedes. But, villains be damned, for the story really hinges around Paul fulfilling or not fulfilling his destiny, both of which have serious consequences. I didn't really understand why, in the end, he had to do what he did, but he seems blessed with Dr.Strangeseque Endgame foretelling, so apparently this was the only choice. Hmmm. What IS great, is the last Act, which I won't spoil here, but which takes a twist away from novel and the older movie version, a twist for the better I would say. And the music... Zimmer really pulled out all the stops this time, with a soaringly tragic love theme which is just sublime. For all its shallow thrills, I greatly enjoyed Dune 2, and if it feels familiar it is really because Dune has inspired so many other stories in turn, so credit where credit is due. What will be fascinating is seeing where they go next, for the sequel novels were trippy to the point of incoherence often. Let's hope the movies, as they seem to be, truly chart their own course ahead. Dune doesn't rival Star Wars or Star Trek... yet. But it may...",POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024",I didn't understand anything about the movie,POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024","Enjoyed the show especially the scenery. The plot was the same as the original except for the ending, looks like there will be a third episode.  The sound was too loud at times didnt think it needed to be.",POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024","Like the first movie everything works well except the warfare, anything above a skirmish struggles to look like all out war - and with a couple of years of what real war looks like taking up regular news daily, there's a vast disconnect between that and having 10 minutes to wrap up a battle for a city/planet in movies. The other thing Villeneuve's Dune movies lack is any sense of who lives in Arrakeen, a city without citizens.
Them's the quibbles. Everything else builds on Part 1's set up and follows through effectively with more of everything people liked.",POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024",Epic visually yet ponderous in pace. Too loud in the theatre (as always).,NEUTRAL
"Mar 27, 2024","A gigantic proof of how an almost mystical image and sound can catapult you anywhere, even in the depths of the desert, every blink of an eye during viewing is a step on living sand.",POSITIVE

"Mar 27, 2024","Denis Villeneuve’s epic storytelling of Dune continues and gets even better as the world-building and character development gets cranked up, not to mention action, humor, and emotion. Excellent directing, film-editing and if it doesn’t win best cinematography, sound-editing and best original score at next year’s Oscars it will have been robbed.",POSITIVE

"Mar 27, 2024","Honestly i have never watched a movie that has had such amazing cinematography along with its modern day remake of the the original Dune saga. I was skeptic of how they would conclude part 2 and it has me taken away comepletey, Not many films make me wanna rewatch it for a 3rd or 4th time just falling inlove with its IMAX Film ratio. I will be investing more into my home threate system so i can rewatch the home media version on Blueray once its released",POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024",Very good. Better than the first. Smooth pace. Beautiful end. Action packed. Not a boring moment. Can't wait for the next.,POSITIVE
"Mar 26, 2024","even better than the first part, which was already great but had to be used to explain the basics of the Dune story. The story really picks up speed in the second part and also contains unexpected twists",POSITIVE

"Mar 26, 2024","The movie was a great continuation of the first movie.  I've seen a lot of reviews saying you don't need to watch the first movie to watch the second, I disagree. Watching the first movie gives you the gravity of what's happening.",POSITIVE

"Mar 26, 2024","I liked this movie and went and viewed it twice but the ending did not follow the book but then it more suggested a Part 3 . The book that came out illustrating this Part 2 makes not a mention of a Part 3 or even a thought pattern related to such.....maybe an entirely different venture with ""aged"" new actors but my suspicions are there  will be a Part 3. The views of the desert are great....definitely a visual movie.",POSITIVE

"Mar 26, 2024","The first movie had me enthralled, while the second is good and looks, sounds amazing it didn't build the story as much as rolled it out. Still way better than many of the movies out there and worth your time. Very curious if the next installment will stun or fade out.",POSITIVE
"Mar 26, 2024",Its Amazing! The grand sci-fi movie everyone is hoping for.  The visuals and sound are most notable but the plot and acting are all top notch as well.  Another all-time classic from Denis.  The only downside is that the next movie isnt out and ready to be watched!,POSITIVE

"Mar 26, 2024","Visualmente espectacular, Dune 2, enfatiza el medio socialista en pro de promover la paz envuelta de ""dictadura"", la necesidad de creer en algo más grande o más allá de nuestra comprensión para ""pelear"" tanto literal cómo figurativamente; Tanto los Harkonnen cómo los Fremen, se cimentan en el miedo para crear elegidos que fortalecen la fe ciega de su población hacia un mejor futuro. El cómo la película plantea la postura del elegido en Paul y Feyd-Rautha me pareció increíble, continuando con la visión del ""falso elegido"" que la primera película había explorado, pero ahora visto desde dos diferentes posturas, pero guiadas por el mismo resultado, ""ser una solución ante el planto poco visible de ambos planetas"". Una solución que vemos paralelamente con la historia principal, manipulada por externos que únicamente buscan el poder, creando la duda en el espectador si realmente nuestro protagonista es el elegido o solo es una profecía que todos necesitan que se cumpla, siendo testigos del cómo verdadera o falsamente, Paul adoptó esa personalidad, que cada vez parece que se hacera a repetir los errores ególatras de los extintos Atreides. Una dirección impecable, tanto en crear tensión en escenas expositivas como en escenas de acción con una sobriedad espectacular, una fotografía que adopta los mundos extravagantes de películas europeas de finales de los 50's pero con un toque contemporáneo fantástico, posiblemente los mejores actores de su generación congeniando en una película que reluce que tienen todo el potencial para ser la nueva cara de Hollywood, una banda sonora memorable y envolvente del genio Hans Zimmer. En síntesis, una película que sobre para todos los medios técnicos para hacerse llamar obra maestra.",POSITIVE
"Mar 26, 2024",Visually fantastic and the sound was amazing. The story starts a little slow at first but it really picks up about a quarter of the way in and then the second half was just a masterpiece. Highly recommend watching in IMAX. Totally worth it!,POSITIVE

"Mar 26, 2024","Along with Part 1, they had 2.5x the time to tell the story, but told less than Lynch's did. Paul's importance is diminished. Chani's is now against him? How and why? Alia's not born? So instead of Paul becoming a man and a leader over 5-6 years time period of war with the Harkonens, it all happens in less than 9 months? How do you cast Christopher Walken as the Emperor, then have him dress and act like a feeble old man? In the end, how could they do so many things right and still get so much wrong? Read the book, watch the Lynch movie and SciFi series. Re watch these two films and see if you agree.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 26, 2024",A grand and beautiful journey that reminds you why film is great. Strong performances and plenty of breathing room help this adaptation subvert your expectations while remaining true to Herbert's text in all the right ways.,POSITIVE

"Mar 26, 2024","I liked the first one, but I like this second one more. The visuals... are great. I haven't read the book, the only thing I'm missing is why they didn't use the same voice weaponry they used on the old one. Anyways great movie, recommended.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","I think I read the book for the first time 50 years ago, and several more times since then. It's not easy to turn a nearly 900 page book into film, and Denis Villeneuve has done it.  It's a fine line to make it understandable to newbies without angering fans of the book, and make a bang-up film at the same time. Well worth seeing, amazing effects and a pure set-up for Part 3.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","If I were an unimaginative 14 year old with no idea what guns were or what to do during a full scale war for the highest power, I would probably have liked this film.

They are a reason they a respected by the Fremen but also feared. There is a reason that strangers treat both of them-and later Alia-as unnatural. 
As always, Gurney and Stilgar are my favorite characters, and they both get some satisfying screen time here. 
My big problem with this movie is pacing. Villeneuve is so in love with aesthetics that he practically rushes through certain plot points to get to more scenery chewing, so that those scenes don't have enough impact.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",It shines in cinematography. Costumes. Acting. And set. The film is visually stunning. And is a fun time. A EPIC MUST SEE,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","This is a fantastic sci-fi that I highly recommend to plan coming to the theater 30 minutes after the start time. The previews are 30 minutes of aggravating non-sense with maybe one movie I'll make an effort to watch in the future. 

The first Dune was a lot of story building that truly blossoms in the sequel. I can't wait for this series to continue with the third and fourth installments.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",Really freaking good!! I want more!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","I thought it was very well done, much like the first one.  I'm not gonna lie, I am having a hard time with the hard re-write of Chani in variance of Herbert's work, but at the same time, my gosh, no one else could have done as good a job as Denis. And Zendaya did a great job in playing the role as it was written for her, outstanding.

Feyd, played by Austin Butler, is a stunning interpretation and speaks so deeply of what it is to be Harkonnen.  But all the cast did an amazing job.  Xavier was a wake up call to me, where have I been that I don't know more about this actor.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",Was looking for some uplifting moments like Star Wars.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 25, 2024","Too many disparate parts and pieces to be a coherent tight sci fi flick. Dialogue was unimaginative and mvoie overall was at least 30 minutes too long. Compared to the very best sci fi films such as Blade Runner, Total Recall, The Thing, it just doesn't measure up by a long shot",NEGATIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","The sequel to this epic science fiction story has finally arrived and the adaptation of the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert has finally come to an incredibly satisfying conclusion. It follows Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen people of the desert planet Arrakis to wage war against House Harkonnen. While accepting his nature as a new Messiah, he must face a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the universe to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. A visually thrilling masterpiece that will go down in history, together with its first part, as one of the best science fiction stories of all time. Denis Villeneuve has built an immersive and unbelievable world for this franchise with such detail that it is just marvelous, and this time he explores religion, fanaticism and fighting for freedom with this story. The movie is a spectacular experience in the big screen, IMAX preferably, with the stunning and cinematography and impressive visual effects. The costume design and the production design outdid themselves with this second installment. And the sound and Hans Zimmer's score continue to amaze viewers with its epicness. The 2025 Oscars will definitely have Dune Part Two among the biggest contenders of the ceremony. Also, the whole cast gives its best, especially Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Austin Butler and Rebecca Ferguson. Even Javier Bardem's Stilgar that gives the movie some of the best comic relief moments of the movie. Ultimately, so epic and captivating that I want to read the first book right now!",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",Loved it! Watch it on IMAX!,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","What a treat for diehard fans, what a treat for the broader audience to be invited for a truly philosophical journey. Villeneuve managed to create a more than worthy vision of Herberts ideas. And please don't stop with Messiah. Denis, do dem Dune books till Nr. 4 ""God Emperor"". Only you can succeed!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",It's very mid it's definitely not a must watch it felt pretty generic and rushed wasn't what I expected you should only watch it if you are a big fan of dune and you want to follow the story while watching it it felt like it was to long and I was hoping for it to end at some point during the middle it was dragged out and it's way too overrated,NEGATIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",Very consistent to the book.,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",I liked the close up shots and the cinematography,NEUTRAL
"Mar 25, 2024","Excellent movie making - film direction, cinematography, casting, music (Hans Zimmer!) - everybody did an amazing job with a fantastic plot. Also - I am very hesitant about the use of computer graphics in movies these days as it tends to be very corny. BUT this movie did a GREAT job. Go see it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",Awesome!! Looking forward to part 3!!! ,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",Violent and boring. Even Zendaya has only one look on her face the entire time.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","An absolute masterpiece of the film. For reference: I've never read the books. I only ever watched the Part One and found that film to be a near masterpiece, with this one superseding it slightly and moving into a perfection zone. Anybody giving this less than 5 stars simply does not like cinema",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","This was a great movie all around! It was a long movie but was entertained the entire time! Great story, acting, action, visual and sound effects. One of my favorite movies of all time!",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","I loved every about it, except no teaser at the end when there clearly has to be another sequel.  Ending did seem a little rushed but loved to hear more about the inner workings of the realm.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",Quiet long and somehow boring at a time,NEUTRAL
"Mar 25, 2024","Cinematographer Greig Fraser does some truly unimaginable work here. In essence Dune2 is a realistic work of art, and constant orchestra of astonishing visuals that should be seen on the biggest screen you can find. The complex character development was profoundly convincing, the action sequences were energizing, and in particular it felt completely vivid. The field battle with Feyd-Rautha (played by a pale skinned/albino-ized variant of Austin Butler) was almost entirely devoid of color, making the most uncanny feeling of fear. Hans Zimmer  chose sounds that upgraded the climate and emotional resonance all through the film. In spite of its lengthy runtime, the film kept an ideal speed, guaranteeing that practically zero scenes were wasted and that each second added to the overall journey.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",Epic. Must see on big screen. Villeneuve should direct all the scifi movies from now on.,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","Never left a cinema after almost three hours and immediately wanted to book the next session. The buzz after watching this was crazy, honestly cant compare it to anything. Torn between appreciating part two in all its glory and desperately waiting in anticipation for part three. Edit: ended up going back and watching it thrice more",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","An incredible sci-fi epic! The visuals, music, and acting were all phenomenal! A few changes from the book, but they enhance the overall storyline and drama.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","Never saw the first one because I heard it was boring. Decided to go see this because my daughter wanted to go see it. I was extremely entertained. I'll admit, the storyline is confusing, but in a way that makes me want to go see it again. Austin Butler, Stellan Skarsgard, and Josh Brolin are fantastic! 

Also, I guess it's time to watch the first one.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",I saw this film in IMAX and it was incredible. While almost 3 hours long I never once lost interest. It was visually beautiful with a great soundtrack. This is a must see for any sciencfi enthusiast.,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",Best experience cinema ever,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","Even better than one, I wouldn't change a thing.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","One of my favorite movies ever. Not necessarily one of the ""greatest movies ever"", but one I could rewatch endlessly.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","For people that haven't read the book and aren't emotionally attached to the novel, this will be a fun romp big screen movie with lots of action.

For those who care about the book, whether you like this movie or not will hinge on how you feel about the adaptation's changes to Chani. They took a lot of editorial liberty with her character. In some ways, it makes the adaptation feel like the book was adapted to modern sensibilities, but also, it makes me a little sad to see the book not adapted as faithfully as it could have been.

It's an excellent movie, it's just not a perfect adaptation of Dune, whether that bothers you is up to you.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","Didn't particularly love the first one but thought this one was worth a shot. Still not sure if it's entirely my thing, but I cannot deny this is well done. To steal a non particularly unique take - Lawrence of Arabia meets Star Wars.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",We thought the movie was great.  Very glad we rewatched part 1 before going to keep the storyline straight.  We hope they make a Dune 3 to continue the story.,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","I liked it, but soundtrack, and visuals , and Javier Bardim+Austin Butler do all the heavy lifting. 

The first 1.5 hours basically could have been summarized before the actual movie started, in a small scrolling paragraph shorter than a star wars intro. It was painfully long. The most recent Avatar was about the same length,but it didn't feel like it to me. This FELT like 3 hours. 

The 2nd half was good and fun. 

Zendaya is a good actress, but looking at her scowling face got old. Christopher Walken seemed to not care he was there, and also just seemed out of place in this universe. 

My biggest gripe is that the original Dune movie from the 80s, was just one film, and covered more ground/lore than both of these dune movies did at triple the run time.

Austin Butler was the biggest surprise.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 25, 2024","It was a stunning, epic movie, based somewhat on the book.
Standing on its own, I asbolutely loved this movie. It looks great. The character arcs are nicely done. It has a bit of a problem with pacing at times and the Feyd Rautha bits feel a bit off. But all in all it's one of the better movies that I've seen recently.

But it's based on a book, so it's not unfair to compare it to the source material.
And there it falls a bit short. It can't be avoided that a book like Dune gets simplified when brought to the big screen. But from the richness of themes in the Dune novel, Villeneuve seems to have picked only two: ""the danger of charismatic leaders"" and ""Paul's struggle against becoming a messianic figure"". And he REALLY wanted to make sure that the audience got it. Which leaves out a lot of the other themes and scenes from the book.

The biggest changes are of course his relationship with Chani and how he basically just gives in to the holy war that will be fought in his name. The fact that this surrender to his ""destiny"" happens rather fast makes it a bit jarring.

Good movie. Good acting. Very impressive visual effects. As an adaptation of the book it falls a bit short.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 25, 2024",Spectacular in every sense. A magnificent blockbuster of galactic proportions. ,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","Even more than Part One, this ""Dune"" deserves to be seen at the cinema as the sound and scenic design are both incredible in contribution to the epicness of the storytelling. Its story telling is layered with thematic allusions and respect for its audience to draw upon these themselves. To so finely balance such restraint with the bombast of the big moments of its aesthetic is no easy feat and reflects the craftedness at the core of all aspects of Denis Villeneuve's direction.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","An absolute tour de force of cinema. I've never read the Dune books nor seen any previous adaptations, and yet I was drawn into the Dune universe in such a profound and powerful way that it will stay with me for years. This film is what storytelling in cinema looks like.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",A visual spectacle and the sound was incredible as well.,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","Literally a masterpiece, loved it. I would love to rewatch this beautiful work yet again!",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","Stunningly beautiful, yet compromises on the themes and deep subtlety of the source material. Although some of the changes were probably necessary to fit the movie into a reasonable run time, it wanders way too much for this to be the case with all of the changes. 

As a whole definitely worth watching, however, the more I think about it the less am I really satisfied.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 25, 2024",Looks amazing. Incredibly boring movie. Fergusson and Butler deliver brilliantly. Zendaya and Chalamet performances are weak. Musical score was predictable and unimaginative.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","Villeneuve's Dune Part 2 delivers an epic spectacle. A visually stunning and absolute pleasure to watch for fans for Frank Herbert's Dune.  It left me wanting more.
The casting, storytelling, cinematography, effects are incredibly strong.  Chalamet, Ferguson & Bardem were especially good. 10/10. Villeneuve adaption of Herbert's Dune is awesome.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","At the end of the movie, when the Great Houses refused to accept the ascension of Paul Atreides to the Imperial Throne, the logical, obvious response was NOT to go to war, but rather simply to withhold the shipment of spice.  Without spice, the Great Houses would come around soon enough, without warfare.  And by the way, why bother with an Emperor in the first place?  An expensive, useless layer of government, more trouble than it's worth.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",The movie was amazing!!!!!,POSITIVE

"Mar 25, 2024","Awesome, however Timothe is the worst casting as he is not intimidating at all.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","After seeing ""Dune: Part Two"", I can confirm it's not only the best film of 2024 so far, not only that it's Denis Villenueve's best film, but that it's quite literally one of the best action films and sequels of all time, rising up to the status of ""The Dark Knight"".
The beautiful cinematography keeps it 100% just like the first movie, despite it being set in mostly desert territory. Every character is perfectly executed, written beautifully, and I'd say Zendaya, Bardem, Chalamet, and Butler were the beating heart of this film. Paired together with one of Hans Zimmer's best scores, a gorgeously sinister overlook into the future (hint hint, Dune: Messiah); this is the makings of perfect storytelling, paired with some of the best action and fight scenes put to the screen. VFX is phenomenal in this as well, along with the costume designs for everyone.",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",Phenomenal. One of the greatest sci-fi films of all time!,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","It’s the perfect mix of twilight, GoT, Star Wars, & True Blood",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",I think the Dune part two was even better than the first one. Exciting from start to finish. I can't wait until the next one drops. Love the fact that people who haven't seen the first Dune you'll still love it and understand what is going on.,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",Epic film - very true to the book,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",Rousing yarn.  Could've done with a little less Chani/Paul romance chitchat…and the deviations from the source material.  Javier Bardem was spectacular.,POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","I'd say the story was old and stale but the books are 40 years old so perhaps that explains the same story I've seen before. Yet another movie that didn't need to be 3 hours +. Seen it all before. Fight sequences are so up close like always. Fast cuts. No real feel of the battle. Special effects are good, but I do that for a living and once again seen it all before. Actors are good, but young. Love senerio is contrive, and prophecy is weak.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 25, 2024",Great visuals but disappointed in how Chani gets screwed over. Hopefully there's a part 3 where that wrong is righted,NEUTRAL
"Mar 25, 2024","Phenomenal! Cinematography, score and script were executed perfectly.  Can't wait to experience it again...",POSITIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","I haven't walked out of a movie in a longtime, feeling the way I did about #DunePartTwo. Allow me to explain…

The characters, the visuals, the storytelling, the dialogue, the action, the music, the sound design, everything about this movie was CINEMA PERFECTION! 

It truly is one of the best sequels of all time and Timothee Chalamet knows how to lead a movie. Zendaya stole the show. Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler, and Dave Bautista were sooo GOOD as well!! 

When I tell you I had tears in my eyes, I did. Not because the movie was sad, but because it was beautiful. If you're a movie buff like me, or you love sci-fi in general, please watch this movie.

"Mar 24, 2024",Could've been so much better. They stole Alia's moment and gave it to Paul. That was utter garbage.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 24, 2024",Best movie of the decade. It is rare a part 2 out does the 1st. But in all honesty it does not feel like a sequel bc it just picks up exactly where part 1 finished. Well worth it saw it twice!,POSITIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","It was certainly epic and something to see on the big screen, preferably in IMAX. It is a slow burn though like Part 1. If you have issues staying focused on something for 2 and half hours, this may not be for you. I don't know if I liked it as much as Part 1, but I want to watch it again when it is on streaming.",POSITIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","Well, I really wanted to like it. But the first 3/4 of the film drug on. And on. And mercifully lead to the frenetic conclusion...which resolved little. The psychotic died, the Emperor bowed to Paul (and did the director really think that the knife was stuck in Pual's right shoulder when clearly it was sticking out of his left side a moment before? Sloppy!) The ending...Paul leads the fighters off to fight the other houses in battle in space, Chiani leaves for the South to lead her people, and we walk out without any true conclusion to a story. At this point, I have no desire to even see a part 3. No stars.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 24, 2024",Epic. Visuals. Sound. Story adaptations,POSITIVE

"Mar 24, 2024","So much fun, can’t wait for Dune Messiah. Really hope it gets greenlit.",POSITIVE
"Mar 24, 2024",A great conclusion to Herbert’s epic. Takes enough liberties to be well-adapted for the screen but stays faithful enough for the message to remain strong.,POSITIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","Pretty good, but felt long - great movies dont feel long!",NEUTRAL
"Mar 24, 2024","Dune: Part Two not only successfully carries on the many great things about Part One, but also elevates them considerably. The world building alone continues to be so out of this world. Patrice Vermettes production design absolutely deserves a lot of the credit for that. The makeup work as well as Jacqueline Wests costumes are even more imaginative this time around. Greig Frasers cinematography here officially solidifies him as one of the best directors of photography working today. As I was watching the many visual effects sequences, I kept wondering how the hell did they pull that off?!. Having caught this in IMAX, the sound work and Hans Zimmers score both shined through all the speakers surrounding me.

The performances are also more enriching in this installment. Timothe Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson both continue such strong work here as Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica, respectively. Meanwhile, those who had less to do in the first film have a lot more to do here. Zendaya as Chani, Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, and Javier Bardem as Stilgar are each in great form. Not only that, but I thought Zendaya also shared some great onscreen chemistry with Chalamet. As for the new cast members, Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (in a move 10 times more interesting than his overrated performance in Elvis), Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, and even Christopher Walken as her father, Shaddam IV, all make for great additions.

Most of all, the story is so emotionally engaging from start to finish. Not only that, but it also kind of feels relevant to whats currently going on in the world. The film itself may be a bit of a slow burn, but Joe Walkers editing thankfully keeps the whole thing well paced. Theres definitely a lot to unpack here, but thats what subsequent rewatches should be there for. In any case, Dune: Part Two absolutely deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Its EPIC in every conceivable way imaginable!",POSITIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","Dune: Part Two is wonderful, it's one of those 'once-a-decade' experiences, 3 hours that feel like minutes... A different world, you feel immersed, you live it. A soundtrack that drowns you in adrenaline and emotion. Breaks filled with art, landscapes on par with Vincent Van Gogh.
Truly lively performances, Rebecca Ferguson and Austin Butler truly shine!!",POSITIVE

"Mar 24, 2024","Great adaptation of the book.  Doesn’t follow all the story lines, but captures the essence of the story.  The characters are mostly spot on.  Timothee needs to develop more chutzpah towards the end, but overall a good performance.",POSITIVE

"Mar 24, 2024",Fantastic cinematography. Solid science fiction epic.,POSITIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","I really disliked this movie, Dune2.  It is only CGI, and more CGI and way too much noise.  Frank Herbert, the author of the novels, had created a real world.  Not my favorite book in my taste, but at least it was real creativity, you learned to care for the protagonists.  This movie , Dune 2, does not explain anything of what is at stake here and why,  Only Zendaya stands out in what is otherwise a boring, noisy and way too long movie.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","One of the best sequels ever made. It improves on pretty much everything that was a bit rough with part one mainly the pacing is perfect. It balances being slow with big payoffs of incredible action that is filled with massive scale and scope. The special effects are excellent and even though the CGI is noticeable it's always used in original and epic ways. The camerawork is top notch and you always feel fully immersed in the world. This looks and feels truly epic. Austin Butler steals the show in the acting dept and that's saying a lot because everyone is giving A grade performances across the board here. Tim & Zendaya are good together but the chemistry could've been a bit better perhaps. Really the only slight issue is while editing is really good overall, it feels chunky at times. This has tons of ideas and goes very slow to fit it all and never feel bloated. Sometimes it can be a little hard to follow every particular plot point but the direction is so strong your able to get the general idea. Compared to the 84' one this improves so much it's not even comparable. The romance is perfectly interwoven, explored, developed and fleshed out, and feels earned rather than hammed in. It allows you to digest ideas much better and Stellan as the villian is way better here and not cartooony like the other one. The acting here balances being serious but never emotionless perfectly as well compared to Lynch's. Everyone should give this a try once. Dune 1 can be a bit slow to get through but the payoff is worth it to watch this. All Time Classic.",POSITIVE

"Mar 24, 2024",There was a ton of action in Part 2. Felt like a stronger standalone movie than Part 1. Good plot,POSITIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","Impeccably cast, Timothy, Zendaya, Florence, and Rebecca shine, each bringing their characters to life with authenticity and depth. The fight scenes are uniquely satisfying, allowing each character to showcase their skills without feeling rushed, a refreshing departure from typical movie tropes.",POSITIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","Nearly a perfect movie. Fantastic acting, visually stunning, gripping soundtrack, great writing and dialogue. The powerful soundtrack really carries this film. 

Something to improve would be the pacing during the first quarter or so of the movie. They could've also focused more on the war scenes, which felt rushed.",POSITIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","Its a great movie and also difficult to watch because its a war movie with violence, Dunes version of gore, a high body count and complicated decision making by characters you may have come to love and respect.",POSITIVE

"Mar 24, 2024","I liked the movie, but i also think there are quite a few issues. I also believe the original story is so complex that the fans are thrilled anyone made it into a decent movie. Maybe also the fact someone finaly brought back some seriousness into big budget sci-fi (khm Marvel). Casting is poorly done. The main characters simply can't pull it off. On the other hand the giants of acting that stand besides them haven't been given enough to work with. First thing that comes to mind is Edward Furlong in T2. That kid, that young, and inexperienced pulled off way harder task than Timothy. There's simply not enough oomph to him. Zendaya was just a vehicle, and a pretty face to drive to the final plot twist, rather than a desert warrior on a distant, savage planet. I give it a decent rating, as i hope it will become a beacon of light to lead the Hollywood future. I believe lots of critics do it for the same reason.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 24, 2024",Front end was a bit slow. Not sure about Christopher Walken being cast when he did all those comedies. Second half was pretty good.,POSITIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","The movie was well written and acted, but a bit underwhelming since there isn't any significant conclusions to this part of the story. Of course, the 2nd book was the same so there isn't really any other way to make the movie. Just be warned that this part of the story is essential to how the main character becomes the leader he is prophesied to be, but it develops slowly.",POSITIVE
"Mar 24, 2024",Is it called Dune or DUDE!!!!!  Epic movie. Amazing acting.,POSITIVE

"Mar 24, 2024",A Magnificent cinematic experience.,POSITIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","Love the books and movies and part 2 is indeed an epic but why such a focus on Chani? It's the story of Paul, not his concubine! That last scene focussing on her looking angry as the movie closes left me empty and bewildered. Compare it to the triumphant final scene in David Lynch's Dune - now that's a climax!",NEUTRAL

"Mar 23, 2024","Same things over and over, people walking, tense victorious music, fighting and back again.

"Mar 23, 2024","A great movie to see at the theater. This gigantic visual spectacle features some characters you know from the first film and some interesting new ones, including Christopher Walken. It is visually stunning, dark, complex, and draws from great cinema and deep historical references of the past of human history. We saw it in IMAX which is well worth it. This film is definitely want to see in the theater and you should not wait to watch on a television. You will only get about half the effect on a TV screen. That said, the film was a bit long, and despite a few slow moments, it kept us fully engaged, and felt and thrallingly real, despite its other-worldly characters and planets. Truly, an inspiring piece of cinema, the captures, both the human spirit, the conflict of humanity, the flaws of emotion, and the goodness of the human spirit. Great cinema! ",POSITIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","While the cinematography was grand, the movie felt long and drawn out. The score did absolutely nothing to help. Also, the story did not follow the book enough, especially in terms of character interactions and the timeline. I have no plans to see this again.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","Dune: Part Two delivers stunning visuals and action, continuing Paul Atreides' journey on Arrakis. It's a lengthy film with a rather complex plot, so be prepared to invest some time. If you enjoyed the first movie's sci-fi world, this sequel offers a return to that epic adventure.",POSITIVE

"Mar 23, 2024","SPECTACULAR! Tbh the first movie did not impress me much, but this Dune 2 is truly magnificent! All the setting from the first movie led to a satisfiying and cathartic resolution. The combination of incredible scenotography, music, and story makes this movie a must watch. ALL HAIL SPACE JESUS!",POSITIVE
"Mar 23, 2024",This movie made me do a complete 180 on how I felt about Dune. One of those films that you must see in IMAX if possible. Everyone brings it. An otherworldly experience.,POSITIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","It's rare when a sequel exceeds the prequel in such a magnificent way! I loved Dune part one, but I loved Dune part two even more! This is a must see movie, even if you haven't seen Dune part one, you will still love Dune part two. There is nonstop, action, there is romance, Intrigue, and plenty if surprises, twist and turns. Bring on Dune part three!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","This movie was the most boring movie i ever seen in my life. I belive bucky larson born to be a star has more action than this. 
If you wanna watch it make sure you bring a blanket and a pillow as you will be sleeping for 3 hours. The movie didn't make sense, it would go from one end to the other, started telling one story and the next 20 minutes, interrupt the story with another story, then going back to the story it was initially describing.
The end was super mega lame.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 23, 2024",this whole movie is a feast for the eyes. a sci-fi masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","Though the scenery is amazing, the movie is made of up of endless sequences of stupid dialogues and excessive dope-induced violence set in the desert lasting for almost 3 hours. The topic of spice has not been developed. The battles are unrealistic. How come the Harkonnens, enjoying total air superiority, destroyed a well trained army of the House of Atreides in part one... only to be decimated by a bunch of sword-armored, worm-riding Fremens in part two? A better title would be ""Dune 2: the gangs of Marrakkesh"". Finally, the baby-faced Paul Atreides was not convincing at all.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 23, 2024","Nearly Perfection! Denis Villeneuve delivers an epic and stunning cinematography lesson. The cast is wonderful, i just love Javier Bardem and Rebecca Ferguson; tbh, the 2 main characters - Timothee & Zendaya, seem a little fragile/delicate for this story. Other than that, everything is top notch!",POSITIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","The grandiose settings and superb audio-visual experience are undeniable in this film. However, the sluggish pacing, abrupt character transitions, and poor performances from the actors make it difficult to give it a high rating. While it surpasses its predecessor in some aspects, it still falls short of greatness.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 23, 2024","poor adaptation of Frank Herberts masterpiece ,Dennis should have more respect for the Author",NEGATIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","Honestly confused by the negative reviews, you would have to watch this with ear plugs in and your eyes glued shut in order to not enjoy this masterpiece. To the guy who said David Lynch's dune was better, you are out of your mind. 6/5 could not recommend it more. Watch both back-to-back for 5 hours of cinematic ecstasy.",POSITIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","I had high expectations going into Dune: Part Two, but whatever they were, this film completely blew them out of the water. This film looks just as good, if not better than the 2021 original, and this films writing and direction is just so much better than the previous film. That isn't a knock on the previous film though, as I thought they did a great job in the same departments there, but in this film it was just so good that I'd be lying if I said they were equal. I even had to go back and change my score for the previous Dune film after watching this one, as this was so much better in almost every conceivable way. This film truly used its 166 minute runtime to the fullest, as there wasn't a single scene in this film that I didn't find necessary or compelling, which left this film feeling a lot shorter than it really is. Hans Zimmer's score also elevates this film to new heights, as it fits so well with the film, but I think it's a captivating score to listen to even outside of watching the movie. With all of its amazing landscapes, and beautiful effects, this film begs to be watched in a theatre. This film also does greatly at expanding the world and characters of Dune, by adding depth, and introducing new elements, which makes it all the more interesting to watch. Paul has such a great arc and a ton of character growth throughout this film. Overall, Dune: Part Two is a fantastic follow-up to the 2021 film, and is easily the best new film I've seen this year so far, and realistically, it may not be topped, though we we are still early into the year so anything could happen. Go see this on the big screen. You will not regret it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","Can't believe there are so many good reviews, the movie is a mess, the story is piece by piece. If you only like the good scifi scene, this is for you. Otherwise, such a waste of time to watch this boring and long movie.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 23, 2024",Excellent movie. It makes you want to even see more. ,POSITIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","Plot goes completely against the source material. Why can Hollywood never just stick to the book. If you want to write your own story, make your own movie, don't ruin someone else's work!",NEGATIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","It is beautifully shot. Far too loud for no real reason except to entice emotion the writing could not.  No character development for the heroes and especially not the antagonists. No touching on Herbert's philosophy in any meaningful way. Lots of slow motion esoteric future foreshadowing scenes that explain very little but make run time as long as it is. Seemed rushed when explanation was needed and dragged when the point was more than clear. Not sure why everyone is saying it is so good? Another shining example that ""Idiocracy"" is a documentary.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 23, 2024","Absolutely amazing.  I liked the first Dune a great deal, but the second installment is a masterpiece.  The special effects and soundtrack were breathtaking and the Villeneuve has really brought Frank Herbert's vision to life.  The cinematography is second to none and I can't wait for the third one to come out.  There are so many great scenes to discuss, but it can't be done without spoilers, so do yourself a favor and go see this one in theaters for yourself.",POSITIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","Not anywhere near as good as the first movie.  Way too long with long stretches of the movie where nothing is really happening.  Movie builds up to the end battle which is way too short leaving you with the ""that's it?"" feeling.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 23, 2024",Oh my god literally a cinematic masterpiece.,POSITIVE

I thought the acting was good but the story had more evil in it than I thought it would.  The mother creeped me out and I didn't like the dark turn in this sequel.  Nothing against the acting, I just didn't like the dark edge to it and also it skipped around too much as in not explaining all the time in the desert. I will probably not go see Dune 3",NEUTRAL

"Mar 22, 2024",One of the best movie experiences of all time,POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024","They ditched subtle characters of Part 1 in favor of one-note caricatures. Rebecca is no longer the conflicted mother-BeneGeserrit-wife with complex relationships with Paul and others, instead reduced to a series of plot-moving villainous actions. Stilgar no longer a complex, competent leader (think of the way he handled meeting Paul and Jessica), but a literal joke. Chani is just a bad character compared to how she was in Part 1 (and certainly the book). The character has nothing to do besides scowl and walk away from things, has vague, psychologically implausible goals, and has absolutely no chemistry with Paul, and that all comes from the direction and screenplay. I don’t think Zendaya is to blame. And beyond character writing, it’s just not as thrilling or involving as the psychologically motivated direction of Part 1. That movie was like a trance. A strange masterpiece. And the action had real danger and implications for the characters and you felt that. Part 2 is just a lot of lifeless action bluster, half-hearted humor, and simplistic dialogue scenes.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 22, 2024","Such a great adaptation of my favourite book. Definitely didn't disappoint. Visually spectacular- the screen direction is impeccable. The storyline was true to the book & was a great adaptation, being able to appeal to the fans & not leave those new to the Dune universe behind. 
It's rare that I'm not looking at my watch in a 3 hour movie, but this had me fully entertained & engaged from start to finish.",POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024",I literally made an account so I could rate this movie. I think about this movie daily - it's my Roman empire.,POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024","""Dune Part 2"" delivers an impressive cinematic experience, skillfully blending stunning effects with a captivating storyline. It's a movie that undoubtedly warrants multiple viewings. What sets it apart is its faithful adaptation of the source material, in stark contrast to earlier versions. However, while Part 1 remained loyal to the book, Part 2 takes some liberties with the original storyline, introducing significant changes to both plot and character arcs. Some elements, like the iconic weirding ways and Paul's sister, are notably absent or altered, which may disappoint avid fans. 

For those unfamiliar with the source material, understanding Paul's decisions may prove challenging, as the movie doesn't delve deeply into his visions. It would have been beneficial to explore this aspect further to provide better context. Reading the book beforehand enhances the viewing experience, offering deeper insights into the characters and their motivations.

Excitement brews as the movie hints at future installments, although it remains to be seen how they will fare. While following the second book might not resonate as strongly with audiences, the prospect of a continuation is intriguing. It will be fascinating to observe the direction the series takes.",POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024","I think it's a slight dip from the first movie, mostly due to its script, but still very good. Beautifully shot with some excellent acting particularly led by Javier and Rebecca.  Another movie made for adult fans of science fiction, which is a victory for movie lovers and fans of the genre and is becoming Denis's legacy. 

It does feel like the problems of adapting this difficult source material are starting to compound, and the same feeling from the first movie of the story feeling incomplete stings more with this one. After five hours of storytelling, it's strange to still feel like the story is still only starting.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 22, 2024","It could have been way better, the last half of the movie is very rushed, the final fight happened off-screen",NEGATIVE
"Mar 22, 2024","The film is good, but I expected more from this film: the scenery sometimes makes jumps that are not explained clearly. 
If we consider for example the Lord of the Rings part 3 between one scene and the other clearly show where it is happening, while it is not easy to understand the new scene immediately in this film. So, this is why I put 3 stars.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 22, 2024",A watered down version of David Lynch's masterpiece,NEGATIVE
"Mar 22, 2024",Visually stunning! The sound was great.  It was long but never boring.  Mostly true to the books.  I was entertained.,POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024","Total blast! I found it very entertaining.  I enjoyed watching the 1st movie then coming to the theater and seeing part 2.  The purists of the novel will find the flaws they want, but overall it was a fun experience.",POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024",How ever you felt about the 1st Dune movie is probably going to be how you feel about Dune2. I loved Dune and thought Dune 2 was almost (but not quite) as excellent as the firat one.,POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024","This was a movie we've been needing for a while. 

Dune: Part Two knew the success of the first film and continued the story with the same cinematic and world-building prowess as its predecessor. The visuals again were fantastic and I felt encapsulated throughout the movie. The use of sound, and lack there of, created gripping sequences which left me in awe and wanting more throughout. 

We knew what was coming in regard to the story, with Dune: Part One regularly dropping visions of the future throughout the movie. However, a few twists and surprises still found their way into the film which was much needed. Paul's transformation into the Lisan al Gaib was incredible to watch and his arc from the start of the first movie was extensive. A special mention goes to Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha, his performance was exceptional and he embodied the madness and desire of the Harkonnen brilliantly. I also enjoyed the mixture of serious and light conversation throughout. The serious conversation drove the story forward with meaningful dialogue and the light conversation made the characters relatable. 

However, I will say that the film was maybe slightly too long. A few sequences could have been cut down and some skipped altogether, focussing on the core story. I also felt the Emperor could have been utilised more in the film, but maybe that'll be for the next film. These downsides should not put you off though.

All in all, this film was embodied the definition of a blockbuster and I advise you see it wherever you can.",POSITIVE

"Mar 22, 2024","It fucking sucks.
3 hours of boringnessd, half of the people just slept in cinema.
Nothing really emotional, everything pretty forced, it just sucks.
High budget trash film.

"Mar 22, 2024","A masterpiece, visually stunning, great cast. This adaptation stays true to the original Frank Herbert novel and given he wrote six books in this series, hopefully there are many more Dune films to come!",POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024","Absolutely stunning movie, both visually and in terms of its plot. Really setting the standard for the movies to come.

I definitely recommend watching this whenever you can!",POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024","Bizarre, long and drawn out movie about sums it up in a sentence. Music and background movie so loud, hard to hear certain parts of actors speaking. Abrupt and disappointing ending sets stage for an automatic part 3 to the movie. First movie was much better script. This one just screams sequel.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 22, 2024","Truly wonderful film. Such amazing ensemble work, so many good actors. The battle scenes were marvellous, The music was outstanding. It just slipped by and i was so into the film I was shocked when it ended. Villeneuve and Nolan lead the way as stunning directors.",POSITIVE

It puts you right into that movie. Austin Butler played such a awesome character. The sandworms 😱😱 This might be the best movie I seen in ten years and maybe my favorite movie of all time. I don't see any movie this year knocking it out of my #1 spot all year. 10/10 EPIC FANTASTIC movie. I seen it 4 times.",POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024",Villeneuve at his finest.,POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024",I am someone that was not a huge fan of the first Dune but loved the world that it set up. This movie is great because it has payoff to a lot of the things the first movie set up. The length didn't bother me. The action was great.,POSITIVE

"Mar 22, 2024","I found Part 2 way more interesting than Part 1. I had zero familiarity with Dune, so with the first one I felt lost. With this sequel, I got a quick prep on the world and main figures of the plot. I thought it was engaging, and it left me wanting to see what happens next.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 22, 2024",Es una de las experiencias cinematográficas más increíbles que he vivido en muchos años.  La historia es bastante atrapante y no los personajes hacen justicia a la obra.,POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024","Anyone who hasn't seen Dune Part 2 needs to go asap. Though it may be a little long at just under 3 hours, it flows really well and doesn't feel like it. It starts where the first movie left off so if you haven't seen the first one I highly recommend you do that first. It's available on MAX.",POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024",Love the movie. Great acting and story plot. You don’t even have to watch the 1 dune to understand,POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024","Pace was better than part 1.   Feyd-Rautha character was under developed.  The CGI of the troop assemblies and stadium scenes was cartoonish.  I thought the industry had progressed beyond that.  Also having Feyd-Rautha battle in the stadium with poor CGI detracted from the development of his character.  So much more could have been done to show the relationship between Paul and Feyd-Rautha.  Although the villian in this movie had a sense of honor and respect for Paul.  Expected more development.  I am going to reread the book but I thought he had children with Chani.  So I'll hold my thoughts about her going off by herself.  In the Dune book wives and concubines were an accepted practice.  I did like the down playing of Paul's sisters role.  Finally the importance of Spice to the guild was not adequately explained nor was Pauls relationship to him and his abilities.   Spice came off as just a drug.  I enjoyed the Dune books.  I enjoyed the 1984 Dune movie.  I enjoyed this movie but felt, especially with its length, that it could have been so much better.  If anyone failed it was the director, CGI company and the producer that accepted it.  It was not the actors who failed.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 22, 2024","This movie is a beautiful spectacle to behold! I feel so fortunate to live barely 20 miles from one of the few IMAX 70mm theaters in existence, so seeing it in that format is a MUST for this film. I had seen it twice previously on a standard screen, and Dune part 2 stands on its own on the strength of its story, acting, and sound/music…but I truly got the most out of the experience in the format Villeneuve intended it for. Everything has been extended perfectly and ratcheted up from the first Dune, and visually, the seamless and believable nature of the visual effects yet again raises the bar for groundbreaking science fiction.",POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024",Great production of a fun allegorical sci fi classic which does not disappoint! The almost three hours flies by and I can't wait for part 3,POSITIVE
"Mar 22, 2024","Great VFX and world building. A vast cinematic landscape of mystery and War that really feels like an actual living, breathing universe. Really appreciated Zendaya's grounded performance as Chani and the one who doesn't seem completely mystified by Paul Atreides and Timothee Chalamet's performance in this one was quite engaging. His Paul ranges from cool and calm to violent and aggressive. 
The film is quite long but I could have stayed in the theatre for longer.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 22, 2024","This movie was so good I didn't even realize it was almost 3 hours. The plot was crazy good it captivated my attention the entire time. Timothée Chalamet was incredible I was shocked to see him as Muad'dib based on his previous roles, safe to say he's got good range!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024","This is one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. I've never watched a movie like this at the cinema. It's another level of cinematic experience, and not ""just"" because of the beautiful scenes and astounding sounds...it's because of the story, the acting, the incredible direction which gives the movie a near perfect rhythm, so you never gets bored. Dune Part Two is one of the movies that you just need to see at the cinema because you will regret it if you don't.",POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024",It was amazing!!  Closer to the books than I expected and I read the series 40years ago as a teenager….Will be seeing again before it leaves the theatre…very immersive movie…,POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024",The movie was fantastic. The visuals were amazing and loved the cast. Part 2 definitely picks up the pace from part 1. Make sure you do your homework and know all the character's and houses names because it can be confusing to follow if you don't know who is who.,POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024","The music, production, world building and atmosphere is great. It can be very loud I am glad I was in the back row of the theatre it's a loud movie.

I think it has a lot of what the MCU is missing, actual music and atmosphere and humanity MCU feels so Disney it's not grounded in anyway.

I think acting is good for two very young leads but the leads they could have had been 5-10 years older. Timonthee has the best scenes but they could've been more if he had better range, he had the best lines, the best part, everything to stand out. 

Zendaya is good, I feel like she does better than Timonthee as well but I feel the same way, she says Tomontees character is sincere at one point... but in no point in the movie or the dialogue or the acting do I really see it in that character. He has a lot of ego and all this bravado I saw the character as a hyper masculine, leader, who is only doing something to get what he wants ... 

I really felt like the veterans brought out a lot of the power of the film. Javier Bardem saved me from getting bored of the dialogue, he was best actor he had charisma, nuance, wisdom.

It's not really a faithful adaptation and I enjoyed the block buster. They needed a tighter script and better writing to really make a adaptation true to the novels, but it was not a deal braker for me.",POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024",Wow holy mother of all worms!!! In the IMAX 70mm was out of control blast! Not only worth a second & third trip but do it in IMAX!!!! Long live the fighters!!!,POSITIVE

"Mar 21, 2024",Awesome movie. Good storytelling and lots of action definitely recommend,POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024","Dune 2 is operatic on the biggest scale you can imagine. I didnt feel the duration at all beyond wanting a bathroom break. Everything in it is made with such immense and detailed care. Zimmer's soundtrack alone is worth a 2nd viewing. Saw it on Imax. If you're into GREAT sci-fi do yourself that favour to get the full blast of it. Dune 2 postulates some intellectual/societal challenges but not as much as Blade Runner 1 &2 got to. For me anyway. But just sitting there and watching the remarkable pictures, acting and sound, is worth it. For me I think after digesting more it will rank in my top 5 sci-fi movies, and that starts of with Kubrick's 2001 Odyssey.",POSITIVE

"Mar 21, 2024","This is the best movie i've seen all my life. Everything is perfect. I had goosebumbs every part of the movie and everytime i watched it. You have to see it, and you have to see it at IMAX. Timothee did such a great job with this role, he proved what a good actor he is and that he can play any role he is given and deserves all praise. He is jut that good. Also Zandaya although her character is a bit altered from the book she was such a great supporting character and i loved her all throught the movie. Denis the director has all of my respect and after the first Dune i was in love with his work. Dune: Part 2 flipped my world upside down. After my first time watching the movie I was blank faced. I think Dune: Part 2 has set the bar so high that i will never find a movie as good as this. In addition Hans Zimmer has once again proved that he is one of the greatest composers of all time. Thank for this masterpiece. Also congrats to all the actors because they did such a good job!",POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024",Made me so bricked it was longer than the sandworms.,POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024","I saw this movie opening weekend, and I have never been more touched walking out of a movie. Dune part 2 is everything cinema should be. I love the story of religious oppression, and misguided hope, and faith. I'm sure the few people reading this have all heard these things before. But dune part 2 is amazing. Just, amazing.",POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024","Honestly, the best movie for 2024 really enjoyed. I had a great time. I didn't even realize it was that long because that's how much action there was… I can't wait to see part three!!",POSITIVE

"Mar 21, 2024","If you like scifi, this is an absolute must see, multiple times even! Never has a movie captivated my heart and mind so thoroughly. You will be immersed in the sets and feel like you're part of the desert world of Arrakis. The acting is top notch and the action scenes are so well done, it's hard to believe you haven't traveled in time and space. Most of my other favorite movies have parts that are skippable or kind of cringey-this has none of those. Every scene and dialogue exchange is enthralling and well executed. 
When a movie makes 3 hours feel like 30 minutes you know you have a masterpiece on your hands. My favorite movie of all time, I'm so excited for Dune Messiah.",POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024","an awesome movie, packed with action and emotion. Amazing acting from Timothée Chalamet and a superb display from Austin Butler",POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024","Masterfully crafted, an awe-inspiring experience on all fronts that begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. This isn't your traditional big blockbuster film franchise, and that is not a bad thing. While the first entry in the series was very good, this sequel brings the franchise to new and not often found heights.",POSITIVE

"Mar 21, 2024","Reading the book is still on  my to-do list, but this was a great sequel to first part. Kept you on the edge of your seat, and was easy to follow along with what was happening throughout the movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024","Dune 2 is a good example of a movie that would not work as a play—and that's a problem. Take away the (admittedly stunning) visuals and the droning score that tells you ‘hey, feel something now!', and there are very few moments where plot or dialogue creates true suspense. As a result I was never on the edge of my seat. The plot is driven forward by explicit statements in prophecy or conversation like ""you haven't had a nightmare like that in a while"", rather than making you as a viewer find it out for yourself. As a viewer I'm thinking, ‘stop telling me how to feel and make me feel it'. This movie doesn't ask anything from you as a viewer, hence it's hard to resonate with. Three stars because Javier Bardem is great, the fight scenes were solid, and the world-building is fun to look at, like going to a contemporary art gallery.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 21, 2024","A very good adaptation of the original novel. It's much more compact, fast paced and exciting compare to the first dune movie. the only criticism is that the movie left out some important scenes and character development from thr original book, especially for Gurney and Hawat resulting in a lot of the side characters being a bit one dimensional. Otherwise I have no complaints, it's a great movie both visually and storywise, and also kudos to Hans Zimmer for such wonderful scores.",POSITIVE

"Mar 21, 2024",It is Fabulous!! Great Special effects and the acting is superb! Enjoy on the Big Screen!,POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024","Best big budget sci-fi movie in a very long time. I'm calling it now, next year it wins an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Hands down. It would be very difficult for another movie to surpass the video effects in this sequel. If you haven't seen it in IMAX then I suggest you do because the visuals and audio is out of this world. The bass from the theater speakers were so loud and impressive our seats literally shook every time the characters used the Thumpers to call the worms. No need for DBOX or 4DX! I watched in laser IMAX but now I'm thinking of going to a 70mm IMAX theater.",POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024","The beautiful filming doesn't save the completely abysmal writing—Disappointing. The studio managed to destroy the entirety of what was an incredible start to reimagining one of the most beloved sci-fi novels ever written. Dune Part I had some acceptable deviations from the original text that still communicated the spirit of the novel. The virtues of Part I were nowhere to be found here It felt like the writers were told the story verbally by an executive and told to make it an action film. The studio managed to mischaracterized Chani and Paul—Chani is acted as a warrior and thereby robbing us of certain intricacies of Fremen culture that observing her in the book provides. The studio absolutely ignored Paul's character in the book altogether and chose one aspect of him to harp on because they felt they would get more positive press. They stretched a canvas of 1 dimensional boring character writing over a skeleton of a poorly executed action film story outline. 

The studio rewriting of a story that was beautiful, intricate and beloved already was not only unnecessary but unskilled. The pacing, detail, and beauty of the books was not anywhere in this film. Even without the knowledge of the book, I would have seen this and left the theater wanting my money back. I am embarrassed for the writers.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 21, 2024","Glorious. So many movies today are slathered in special effects, but there's no substance under that wrapping. Dune 2 uses gorgeous cinematography and special effects to mold its epic tale and drag its audience into another world. 

Dune is a classic for a reason, and this telling does justice to its source, setting the bar for what movies can now achieve, and putting Marvel and DC' s recent schlock to abject shame.",POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2024",Visually stunning. Split into two films with the second having a nearly three hour run time and yet it still felt rushed. They changed too much of the story. This version is hardy recognizable unless viewed as a stand alone film. It is not the Dune you are expecting to see.,NEUTRAL

"Mar 20, 2024","One of the few sequels where I wasn't even a little afraid of disappointment. It continues in the same megalomania as the 1st part, with the fact that the plot moves massively forward and opens up new possibilities for the next sequel. For me, it's just a bit of a shame about the unused potential of Stellan Skarsgård, who was nicely prepared in the 1st part, where he acted as a quite threatening villain. But Austin Butler, on the other hand, pleasantly surprised by how he actually acted as such a reflection of Chalamet on the other side.",POSITIVE

"Mar 20, 2024","In my humble opinion, this movie was one of the worst viewing experiances of my life. The first half had little plot progression and almost entirely was world building about how sandy the planet was and more so a recap of the previous movie. The third fourth was paced well and had a good balance of plot progression and character devolpment/worldbuilding. At this point the movie was more so boring at this point, but not horrible. However, in the last fourth or so, the writers crammed the entire take over of the empire into a relatively short period for all that was going on. We went from Paul being a messiah who could cause some trouble to the emperor in what felt like a matter of minutes. We saw very little of the seige on the capital city and only saw Paul and his armies enter the throne room and we are left to presume that he took over hte rest of the city. In general, the sotry and pacing felt wither painfully slow, or rushed to an absurd degree. There are some thing I loved about the movie however. The cinematogrophy was gorgeous, the visuals were incredible, and the score was amazing. In terms of the Sci-Fi genre, this movie does make certain leaps for the genre, but the dramatic flair and spectacle of it can not make up for the horrible pacing which made an otherwise great story feel horrible.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 20, 2024","What a beautiful masterpiece this film was. I enjoyed every minute, every character, and every planet. My only critique is that I feel like story jumped ahead slightly at some moments. Only slightly. I found myself thinking how did we get here a couple of times.",POSITIVE

"Mar 19, 2024","This film accomplishes, so many have failed before. It remained beyond truthful to the original book series. But it was adopted to give equal opportunities to all main characters. To me it is the best movie of all time. Both because of its history and its filmmaking.",POSITIVE

"Mar 19, 2024",Not only one of the best films I've seen in recent years but on of the best sequels cannot wait to see part 3. The Cast and crew did an amazing job. A remake that everyone should watch 10/10.,POSITIVE
"Mar 19, 2024","The IMAX theater played the awful sound so loud that the whole movie was ruined. That weird multifrequency horn sound is possibly meant to convey that heavy machinery and craft are moving in these futuristic structures, with a strong overtone of dread. Well, I felt dread for most of the movie and cringed every time it started again after the infrequent and short pauses. The day before, I streamed the first Dune in this series to prepare, and it was so much more intriguing of a story, and I cared about what happened to the characters. There was more uplifting behavior mixed in with the villain's depravity, while in this one, the villains were really bad, and there was very little to balance that. Even the good guy's actions were conflicted and unsatisfying. It's been so long since I read the book, so I don't know how accurate it is, but any story needs some positive things to happen besides one side killing more than the other side.

Whoever decided to fill the movie with that awful loud sound should have to listen to it randomly for a few hours every week over the next year. Maybe they would get the message that it was way too much. Can you tell I'm pissed about it?",NEGATIVE

"Mar 19, 2024","Fantastic. I decided to read the novel after I learned that director Denis Villeneuve was taking the helm on the Dune remake, having never watched the big screen 1984 release. He's my favorite director and he stayed true to the book. Mr Villeneuve spares no effort in bringing to life author Frank Herbert's imagination and vision, along with his own original touches.

"Mar 19, 2024",The only way to see this movie is in IMAX format - the sound and cinematography are incredible. I've seen it twice and am going back one more time before it leaves the big screen. I really hope the theaters bring this back in a few years to show it in IMAX once again I'll watch it at home eventually but I know it won't be close to being the same experience.,POSITIVE

"Mar 19, 2024",Not a Dune fan. Never read the book. Rated Dune 3*. Saw this last night in IMAX. Worth it. I'd go see it again in the theatre. If you see one movie in a theatre this year it should be this one. Great job by all.,POSITIVE
"Mar 19, 2024",Amazing ride and especially riveting first 2/3 of the movie. Some flawed direction in the last part but the overall experience did not disappoint. Highly recommended for all audiences whether they read the books or not.,POSITIVE
"Mar 19, 2024","This is one of the best movies of all time. Its cinematography was breathtaking. The sets and CGI were so lifelike that there weren't any points where you could obviously tell what was practical and what was CGI. The score was dramatic and helped capture the emotion of the movie and its characters. The captivating plot is brought to life by the incredible acting of Timothee Chalament, Zendaya, and the rest of the star-studded cast. Even those who aren't fans of the science fiction drama will find something to enjoy about this movie. This is the type of movie that will be cemented in pop culture for a long time.",POSITIVE

"Mar 19, 2024","The most wonderful thing about it is that it is a ""great attempt'' to bring to life the very phenomenon that we are always struggling to describe, which cannot be put into words, through visuals and sound.

"Mar 19, 2024",Epic movie i start two days ago reading the fist book hoping to fish all books before release the part three,POSITIVE
"Mar 19, 2024",Great visuals but it felt rushed compared to part 1. I wish we learnt more about Paul becoming part of Fremen community and why Emperor and other houses flew to Arrakis. Even the batte scenes where Sardukars and Harkonnens got wiped out by Fremen fighters felt underwhelming as they were such a strong force in the previous movie.,POSITIVE

The kind of magic that makes no sense, a plot that skips all over the place, characters that magically live under the sand and popup, well,  like magic. The story itself was lame, and made no sense. Even the worms shown were ridiculous. Worms move in a serpentine manner. These worms moved in a straight line. I guess on wheels. Funny, they used balloons to lift the harvesters, incredible technology, but there were no cars to be seen. But somehow they build massive palaces. At least the Lynch version had characters that were intriguing and explained their treachery. Now they are single thread MTV characters. But since there arent any other movies this big so I guess this looks special. It was agonizing, but Javier Bardem was special to watch.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 19, 2024",I enjoyed the movie. But it wasn't this mind blowing event that some movie goers said it was. I went in thinking there was going to be a part 3 but two hours into it I realized this was it. Unless it gets a continuation after what happens on Dune.,POSITIVE
"Mar 19, 2024",Part 1 was far the better than Part 2. Dune is a classic. The books are fantastic … but Part 2 Dune is just noise pollution lacking in any rhythm or sustenance. ,NEGATIVE

"Mar 19, 2024",This movie is an absolute masterpiece from the genius screenwriting to the amazing soundtrack everything blew me away.

It's a long movie but it feels like shorter than two hours long.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","Villanueve has filmed the unfilmable and done it well! He didn't try to replicate the book too closely, with its omniscient viewpoint letting you peer into everyone's heads (as in the Lynch version). He made changes that worked well, making it clearer that Paul's journey is not really as heroic as it might seem on the surface (something Herbert wished had been clearer in the book). I am excited to see him continue the story. I hope he gets the chance.",POSITIVE

I liked the first one a little more, but I definitely wasn't disappointed.  Almost three hours a little too long for me.  Timothee Chalamet is fantastic as Paul.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 18, 2024","It was acted well and visually amazing, but I found it slow and boring with the time passing weird and not caring about the characters.

I fell asleep during Dune part 1 and was told this had a lot more action and it did, but it was chaotic action it was like he learned everything in a blink with a no-show approach.

I would never watch this again I love the actors and they did fine and it was a visual masterpiece, but had I not been the driver for others I would have left.

If you liked Part 1 you will like Part 2 if not save 3 hours of your life and $20. Silverlining it was my birthday so I got free popcorn and a drink at AMC.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","No es solo una buena y esperada continuación de Dune I, sino que la supera en su trepidante acción y el desarrollo de su historia. Efectos especiales y actuaciones extraordinarias. Sin duda la especia hizo buen efecto en la película.",POSITIVE

"Mar 18, 2024","Hadnt been to a theater in years (prefer to stream) but this was such an important movie it was worth paying the money to see it on the big screen. Casting was excellent, especially Paul Atreides, Stilgar and Chani. Costuming and set design was also very strong—it was a feast for the eyes. There are some disconcerting parallels to current events such as the use of religion/faith to galvanize a population of followers to commit violence. 
This is not a movie to see once and catch all the nuances. Cant wait to see it again, but will wait until it is available to stream.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024",well done with attention to detail around the original story,POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","A superb follow-up to the incredible Part One. This chapter shows the rise of Paul Atreides to become Muad'Dib, the savior of the Fremen. A wonderful execution of the original source material.",POSITIVE

"Mar 18, 2024","Cinematography, music by Hans Zimmer, story, themes it was all beautiful.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","Fantastic implementation of the story. Really enjoyed this, wanted more after it was over. The probably could be done better as series to really explore the world and characters with all the backstories but aside from that, pure entertainment with fantastic visuals! The acting was fun and engaging + up for Rebecca Ferguson and Timothée Chalamet whom I was skeptical of before watching this series. All the others were fantastic as well just as expected!",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","TLDR: This movie is good but should have been longer and the changes that they made took away the depth that was provided in the novel.

Close but not perfect, this movie's strength is how it was made. The cinematography, VFX and score, the most important elements of a movie are incredible. However the movie quite honestly wasn't long enough. The transistion between part one and two is sudden and major things change in terms of character relationships randomly like they forgot where they left off. This movie would be very confusing for me If I hadn't read the book. The events that take place over several years in the book happen in a rushed couple of months and creates a lack of depth that is present in Herbert's novel. Further more the movie leaves out the introduction of meaniful side characters and most importantly Thurfir Hawat. Im not mad that Villenueve changed major plot points such as the ending but he seemed more concerned about the narative rather than the time frame and quality of the plot. This movie is still well worth watching, but knowing what could have been is a little disapointing.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","Perfect. Everything from the directing, acting, cinematography, the sets. It was all, perfect.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024",Best movie of 2023 & 2024…. Insane,POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024",I want Timothee Chalamet to touch me,POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","My take: If you want to spend nearly three hours watching dark, depressing landscapes, with dark, simple-minded, depressing mood music behind it, and not even the tiniest bit of levity, or humor...this is the movie for you. 

Oh yes, and don't forget: planet Arrakis has gigantic worms that make ""spice""--a drug that allows you to see into the future (essential for interstellar travel)! But you're supposed to already know this.

And sure, every desert creature on earth is small because the hot sand doesn't provide much to eat, but heck, this is fiction, so all bets are off. Still, the gigantic worms were a blow to my willing suspension of disbelief. Sand is apparently a gigantic worm super-highway--they zip to and fro, sometimes with riders and cargo.

So ... the movie itself hit me with an audible ""thud,"" and simply did not impress at all as entertainment. I actually love some of the cast. In Guardians of the Galaxy Dave Bautista masterfully and hilariously plays Drax the Destroyer but he's wasted as Glossu Raban (a bad guy) in Dune 2. In Guardians, he's delightfully clueless. In Dune 2, he's just clueless.

If you want palace intrigue, like Dune 2 attempts to explore, go to YouTube and watch The Story of Yanxi Palace (Chinese with subtitles). It's ten times more clever than Dune (the book or the movie) and has a spunky heroine to boot.

In summary: Two thumbs down. Oh, and I'm disappointed in myself, too. Dune 1 was, if anything, worse.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","I am in absolute awe of what has been created here. I would have thought that as complex as the story was it would have taken 10-15 hours to tell...was I wrong! What Villeneuve has achieved with both films in less than 6 hours is epic. If you loved the first part...be prepared to be wowed even further. Everything about part two is tight and spot on. Acting, writing, choreography and the special effects are incredible...there is no valid reason this cannot sweep the Oscars next year because it is a perfect film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","Almost 2½ years later, Denis Villeneuve takes us back to Arrakis for Part Two which picks up immediately after the end of Part One, plunging us straight back into the story as if the two films are meant to be watched back-to-back. Everything that made Part One such an exhilarating watch are present and accounted for. Greig Fraser's majestic cinematography of the desert landscape (made even more breathtaking on IMAX) together with Hans Zimmer's Arabesque score are designed for a maximum immersive cinematic experience while Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts' screenplay wrangles Frank Herbert's dense, sometimes soap-opera-like, plotting into something more manageable and audience-friendly. Charting the rise of Timothee Chalamet's Paul Atreides, the last avenging member of the House of Atreides, he'll transform himself over the course of the film into the messianic Mahdi, a figure who blends elements of Islamic culture with the Christian story of Jesus and is prophesied to liberate the Fremen from their oppressors. Meanwhile, his blossoming romance with Zendaya's skeptical Freman warrior, Chani, plays out with hints of a Shakespearean tragedy, and Rebecca Ferguson's Jessica, now taking on a more shadowy and sinister Lady Macbeth-like role, underlines the dangerously exploitive power religious fundamentalism can have in any society in any world. Returning audience will find this sequel reassuringly familiar. If there's no longer the surprise element, at least their heightened expectations should be met and they'll hardly be disappointed by the dazzling spectacle of Fremen warriors riding sandworms and the inspired monochromatic Geidi Prime gladiatorial scene with an unrecognizable Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha. Unequivocally establishing Villeneuve as a master of the sci-fi/fantasy genre, the truest indicator that he has successfully crafted a riveting, coherent and tightly paced film is that its lengthy 2h46m runtime flew by joyously and effortlessly. Roll on, Part Three.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","Masterpiece....i've watched 2x in cinemas.. but still want to watch again... love everything about the movie..Timothe'e is a great actor l, also Austin Butler, Zendaya,Javier B and all the others..all of u make the film so incredible ..also the music..costume...pictures.. this film will gain many oscars next year..",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024",Amazing film. Probably the greatest sci fi epic in the last 20 years. Can't recommend enough. We need more studios and directors interested in making actually decent movies these days...,POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","In my opinion a perfect movie. From visuals to story, this movie capitalizes perfectly on the setup of the first movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024",Entertaining all throughout the movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","Beautifully filmed. Denis Villeneuve's Dune Part 2 is a masterclass in how to make three hours of desert footage look beautiful. The directing and acting were all top-notch. Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet served up a tumultuous love story, but Rebecca Ferguson gave a breathtaking performance as Lady Jessica. Kudos to Villeneuve for bringing this performance to the screen. Dune is a hard film to make. Many have tried. The story is tough, and the environment is tougher. But these two films together are a fine adaptation of a book that most never thought could be successfully filmed. The books just get harder to film from here on out. I'm not sure how Villeneuve will do it, but I eagerly await his take on the next novel in the cycle.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","What a show, this is such a captivating and we'll crafted movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","Visually stunning, but major departures from the book e.g. every bene geserit in the universe feeling him take the water of life scene  (not here), ruined it for me. I've read the book many times in the last 50 or so years, and the characters to my mind are nowhere nearly as two dimentsonal as those presented. In a lot of ways, the old 1984 film was much closer both in acting terms and following in following the book plot.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 18, 2024","Immersive, captivating, epic. Excellent story, sound, action and cinematography. Cant wait for part 3z",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","This is by far the best version of Dune to date.  However, I still liked the first movie with some of the ideas of weapons and the integration of the religious aspects of the  Bene Gesserit. The thing I disliked the most was the integration of the Muslim Madie.  Also, the Muslim prayer rituals.  This is supposed to be a culture of its own,  incorporating aspects of the Muslim religion from our world took away a great opportunity to have its own unique religious demographics. The sandworms seem to be able to travel faster than plausible. The physics of the real world does not work. The sand would have been like a sandblaster, eating through metal and glass like butter. I don't see how anyone could survive riding on the back of one of these sandworms. Gurney comes back from the dead? What the heck! The movie is well worth going to see. It could have been three hours long and still not capture the full flavor of the novel. But, a large popcorn and drink with refills got me through the two-hour and forty-five-minute movie. Oh, I almost forgot about the two bathroom breaks too. I will probably see this movie again, it was that good.",POSITIVE

This is 10/10 for me",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","Visually striking, a must see in theaters. Villeneuves' care and appreciation for the for the source material is once again present, while some elements were drawn back for the screen, the choices made sense. Frank Herbert would be proud of this interpretation and its one I look forward to revisiting.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","Probably the best an adaptation of this source material could be, but that's not to say it's actually good. Dune looks amazing, with great camerawork and excellent effects, and it manages to build out the world by treating the 'alien' cultures of its setting with respect, but ultimately the intricacies that make Herbert's story a classic prove difficult to portray on screen, making the end result a dull watch underlined by a gratingly bad soundtrack.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 18, 2024",First part was better. These reviews are backwards. So different than the books and original. It should have been called something other than Dune 2.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 18, 2024",In my opinion overdone and very narrow story line OK with me.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 18, 2024","Denis Villeneuve's latest masterpieces. One of the best sequels of all-time. One of the best Sci-Fi films of all-time. Truly breathtaking in every sense of the word. Chalamet & Butler are sensational; delivering the best performances of their careers. Also, Rebecca Ferguson is jaw droppingly good!",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","More like Dune your mom amirite

Jokes aside, I feel this movie does better when you watch it back to back with part one.
Looking forwards to Dune Messiah, though I get the feeling its going to be very different from the books.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","While a little long at almost 3 hours, Dune part 2 continues the story and feels like it ups the pacing of the first movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024",Spectacular!! This was such a welcome change given all the rubbish coming out of Disney.,POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","I cannot help but feel that, despite some well-made characters developments, the director sacrificed too much runtime to massive spectacles - adding unnecessary extra time to an already long and not always rewarding ciname session. Unless being blasted with deffening soundwaves and nearly trembling from your seat is considered a hreat cinematografic achievement.... 

It is also rather disappointing that there is no closure of the storyline at the end but rather the promise of even more spectacle.... I am guessing that all critics and many viewers who commented here are 2 generations behind me in age and cinema experience: when I grew up (in the 60's and 70's), not the massiveness or quality of CGI and surround sound was determining for the experience, but rather the quality of acting and story development. The 1984 Dune movie version, which I recommend you all to see, told the whole story in one session. True, in Villeneuves version there is more character development, there are more storylines with even a few surprises and of course the mise-en-scene is magnificent. with Fremen warriors popping up from under the sand, magnificent worm rides etc. Yet I cannot help but admire the 1984 version - in character developments and storyline more limited. because only one film, in effects obviously far behind the new version (except for the space navigators, watch at least that part !), and yet depicting the whole essence of the book. And at least you can follow what is going on on-screen, which is more than can be said for the massive battle scenes of the 2024 part 2.. a positive exception being a.o. the superb fight scene between Paul and Feyd Rauta. Kudos to the excellent martial arts artists who made that !

As regards the acting, both 'Paul' leads have their limitations. Kyle Mc. Lachlan in 1984 came across a bit wooden, yet believeable, Timothee Chalamet in 2021 and 2024 is probably technically a great actor.... yet somehow I do not feel the emotions...

All in all I had expected more from this part 2. Not in runtime or in spectacle, but probably in story progress !!",NEUTRAL

"Mar 17, 2024","The movie was great. It didn't feel as long as it was by far. The theater was impossibly loud, had to plug my ears during parts of the film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 17, 2024","Perfect successor to Dune Pt 1 and equally perfect predecessor to MESSIAH. 
Timothee's presence echoes through his portrayal of Paul, especially as his evolution from Paul to Muad'ib to Duke of Arrakis. He truly found his way.

The first was gravity the second interstellar the third blade runner 2049 which to this day is the only movie it felt like I never blinked the whole run time ...reference is just to give some idea how astonishing awesome dune 2 is ..every aspect of this film is almost flawless...from the direction to cinematography to the sound production the authentic locations to acting and dialogue which has real weight and philosophical depth...my nephew who I watch it with wanted to go straight back into the cinema to watch it again ..me I just hope I'm  still alive to see Dune messiah !!!",POSITIVE

"Mar 17, 2024","A great follow on to the first part, visually stimulating and amazing music.  I would say that there is not much spark between the main characters but that storyline is just one of many.  I thought TImothee Chalomet did an outstanding job.",POSITIVE

"Mar 17, 2024",Awesome/epic special effects and battle scenes but slower and less gripping than I would have expected after reading the book. It would have made the movie way more gripping and believable if the Harkonnens had been presented at least a tiny bit more like genuine human beings instead of monsters.,NEUTRAL

"Mar 17, 2024","Truly an amazing movie on all fronts. The cinematography, audio, set design, acting, and the story are all top notch. When I saw this movie in IMAX, I felt totally immersed and it was awesome.

Captures the bleak, fascist, and brutalist vibe of the Harkonnens amazingly. Feyd-Rautha (played by Austin Butler) is KILLER in this movie.

We also get to see how powerful the benne jesserit ploy truly is, and how Paul reacts to his part within the ""prophecy"".",POSITIVE
"Mar 17, 2024","As a book lover, Dune Part Two is nearly a perfect adaptation with some liberties taken that make it a much more enjoyable movie experience. All of that aside, the cinematography is a breath of fresh air in recent memory. Will watch for years to come.",POSITIVE

"Mar 17, 2024",I loved every moment of this movie! Denis Villeneuve has made another Masterpiece! It is better then Dune Part One. Austin Butler was my favourite character! Zendaya as Chani is the hero of this movie!,POSITIVE
"Mar 17, 2024","Dune part 2 continues Villeneuve's masterclass is visual storytelling. The story is driven forward at a pace, yet time is made for the intimate and quiet. 

The added cast bring mostly phenomenal performances, and it is a shame that we don't see more of Austin Butler and Florence Pugh. Indeed, this is likely the primary criticism, but with such a strong, wide and talented cast, Villeneuve mostly balances the story telling beautifully.",POSITIVE

"Mar 17, 2024","First of all I love the visuals und the music and would go a second time to theater to watch it. What pisses me off on this 3rd version of Dune is the change in Chanis(Zendaya) personality. She is angry girls for almost the entire movie with one angry expression. for Jesus Christ  who wrote her character? and why nobody told her to use more then 1 face expression? Also Paul can see the future there is no way he could be stabled by Feyd-Rautha. 
However looking forward to the 3rd part",POSITIVE

"Mar 17, 2024","it was alright. I liked the David Lynch version better. This version was slow and really didnt get into it as well as Lynch even though Lynch strayed from the novel more.  I think it spent too much time and effort in being ""inclusive"" The acting in Lynch's version was far superior with the amount of well-seasoned actors it had.  The acting in this version made the characters feel hollow and you really couldnt get invested in them",NEUTRAL

"Mar 17, 2024","Pretty much all of the positive things you've heard about this movie are likely true. It's epic, intriguing, seat-clenching, and it does an amazing job of bringing a sci-fi classic to life on film . It elevates the action, drama, pacing, and universe-building from the first film. If you enjoyed the first one, you'll definitely love Dune 2. If I had any critiques, they would be that the sound mixing can sometimes make it difficult to hear the characters speaking in English, and that you do feel the almost 3-hour runtime after a while. However, I feel the grand storytelling more than earned this runtime and the movie is still a solid one overall. Greatly recommend!",POSITIVE
"Mar 17, 2024","IF Dune part 2 is any indication of how movies will be in 2024, then I'm going back to the theatres.  Without a doubt, this movie blew my mind with how great it is.  Power through Dune part 1 because it'll be worth it with this second part.  It was amazing.",POSITIVE
"Mar 17, 2024","Epic!! Doesn't drag at all except for a few moments between chalamet and zendaya (speaking of which, damn he really did her dirty that was ice cold).

"Mar 16, 2024","SPOILERS ahead (not complete spoilers but there are major plot points discussed).

For the most part of the first half, while the movie has its action moments, it is pretty much not what you'd expect.

There is little progress, as the guerilla fighting of the fremen fedaykin against the Harkonen intensifies. Paul is smart enough to keep his head down, and just be a fighting fremen, as he understands that his future depends on him being accepted as fremen. The Harkonen troops are certainly weakened by the retreat of the Emperor's Sardaukars (the Sardaukars are not shown leaving, but they are no longer in any of the fighting scenes).

However, the Atreides family traits are bubbling under the surface of young Paul. Nevermind the explosions and the fighting, these psychological traits are the subtle things which drive the entire movie. While some appear on screen for maybe a couple of seconds, they drive the entire plot. The defiance that the Great Reverend Mother talks about is seen here and there in young Paul, but when you stop to think about it, defiance was surely present in his father. Paul shows it for seconds, before the box test, or in the start of the second movie, when he says he wants to revenge his father. And after Paul becomes Kwisatz Hederach, which trait exactly becomes dominant? Its defiance! Exactly what the Great Reverend Mother feared. He becomes uncontrollable. There is always the question if the world would be better with the Kwisatz Hederach controlled by the Bene Gesserit. In many ways, it wouldn't. But the world in control of a man which has this particular character flaw (defiance)? You can pretty much see what happens. Universal war. All because Paul basically cannot accept not being Emperor. It is not clear if there would be a future for him in a world in which he does not go to war with the great houses. But how can a defiant man accept that him dying (and all of his house) would mean a better world for the entire universe? He is blinded by revenge and cannot see anything beyond his own salvation. And this is exactly why the Bene Gesserit tried to eliminate his entire house, an action which was deemed to be unheard of in the past centuries. For the Emperor, it was simply because Leto Atreides was very appreciated by the other houses. It is interesting to see the Emperor had no idea why the Bene Gesserit green lit the Atreides extermination. But while the prophecy seeds were planted by the Bene Gesserit to help them, they end up being used against them. And the contingency plan of the Bene Gesserit (Feyd Rautha) against Paul fails too. The final fight between Feyd and Paul is again, a beautiful lesson on control (and who has it). While Feyd was the stronger and more skilled fighter, his flaws are also huge. One of them, cruelty. He injures Paul but instead of finishing the job quickly, he goes very close to Paul, to enjoy his victory. The sadist in Feyd wanted to see Paul in pain up close, to see him die. That's what Paul knew, what he saw, his only shot at victory. The narrow path. To accept a fight in which you'll very likely lose, just to get a shot to be very close to your opponent and use his flaws against him. The Bene Gesserit found out Feyds flaws also and planned to use them against him. Just like they tried with Paul (before the Great Reverend Mother was silenced by Paul she tried to command him as a motherly figure, as Paul was considered sensitive to strict maternal figures ordering him what to do, but to their surprise, control was completely lost, as Paul saw through their schemes).
So, all in all, the movie is well done, and while it does have a huge show with worms and explosions, the point of fundamentalism as a danger to civilization is quite well captured. 
I rarely give a 10/10, but the movie deserves it, even if it does not fully obey the books.",POSITIVE

"Mar 16, 2024","This movie is boring. And the visuals are not great. Why is everyone fawning over this repetitive sprawl of messiah cliches? There's nothing new or original here. Why in the year 10,000 do they still fight battles by running at each other with swords like it's the year 1000 BC,? The worms do nothing except dive in sand.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",Brilliant 👌🏾😊. Way better than part 1. This is a must see movie,POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",Entertaining but had some Issues. Overall seemed quite hurried. Introduced new villains unnecessarily and discarded villains from first movie after setting them up as intriguing and powerful. Eye candy tho filmed great. And pretty accurate to the book.,POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",We loved first movie and Dune 2 didn't disappoint!,POSITIVE

"Mar 16, 2024","I'm not a Dune fan just checked out the movies first and now second part based on the positive reviews. Just didn't do it for me. Not as much as the first part, but it is still dragged out. The story and setting is uninteresting and not much action. The cast was great for what the roles they were playing. I give them that.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 16, 2024","As someone who read the book and already enjoyed the first part very much, this is just utter perfection. Sure - it doesnt follow the book exactly, but the movie just leaves out details of the book and isnt trying to integrate any own ideas. It surpasses the first part, sets beautiful szenes, amazing fights and incredible music - and just gets the mood I got from the book aswell. Its a breathtaking movie, one of the best I have ever seen.",POSITIVE

The action, acting, and story were all top-notch, and the cinematography and special effects were stunning. The pacing was perfect, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. I particularly enjoyed the character development and how the relationships between them evolved over time. Overall, I highly recommend Dune Part Two to anyone who is looking for an unforgettable cinematic experience.",POSITIVE

"Mar 16, 2024",This movie leaves you feeling empty i really would have liked some type of conclusion for a two part movie.  I need a real ending probably won't go to see another sequel.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 16, 2024","A true modern masterpiece! This movie is perfect in every way, the casting and acting, the pace and editing, the sound mixing and score, photography, set pieces and costumes….it's just perfect. Everything about it is perfect! It is epic as Lawerence of Arabia. It is as well crafted as ‘Citizen Kane' or ‘The Godfather'. It is also as entertaining as ‘Jaws'. It is a perfection in cinema, and a continuation in craft.  
Its hard to say if dune 1 or 2 is better (i think they're both terrific), but Dune 2 is certainly a larger in scope, more magnificent in action and carrying with a bit more dialogue. Yet it maintains pace that makes it feel all too short. I get why the immediate reaction to Dune 2 surrounded the  rumors regarding Dune 3/ Messiah…we need more Dune!
The only drawbacks, as far as i can tell, is that it spoils every other movie for me. I find myself frustratingly scrolling through streaming apps looking for something ‘good' to watch lately, and I'm afraid Dune has spoiled everything for me…the bar for ‘good' movie has just been raised by Dune 2. 
As a final note I just want to thank Denis Villeneuve for making this movie, and WB and legendary pictures for funding it. As a long film fantatic, my heart feels more full knowing Dune exists in this modern world of entertainment",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","Great movie, action from start to end!",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",Loved the way the story was adapted.  The character development.  The score and cinematography was amazing.,POSITIVE

"Mar 16, 2024","O filme no começo me deu receio, ""Será que vai prestar"" mas depois os efeitos sonoros me impactou de um jeito que a cada som que reproduzia, me arrepiava. As cenas empolgante cheias de reviravoltas me deixou sair do cinema impactado. Parabéns aos responsáveis!",POSITIVE

"Mar 16, 2024","Absolutely amazing, everyone should go to the theatre whether you watched the 2021 movie or not",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",Perhaps the best sci-fi movie,POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",One the best movies of the year. Duna 2 and Joker probably fight in the next Oscar for the rewards,POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",How can one near perfect Dune movie be overshadowed? See Dune part II. Each part of the movie elevates from Dune I a step further.,POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",Great continuation of Part One.  This had some powerful moments from the cast.  Can't wait for Part 3 or Dune Messiah.,POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",A characters ascension to power is rarely handled with the level of finesse as it is here.,POSITIVE

"Mar 16, 2024","Eh um espetáculo de filme, incrível e vale cada centavo. Criaram um mundo totalmente novo, vc se vê lá dentro, a história eh mto bem amarrada, todos interligados, tem mocinha, tem bandido, tem história. Eh mta gente boa trabalhando, o Timothée está em sua melhor atuação sem sombra de dúvidas, se pintar com indicação ao Oscar, não será novidade. Javier Bardem (que não sou mto fã) está sensacional, a atuação e maquiagem do Skasgard são um show a parte, dá medo de ve-ló. Bautista mostrou q não sabe fazer apenas filmes de super heróis, mas pra mim, a maior surpresa fica por conta do Austin Butler, esse está sensacional e tem q estar no coadjuvante. A sempre competente Zendaya e a Rebeca Ferguson, mantém o nível lá no alto. 
Duna eh um show visual, sonoro e empolgante, ficou mto melhor que o primeiro e nos deixa ansiosos pelo segundo. Nota 10",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","It's worth watching in the cinema.
Impressive!",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","absolutely perfect, no notes.",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","Absolute Masterpiece!
Dennis Villeneuve is a true visionary for being able to project the book into this stunningly visual masterpiece that his peers have failed to do so. From stunt choreography to costumes, Villeneuve has done an excellent job at creating an entirely new world with its very own people and culture exactly as Frank Herbert intended it to be. This movie is a tribute to the novel for those who've read it. Nobody else has come this close to projecting it so perfectly and I don't think anyone else will in the near future",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","Good movie Critic and some fan reviews made it sound like it was the greatest movie of all time but definitely overhyped. I think the problem is we're so inundated with horrible movies these days, when a good decent movie comes along people think it's a masterpiece. It was definitely good but I'm most certainly not putting it in the masterpiece category.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 16, 2024",It's one of the deepest epics in all of humanities enlightened story telling.,POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","SO satisfying! Everything was perfect: the soundtrack, the scenery, the intensity of the characters and the plot.   I was totally entranced. This is what Dune looked like in my head when I read the book decades ago, and I am grateful to have gotten the chance to see it come to life.",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","I would say if you are a Dune fan, that the movie might be worth the watch, but for me it was really slow, a little confusing, not a lot of action and could have been way shorter for what it was. Lots of unnecessary stuff and missing stuff that could have made it more interesting.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","Is a really good movie and is the sequel that dune part one deserves. This movie in my opinion is better than the first one, it show us more about this world and the history behind it. The fight scenes are wild and epic. The photography is one of the best ones I have ever seen. The bad thing about it is that it is boring at some parts.",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","Dune 2 is a phenomenal movie. It is a conquest of cinema in its art, Direction, special effects, music, and more. This adaptation of the second half of Frank Herbert's first book, despite some changes, is masterful. Dune is the mother of them all. Its story was so far ahead of its time and it inspired Star Wars, The Terminator, and many, many other works of modern film and television. It was also socially ahead of its time and still relevant today as it warns of the cult of personality, and the Myth of Deification of Mortals. The acting is stellar. I heard Timothy Chalet was the weakest part, and that is, simply not true. He is much better than in the first and does a great job, subtly, transforming from boy Prince to Messianic soldier. The entire cast is brilliant. The film does a wonderful job picking up where the first one left off. Amazing Cinema.  As someone who loved the book and was so disappointed in the past by the versions released this was so satisfying.",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",Best 2024 movie by far!!!,POSITIVE

"Mar 16, 2024","Amazing action and visuals. Disney only dreams of being able to replicate it. I love that the narrative didn’t linger too long when unnecessary. For such a long series of source material I felt it really moved at the pace it needed to without feeling bogged down. This isn’t 10 episodes of game of thrones, it’s 5+ movies at a LOTR level, but the sci-fi everyone is craving. ",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",The greatest sci-fi movie of all time. Makes LOTR return of the king look mid af. On god fr fr,POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","This truly an experience that I have never seen from a sequel blockbuster in awhile. Top tier filmmaking, but also amazing performances from the cast. This is a very special sequel that must be experienced in the biggest screen.",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",Excellent second half of Dune. Close to the book in many ways but not weighed down with too much exposition.,POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",It was a fantastic movie. I will really recommend it so if they make another movie I would be delighted. If I am able to I would  watch it multiple times if I have the chance.,POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",Great Part 2 - hope we don't have to wait as long for part 3 😎,POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","I have seen and liked Villeneuve's part one, and really like David Lynch's version. I am a child of the 80s, so perhaps I'm just not the audience the producers were thinking of when casting.

In short, I was sadly underwhelmed. Slow, ponderous, antiseptic, too long, and, oh, BORING… 

While I like Chalamet, he is not right for the part, lacking the gravitas, looks or voice to make you believe he's a leader, let alone the messiah. He hasn't learned how to act yet. Yet.  Zendaya tries, but really doesn't have much to do.

While Lynch's version has its corny moments and isn't perfect, it had a definite edge, imparting a real sense of ""Evil"" and most of all — Javier Bardem aside — a sense of humour! So much more visually interesting despite FORTY YEAR OLD special effects.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","The movie is what a big budget movie should be. Music is fantastic, sound should win an award, and the visuals are stunning. Acting was top notch. I havent purchased a movie in a while. I will buy this one.",POSITIVE

"Mar 16, 2024","Even better than part 1, very exciting! I thought 3 hours might be long, but the last hour flew by!",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",The visuals were good. The plot didn't warrant the movie's length.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 16, 2024",wow part two is so good. This movie kept me gripped with the story and motivated to watch more. It is such a good a movie and 100 % recommend it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","Left the theater with my jaw on the floor. A+ performances all around (especially Butler), and some of the best cinematography I've seen. This blockbuster film stirred my soul more that any indie movie or arthouse film I've seen in years. This is spectacle done right. This is Herbert's work done justice. I can now say that Villeneuve's Dune is the sci-fi franchise of the century. (Oh, and one of Hans Zimmer's best scores.)",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",Probably one of the better movies I have seen in a while. I am literally going to go see it again.,POSITIVE

"Mar 16, 2024",Adequate but with some unfortunate changes.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",Nothing like the book or the original Dune movie.  Part 2 did nothing to make us want to go see a Part 3 if there is going to be one. Very disappointing!,NEGATIVE

"Mar 15, 2024",Very good movie if you like  syfy movies,POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2024",Nice visually but this second edition just noticeably skips through scenes that clearly don't match the story. Dune 2 feels very forced and muddled in the storyline and loses most of its pulling power. I became disengaged by hour 2. It's nice to watch but I wasn't impressed overall at how it was done. It's going to be difficult for the third movie to find a continuum when Dune 1 was spectacular and Dune 2 mediocre at best. Huge lost opportunity.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 15, 2024","Amazing movie! From the acting to the soundtrack to the cinematography, it was truly a work of art. The best movie I've seen since Part 1.",POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2024","Amazing IMAX Experience Greta effects, performances, just awesome. This is why we go to the movies!",POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2024","I saw Dune part 2 at an IMAX theater opening day. It was visually impressive, but I didn't like the pacing/editing. Long glances and intense eye contact took up a lot of the almost 3-hour movie. The Paul/sandworm scene was great, but the battle scenes overall were not that impressive. I also couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. There was a disconnect for me.

I think I was more impressed by the trailer than the actual movie. I was looking forward to Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha, but it was underwhelming when I saw the movie. His character depiction felt forced and almost cartoonish. At least he looked scary. Another Dune cast member, Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh in ""No Country for Old Men"" was more chilling/ unnerving.  

Tim and Zendaya were okay, but I didn't see this amazing chemistry that some people keep going on and on about. It's not their fault. I think it has more to do with what they were given and Denis' direction. Christopher Walken was a miscast. 

The sound, makeup, costumes, cinematography, and overall technical aspects of the movie were the highlights for me.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 15, 2024",If you go see it in 4DX. It will blow your socks off. It’s really fun.,POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2024",Definitely up there with the greatest movies to see in theaters.,POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2024",Fantastic from start to finish. This movie deserves the lord of the rings and original star wars comparisons. I wish it was longer. That final battle scene could have lasted an extra 45 minutes and I wouldn't have complained at all.,POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2024","Denis Villeneuve crafted an excellent sequel to an incredible part one. The visuals are undeniable and the cinematography are a shoo-in for Oscar nominations. However, The first half of this film does suffer some pacing issues and the number of new characters is hard to manage. Overall, Chalamet certainly commands his role, but he benefits from powerful performances in Bardem and Butler. Compared to other god-tier sequels, this is not better than Two Towers or Empire Strikes Back. But, it is on par with the Dark Knight or Finding Dory.",POSITIVE

"Mar 15, 2024",Pretty faithful to the book.  Loved it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2024",I actually really enjoyed the film. I read the books and I dont think Denis should have cut out the scenes he mentioned he had to. It could have been a four hour movie because I wanted more after it was done.,POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2024",Generally well directed but could easily have been trimmed down by 40 mins. The central character unfortunately doesn't project the Messiah warrior vibe. Too much of a school boy.,NEUTRAL

"Mar 15, 2024","Plot driven and visually stunning, Dune pt. 2 proves a gritty and satisfying second installment to what will surely be a trilogy to remember. A violent work of art, Denis Villenueve provides perhaps too many scenes where you squirm in your seat. In the end, marvelously choreographed fights, another top-class score from Hans Zimmer, and thrilling performances from Timothee Chalamet and Austin Butler make for an outstanding film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2024",So wonderful I went twice to watch the movie and I love it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2024",Spectacular and mesmerizing!,POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2024","One of the most beautiful and epic movies I've ever seen. Every scene felt like its own piece of art. If Greig Fraser doesn't win for cinematography it will be an absolute crime. It literally took my breath away multiple times. You must see it in IMAX if at all possible. Envelop yourself in it.

Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is a triumph. Both ancient and futuristic, tribal and modern, softly soulful and body-shakingly epic.

And of course the story… it belongs up there with the greatest sci-fi stories of all time. Every actor put their entire being into their performances. Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Timothée Chalamet, Stellan Skarsgård, Austin Butler, Javier Bardem…wow, just wow.

Completely exceeded my expectations. This movie will go down as one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time.",POSITIVE

"Mar 15, 2024","Super suite respectueuse de l'œuvre de Frank Herbert! Les fans des livres devraient s'y retrouver malgré les quelques choix narratifs qui sont toujours à faire pour adapter un livre au cinéma. Les fans du film de Lynch de 1984 devraient aussi s'y retrouver même si la fin n'est évidemment pas la même, en effet ce Dune Partie 2 est sur une fin ouverte (pour une suite) et en un sens, bien plus pessimiste que celui de Lynch qui se voulait très clairement être un one shot! Les scènes de batailles sont épique à souhait et on voit bien que Villeneuve aime toujours les beau plan qui montre le gigantisme du monde autour de ses tout petits personnages ! Arrakis est splendide! Les scènes de combat sont bien chorégraphiées mais le réalisateur n'a jamais été un grand cinéaste de scène d'action! Au plus le film avance, au plus on en demande, Thimothee Chalamet est terrifiant dans son rôle de Paul Usul Muad Dib et malgré le fait que le film soit particulièrement sérieux, les petites touches de légèreté amenées par Stilgard, le personnage de Javier Barden sont les très bien venues. Je pourrais encore parler des heures de ce film que j'ai quand même particulièrement adoré je conseille à tous d'aller le voir (particulièrement en IMAX!)",POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2024","Part One was great but Part Two was simply perfect. Everything from the VFX and costume design to the acting and choreography was just satisfying, to say the least. The cinematography really had me immersed in the setting of Ararrakis, and the greater Dune universe. Not only was it a great viewing experience in IMAX, but the narrative and characters stayed respectful to the original novel. A must see film for any fans of sci-fi and anyone in general.",POSITIVE
"Mar 15, 2024","This movie was dark, ugly, and about wicked people doing violent graffic things. My whole family hated it. This should have been rated R. I felt tricked thinking that this was a family movie. It is not. I saw quite a few moms get up and walk out. I wish I had too. So what if the acting is good and the visuals were good. The message left me demoralized. There are so many fabulous sci-fi movies that could be made. Do we really need a movie about child molesters and human organ eaters? It starts bleak and ends bleak. 0 stars if I could. Humans should make something worthy to see. This was not worthy material to adapt. I wish that I'd walked out too. And shame on the people who rate movies who called this pg13.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 15, 2024","The film promised too much for a war that only lasted about 2 minutes on screen, the sound is incredible, the soundtrack is to be congratulated, but the film has an excess of disposable scenes and is quite repetitive.

"Mar 15, 2024","A truly breathtaking cinematic experience. As a huge fan of the Dune books and universe, this is a spectacular adaptation that builds on part one beautifully in every way.

"Mar 15, 2024","Dune 2 brings back epic Hollywood moviemaking. 

The vastness of the journey, and the artistic and luscious visuals of Dune 2s photography is reminiscent of old Hollywood movie days. 

Movies like this come around once every few decades, a must see in every level.

The music is moving, enhancing scenes that burn into the senses. 

The story is fluid, and told well.  The actors really play each role to its fullest, I was super impressed.

This is the same director from ""Blade Runner 2049"" and that's a good thing. His direction and vision of the future is creative and pure eye candy for the audience.",POSITIVE

"Mar 15, 2024","If you have read the books, then you will likely love this movie, because there are a lot of connections that you can make and it brings the books nicely to life. If you haven't read the books, then there is little in the way of narrative to provide the necessary detail to some of the things that happen in the movie. So for someone who's not read the books, it feels like we're just jumping from one big theme to the next, with some great visuals and spectacle in-between, but we don't understand the how or why, which makes for some very surprising parts that feel weirdly disjointed. Also, the sound editing continues to be a problem as it was in the first movie.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 15, 2024","I can't say 5 stars because I'm a big fan of the books, especially the ones this movie is based on. 

The changes are not something that make the source material better. 

However, the visuals are great, and it's not a politically charged film. Worth the watch.

I will say that the Audio book, the new one, is amazing and better than this for are so you should get it to see what I mean about the changes

Paul is a lot more put together in the book. So is the other main character. 

Also there's a lot of yelling and way too much religious music and made up languages

Tldr; get the audio book
Not bad considering the trash that has been out for that last year, good enough but not great

Won't rewatch but would re listen to 21 hours of audio",POSITIVE

"Mar 15, 2024","Dune: Part Two may just be one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. The worldbuilding is deep and intricate, the plot is complex and engaging, the characters are both compelling and interesting. The acting is top notch, and the visual effects are spectacular. While part one was mostly setup (albeit very good setup), this movie contains the majority of the plot of Dune. While it's only March as of this writing, I think there's a very high chance that Dune: Part Two will be the best movie of 2024.",POSITIVE

Has a great plot and some exceptional follow through with ideas. The great acting from the majority of the main cast.  Just enough action and story line all tied in together for an entertaining 2hr and 47 min. Top it all off with a massive climax at the end of the film that will having you beg for a third installment.  This is a definitely must see and I give it 2 thumbs and a big toe up.,POSITIVE
"Mar 14, 2024","""Dune: Part Two"" emerges as a monumental cinematic achievement, epitomizing the word ""epic"" in every frame. Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides reaches new heights of excellence, showcasing a depth and complexity that captivates from start to finish. However, it's Austin Butler who steals scenes effortlessly, shedding his Elvis persona to fully embody the menacing yet charismatic Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen. Despite its substantial runtime of almost 3 hours, the film's masterful storytelling keeps audiences engrossed, ensuring that every minute is worth the journey. Drawing inspiration from classics like ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Dune: Part Two"" is a testament to visionary filmmaking at its finest.

Director Denis Villeneuve's meticulous attention to detail shines through, crafting a visually stunning and emotionally resonant experience that transcends the sci-fi genre. With a gripping narrative that balances personal dilemmas with cosmic stakes, the film explores themes of love, destiny, and sacrifice against the backdrop of a richly realized universe. As Paul Atreides navigates the treacherous sands of Arrakis, grappling with the weight of his choices, audiences are swept up in a cinematic spectacle that lingers long after the credits roll. ""Dune: Part Two"" cements itself as a modern masterpiece, setting a new standard for blockbuster filmmaking while honoring the timeless allure of Frank Herbert's literary saga.",POSITIVE
"Mar 14, 2024","Visually stunning and the definition of epic in story, landscape and character development!",POSITIVE
"Mar 14, 2024",This movie is absolutely perfect. Loved the cast and the cinematography is next level. Some stunning scenes in this film.,POSITIVE
"Mar 14, 2024","*Contains spoilers* Dune Part One was amazing, I watched it at least 10 times. So, my expectation for Part Two was sky high and now, having watched it 4 times on IMAX, I was just blown away every single time I watched it and I am still thinking about it, appreciating it. People are hailing this movie as the Series of our generation, and I can see why. Part Two is so ambitious, juggling multiple threads, introducing new characters, and setting up set pieces - it all comes together in glorious balance. While the action is breath-taking, the visuals dazzling, the score out of this world - it is ultimately the love between Paul and Chani, and the idea of a Messiah, and its religious undertones that make this movie one of the best, if not the best I've watched. Should any faction embrace the idea of a Messiah, should one step into that role if you have a choice, no matter how good your intentions are, would it have the power to corrupt, and how does this affect people closest to you are all questions that director, Denis Villeneuve challenges us to ponder. We experience all these not just from the protagonist perspective, but Chani. We see her playing that angel on Paul's shoulder, and through her eyes, we see Paul's transformation, perhaps not for the better. Denis said in one of his interviews, that Frank Herbert never intended Paul to be hailed as a hero, and this transformation is paying homage to that. Is he slowly turning into the very people he hates (he has the bloodline!), and with every glare and icy stare from Chani, and Hans Zimmer's fantastic score that alternates between hopeful and dark, we start to question that. All these decisions which are different than the books, elevate the story to another level. Movies are a visual storytelling  medium and how Denis played off the feelings of different characters to make the audience feel torn about what's right or wrong - is just brilliant film-making. And of course the action is just LOTR-level epic. The harvester attack, the ornithopter attack, the sandworm riding, the battle of the Arrakeen are all shot and choreographed beautifully. The cinematography, well it was award winning and Denis had a lot of ""iconic shots"" in the movie, these are just snapshots that stays in your mind and just looks friggin cool, like Paul running on that mound towards the sandworm, Paul and Chani's first kiss, Paul shouting Long Live the Fighters with his cape flowing behind him, Stilgar crouched waiting for the Battle to begin, the 3 sandworms in the screen ready to attack the Sardaukar - just too many to list here. Hans Zimmer also goes apeshit on this one with industrial clangs, guitars, throaty sounds and that all too famous ""waaaa-ah-ah-aaaah-ahhhhh"". I mean, he got his team to create instruments because ""they wouldn't have pianos in planets in the future"".  Dune is that special project that everybody pours their heart into, and we the audience see it on the screen and feel it in our hearts. One movie critic once said ""the greatness of a movie is measured with how long you were thinking about the movie once you left the cinema"" - I love that quote and I can say, I am still thinking about the masterpiece I watched and still reading the stories of the Mahdi and the lore of Dune. This is a movie of epic proportions, watch it on IMAX the way Denis intended it to be experienced, it will change your life.",POSITIVE
"Mar 14, 2024","As I see it, this part 2 is a huge upgrade compared to the first one which acts as an Introduction to the universe and characters. This film is really enjoyable with an amazing soundtrack and beautiful scenes. The pacing is good overall throughout the movie. However, in the last part of the movie, it all felt a bit rushed so everything fits. Moreover, nothing bad to say about the acting, I am looking forward the part 3.",POSITIVE
"Mar 14, 2024","One of the best sequels ever made. It makes Part one a better movie. The main complaint with the first movie was that it was slow moving. Part two was so action packed,  that now Part one was no longer A slow movie, it was A great character building movie. Part two was so good that it makes part one better. We don't get to see that often. The age we live in now, more often good movies are ruined by their sequels (see; ""Terminator Dark Fate"" making ""T2"" completely irrelevant.) Or we have good shows ruined by their final season (see; Game of Thrones.) Dune Part 2 is something great, and something very rare in modern day Hollywood.",POSITIVE

"Mar 14, 2024","The pace was slow. The content and context presented felt empty. It would appear as if they took one movie and are trying to spread the content over three installments. After seeing the first dune many years ago, although I've never read the book, I am disappointed and wish I hadn't taken the time to see this part 2.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 14, 2024","Honest review is the film is visually stunning. If you're a visual person, you'll love it. But its exceeding long winded with too many slow dull sequences. The story telling is weak. You never have any doubt or tension of any kind. Completely predictable from start to finish. I couldn't sit through it twice which is my benchmark for a great film.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 14, 2024","Despite its long runtime the film never really feels like it has dead space in it. The visuals are extraordinary, going way beyond any Marvel movie in quality and the sense of what you're watching doesn't exist in some universe. The first film was a turnoff for some, and this would be to those as well for the same reasons, but for me, I love the pacing and grand imagery of Denis Villeneuve's style. Shots give you a sense of the world and contrast between being  intimate and keeping you aware of the size of the world he has created. So far, the best movie of the last year in its genre. As a sequel, it delivers in keeping up with the first installment, lacking the falloff franchises like The Matrix suffered from. It's unclear whether or not there will be a third from the way it ends but either way I am satisfied with how the story progressed and wrapped up.",POSITIVE
"Mar 14, 2024",This movie was excellent. Pacing was great. The development of Paul's character is painful and scary to watch and the deep religious aspects of the film really make it feel heavy. I can't wait to see it again.,POSITIVE
"Mar 14, 2024",THIS is the Dune movie I have been waiting for!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 14, 2024","Dune: Part Two is the face of pure masterful cinema. Like part one, part two feels as though they had to actually go to Arrakis (dune) to film. My complaints about the film are so minor and get completely shadowed by the sheer scale of the movie. This to me is a 10/10 without a question. You must see it in IMAX to truly experience its dessert power.",POSITIVE
"Mar 14, 2024",one word: masterpiece!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 14, 2024","As I watched this film, I was completely immersed in the world Arrakis. With a captivating soundtrack and the expert use of lighting and color, I could not leave the universe I was placed in, even in thought, for the entire 2 hours and 45 minutes. I feel that the story was perfectly showcased in the way the characters were designed, the way they interacted with one another, the way each setting was designed, and the pacing of the story throughout the whole film. Watching this felt like I was reading the book. The relationship between Frank Herbert's 1964 novel and this movie adaptation is stronger than any other book to movie relationship I have ever seen. Nearly everything is the same and is presented accurately, with only one major difference taking place at the very end of the movie. Finally, the cinematography (especially of every battle and fight scene) had my friends and I in awe. Dune: Part Two is a must see for 2024 and will be for all the years to come.",POSITIVE

I was expecting more of the same with different visuals.  Nothing prepared me for what I experienced.  Talented rewrite with superb direction and editing.  Old became new and unexpected.  I look forward to the next installment - Part III.",POSITIVE
"Mar 14, 2024","Part one was fantastic and held true to the source material. Part two started in that vein, but wildly departed post Paul water of life. The movie should have ended there, with a promise of a part three.
Instead Paul became a jackass, loses the love and respect of Chani, Arya remains in utero, the great houses don't capitulate, and the Fremen holy war begins.
All in the final reel.

The baron limped through the story line and was barely watchable. the film relied way too much on cgi, the battle scenes did not hold true. at least for me The emperor was irrelevant and didn't seem like a force to be reckoned with. Maybe I was holding on to the original film score and didn't give this much of a chance.  I'll try this again when the cinema is not so packed and people constantly getting up in front of the screen due to the length of the film",NEUTRAL
"Mar 13, 2024","Great movie overall. Could have used a bit better editing as some parts are a little disjointed and choppy, especially if you're not familiar with the books. Length is also a bit long. Could have used a bit of physical aging of the characters to support the concept of growing from boy to man over time as the story would have actually taken quite an extended amount of time to have taken place. With that in mind, Paul's sister should have been born before the end of the movie as this storyline must have taken more than a few months to have really transpired.

I am a HUGE sci-fi fan, love movies by Denis Villeneuve and was excitedly looking forward to seeing Dune II after seeing the GLOWING reviews and ratings on RT.  Unfortunately...I was greatly disappointed and couldn't wait for the film to end.  It was, indeed, a spectacle.  There was no end to the dazzling sets, costumes special effects and grandious dramatic music. But overall I found it to be pretentious and melodramatic.  It seemed as if Villeneuve skimped on the compelling storytelling and assumed if he just threw a bunch of impressive-looking stuff up on the sceen that we'd all be ""awed"" into thinking Dune II was an epic masterpiece. I don't think it was. I never cared about any of the characters except for Chani. I never believed these were realistic people facing realistic problems. In fact, the characters often did things that seemed quite nonsensical. I understand that the film is an adaptation from a novel so Villeneuve was restricted by the source text, but he didn't seem to put any effort into drawing the viewer into the world of Dune and making it seem like a real, lived-in universe. It seemed like just a bunch of eye (and ear) candy splashed across the screen to subjugate the audience and make us all nod our heads and proselytize about it's grand prescence.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 13, 2024","A movie where the Paul Atredies goes on a journey growing from a boy to leader to fulfill his destiny. lots of characters and plots being built for the next installment but oh boy This movie is it .It has it all you would and wouldn't expect it's very immersive as it has a crazy good cinematography where you dive into this world and forget about our reality ,it has an amazing soundtrack keeping you on the edge of your seat and it's executed really good to match with scenes.Also the crazy plot taking us to different places and set pieces.the movie gives us intense scenes  leaving you mind blown.All in all, Incredible movie  that sets a new benchmark for sci fi movies and gives the viewer an elite movie experience. highly recommended!!❤️",POSITIVE

"Mar 13, 2024",Hollywood got something right for a change.  Enjoyed it!,NEUTRAL
"Mar 13, 2024","I think it might be a bit unfair to compare this adaptation to the book - though it's hard to separate them completely. While the book is better, to be sure, this film takes certain creative liberties that I found enjoyable, once I let the movie stand on its own, apart from my preconceived notions from the book. 

It's a bummer how Jessica was portrayed as a surface level villain, her character I found to be much more nuanced in the book, perhaps more admirable in comparison. One of the bigger bummers imo. Chani was muchhh improved though; they gave her way more agency, with a less devestating arc. 

Maybe my hottest take: I did not like the score. In fact, that may have been the biggest disappointments for me. Dune's score has almost no leitmotifs, recurring musical phrases that represent characters and themes. There were certain scenes that were so grandiose and impactful visually but lacked a through line with the music. There were many pretty musical moments to be sure, but with only a couple recognizable melodies that occurred more than once, I found it difficult to get fully sucked into the film. With Hans Zimmer writing the score, I was surprised to be let down. 

A return to the sterile sci fi of 2001 a Space Odyssey was super cool and enjoyable to me, some really beautiful shots.
But why the heck were there no stars?????
Like, is the desert, known for brilliant night skies, and they mention constellations in the movie, so why the heck do we not get a beautiful night sky shots of the stars?? Huge let down. 

Because of all the changes from the book, I'm super curious as to how they're going to tackle the third movie and finish Paul's story from the books. Perhaps this final movie will create a solid through line between all the movies that improves the overall storytelling and world building. 

Also another hot take, the Baron in this movie was kind of a meh villain, could have been way better, let down imo as well.
But Austin Butler really killed it for sure. And Timothee was a perfect Paul, Zendaya was a brilliant Chani as well. V solid casting for these three character, their performances really shone through and sold the story.",POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024",Remarkable storytelling and an exhilarating visual spectacle that delivered a very fulfilling conclusion to Part One.,POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024","From the books to this 2nd live adaptation, Dennis, the crew, and the cast have raised the bar in terms of visuals, scale, and musical score. I would highly recommend viewing the movie in IMAX if possible. Great movie 🍿",POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024","A Grand Spectacle: Dune 2 Solidifies Itself as a Modern Masterpiece

Dune: Part Two isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic experience that demands to be seen on the big screen. Director Denis Villeneuve crafts a visually stunning and emotionally resonant follow-up to the 2021 film, solidifying its place as a modern masterpiece.

A Feast for the Senses: The film boasts breathtaking visuals. From the vast, desolate landscapes of Arrakis to the intricate details of the Fremen culture, every frame is a testament to the exceptional production design and special effects. The score by Hans Zimmer further elevates the experience, perfectly complementing the on-screen action and heightening the emotional core of the story.

Powerhouse Performances: The cast delivers exceptional performances. Timothée Chalamet embodies the troubled hero, Paul Atreides, with a captivating intensity. Zendaya shines as Chani, bringing depth and nuance to her role. The supporting cast, including Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem, is equally impressive, adding further weight to the narrative.

A Story that Captivates: Dune 2 delves deeper into the complex themes of Frank Herbert's source material. It explores the consequences of unchecked ambition, the seductive nature of power, and the struggle for survival in a harsh environment. While the film's lengthy runtime might test some viewers' patience,  the narrative rewards those who stay invested.

A Must-See on the Big Screen: Dune: Part Two is a film that begs to be revisited. The combination of stunning visuals, powerful performances, and a thought-provoking storyline makes it a truly exceptional cinematic achievement. 

In short:
Visually breathtaking 
Powerful score by Hans Zimmer
Exceptional performances by the entire cast
Complex and thought-provoking story 
A cinematic experience best enjoyed on the big screen 

Recommendation: Dune: Part Two is a strong contender for a must-watch film, especially for fans of science fiction epics and those seeking a visually stunning and narratively rich experience.",POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024",Great acting and story. The cinematography was excellent along with special effects.,POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024",Easily the best movie I have seen in the last 10 years. I absolutely loved it. Still have goosebumps 15 min after it ended. This needs to be seen on an IMAX theater or the biggest screen you can find.,POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024","A cinematic masterpiece, for any sci-fi lovers out there",POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024","The north-south Fremen religious differences were an unnecessary and contrived difference between the book and the screenplay.  Chani's character was done an injustice as a result in addition to no longer being Dr. Liet Kynes daughter.

Paul and Chani's son Leto not born and dying in the sitch attack, Alia (Paul's sister) not being born to end the life of her grandfather (Baron Harkonnen) leaves too many holes to fill by fabrication to conclude the book in a Part 3.  The story is fiction and does not require peoples abilities (Alia's in particular) to be grounded in reality.

The film locations chosen for Dune were fabulous.  The CGI and other effects are the high points of this interpretation of Frank Herbert's Dune.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 13, 2024","Because I know the story already, I found the movie to be thoroughly intriguing and entertaining.  The acting is terrific.  It is truly a Sci-Fi marvel of a movie.  People who don't know the story will be disappointed with the ending because it's not really an ending at all: it's dangling arcs that didn't finish.  Terrific if there is a 3rd movie.  Not so terrific if there isn't.",POSITIVE

"Mar 13, 2024","I didn't love Dune, but part two is head and shoulders above. The cinematography, the action, The music are all great. For me it really picked up in the second half once Feyd - Austin Butler - showed up. He is so gleefully evil and commands the screen. You just can't take your eyes off him!",POSITIVE

"Mar 13, 2024","It's better than the majority of the movies that are made. Better than the 84 Dune for sure. I wouldn't say it's the best movie ever though. I have Dune on an incredibly high pedestal because of the book. There are minor issues I have with the movie. Otherwise though, it's a definite must watch in the theater. Especially in Imax.",POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024","How many battle scenes do we need to understand the prowess of these filmmakers? Are Timmy and Zendaya really believable as The One and The Love of His Life, (especially after he casts her off so cavalierly for the chain-mailed daughter of Emperor Chris Walken)? Perhaps the writers, producers and directors should go back to film school to relearn how to tell an effective narrative in an hour and a half. Its been done before and Im sure these stars can put their egos aside long enough to craft a film that is both engaging, swiftly told and not so long on the effects. I mean, how many sand worms can we ride and Harkonnens can we kill before it just gets too boring? 
Ps. The seats shaking and noises around the viewers head was a fun gimmick, just that, a gimmick.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 13, 2024","Visual effects and costuming remain the strongest features of the film. The plot seemed a bit disjointed and rushed at times, which is understandable considering the length of the source material. 

Jessica,  and most regrettably, Paul are no longer sympathetic characters- to the point they start to feel like the villains. By the end I wasnt rooting for anyone to win.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 13, 2024","This movie is a great continuation of the prequel, and it's a film that everyone should watch. Almost everything about the movie is at it's best. The movie is long, which I think is good, cause it's a massive story. The story is exciting and great from the start till the finish. The movie also has good graphics in it, and it feels like pure natural art. The music is absolutely amazing, I believe this is one of the best works of Hans Zimmer and his team. All the actors have done a great job when it comes to acting, cause everything felt so real, as if the events were happening for real. The movie lacks emotionality, which I think is not an issue, but I'm hoping that Dune Part 3 will be emotional. At the end, I really loved Dune 2, and I'm very excited for Dune 3 whenever it comes out. I believe that Dune 3 will more epic, exciting and amazing than what we've seen in Dune 2. It's my request for everyone to go and watch Dune 2, cause it's epic, awesome, great, amazing and still so much more to praise.",POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024","Movie was ok, but not worth watching again. It added too much meaningless detail to the story and departed too much from expectations of the story from the first movie Dune (no weirding module). It was also unbelievable at times which detracts. (Too much sword fighting in an era of space travel and guns).",NEUTRAL

"Mar 13, 2024","I had high hopes after the first part was quite faithful and infused with new directors take. But this part 2 misses the mark story wise. Visually as strikin

"Mar 13, 2024","Music: Amazing, Effects: Gorgeous, Story: Nonsensical. There are so many plot holes it feels like the sandworms ate most of it. Don't get how the reviews for a movie that requires you to read a book first to understand certain points is so praised.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 13, 2024",Spectacular and touching at the same time fantastic movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024","A typical Villeneuve Movie. And thats a big compliment. Villeneuve has retained everything that made the first part so special.
The action scenes are rare, but when they happen, they are epic, technically implemented at the highest level and thrilling.
What once again sets Villeneuve's film apart from other blockbusters is the visual story telling. I don't need everything explained. Villeneuve certainly trusts his viewers to draw the necessary conclusions from what they see.
The acting is outstanding, let's exclude Christopher Walken, who in my opinion could have improved his voice acting. My highlight was the performance of Austin Butler.
The only downside is that the criticism of religion shown in the books has been somewhat lost.
But it's still an amazing movie. I want part three.",POSITIVE

"Mar 13, 2024","It's big, it's loud, it's got giant worms used for mass passenger and freight transport. (The film does NOT show their boarding process.) It's got too many well-known actors, which is distracting - you keep seeing them as themselves rather than the characters they're playing. The villains are cartoonishly evil. It's way too long.

But it's Dune. If you liked the first one, you'll probably like this more.",POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024","Absolutely incredible movie - a must-see in the cinema on the big screen. The entire cast is amazing and the images are stunning. After watching it in the cinema, it is now in my top-10 movies of all time. Incredible movie.",POSITIVE

Thank you Denis Villeneuve for this amazing adaptation.",POSITIVE

"Mar 12, 2024","Somewhat disappointed. The first film was an epic 10/10 bringing many of the subtleties of the book to life, whilst visually stunning Part 2 just gets it wrong. The Chani character is the main problem, spends half the time 'acting' like a bloke and all the rest of the time scowling. Just bad acting, which is a shame as it doesn't fit the story or in any way add to it. Meanwhile Javier Bardem plays a nodding dog and the score is pretty poor... Islamic wailing for 3 hours basically. It's a bit odd as the score and all acting performances were exemplary in the first movie. So the Muad'dib tries to lead and rally his troops whilst his girlfriend clearly thinks he's a right bellend. Rather than it being a bit tragic when he agrees to marry the Emperor's daughter instead you get the impression he is well rid of her and has actually got a decent lass. Some truly memorable moments when Chani isn't in shot but they are a bit brief and the aesthetics are all wrong. So whilst the 80s version had incredibly hammy acting in the first half and became rather epic in the second, the modern adaptation had an almost perfect first half and then quite a poor second. Still worth a watch if you're a fan of the books.",NEGATIVE

I absolutely loved when Anakin Skywalker came on screen with Paul Atriedes and said, ""Together we are Dune part 2"" before hugging emotionally. And the 8 hour scene with the sandworms and the hulk was absolutely amazing. My only complaint is that Sherman and Mr. Peabody only appear for 10 scenes instead of the whole movie. Did I mention how much I love Sherman and Mr. Peabody? I really loved the scene where Atriedes said, ""You turned her against me"" to Perry the Platypus from Phineas and Ferb, and when  Anakin Skywalker said, ""SILENCE!"" to Mama Coco.

"Mar 12, 2024","An amazing film, not a dull moment in a film which is over 2 1/2 hours. Never has a sparse, desert scenery been so captivating. Honestly do not think I will see a better film this year.",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","From the cinematography, to the writing, to the soundtrack and dialogue, the movie is perfect.",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","As a book adaptation it's probably around 75% accurate, but as a standalone film it's a masterpiece. Some characters and events diverge from the source material, but the overall message remains intact. Beautiful movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",It sucked. Too disjointed and too long. The acting was a discredit to the cast. Also a drug out movie that would have only been half as long.  Didnt even come close to the hype on cinematogphy.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",I already liked the first part; but this one exceeds its predecessor and I am happy about it. Can't wait to see Dune: Messiah.,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",The perfect sci-fi / fantasy movie doesn’t exis—… Go see this thing on the biggest screen possible with bonkers loud speakers. Thank me later. ,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",ABSOLUTE MUST SEE ONLY ON THE IMAX SCREEN,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","I provided everything I could ask of the story. More action than Dune1 but the sound and special effects are awesome.
I took the wife to the cinema to see it and she hated it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Before watching Dune II, I wanted to see ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962). The sand, the heavy burden of ""predestination"" which the main character rejects, politics and blood - there are a lot of similarities between these two epic canvas of cinematography.

But back to the main thing, ""Dune II"" is a terrifying tape, it's been three days since the first show, a day later I watched it one more time and it still won't let it go. Thanks to the talent of director Denis Villeneuve, the theme of the formation of the dark side of the personality of Paul Atreides is fascinating and terrifying. The scale of events and the sacrifices that religious fanaticism and worship of a charismatic leader bring with them break out in a cold sweat after watching.

This is a ""smart"" movie wrapped in a spectacular blockbuster. Honestly, on the second viewing, I felt more, perhaps because the first viewing had set expectations for the film. I just couldn't keep up with the pace of the film; there was many times more action and fewer words and breaks. By the end of the movie, even the great ""desert makers"" (sandworms) were so tired that I wondered how I would leave the cinema today by taxi and not by shaikhulud.

But we must give credit, from the perspective of the film's language, this is a magnificent creation. The sound and image here triumph, the action scenes are ""Shut up and take my money!""

Give me even more panoramic shots by Greg Fraser, shots from above and sweet Muad'Dib (I'm referring to jerboa now, not Timothee Chalomet), and I'll remain on Arakis forever.

 Although it would be possible to remain longer at Giedi Prime, black-and-white firework effects are one of the most impactful impressions. The whole black-and white history of the Harkonnens' planet, from a psychological perspective, abruptly conveys their House's worldview, visually perfected: style, restraint, smoothness, and beauty.

In Part 2 of Dune, the director brings forward female characters and the mechanism of the formation of a religious cult. The eyes of Rebecca Ferguson (Paul's mother and now the Reverend Mother) are the most alive. The character of Zendai, played by Chani, is Paul's personal doubts and fears about his role as a religious leader, the prophet of the Fremen. This whole role is built on one frown. Overall, the love story is just plain cardboard, there was more electricity between Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer in ""Call Me by Your Name"" than between two young Hollywood stars.

It feels like Denis has put all his love into one character, giving the soul of the film to him. Although there might not be much, every appearance is worth it. And I'm talking about embodiments of fear and hatred on Aracis, the assassin-mercenary Feyd-Routh played by Austin Butler. It's powerful and sexy, and everything is monochrome. The danger oozes from the screen through the tip of his knife. 

Compared to such a charismatic villain, even Timothee Chalamet seems lost. Fortunately, he has a powerful scene near the end of the film, where he delivers an amazing speech in Fremeni, in the spirit of ""The King."" The speech is not just a boy, but a man. He is exactly in his place, carrying the cross of ""starboy,"" as his hero, he still needs to act 3 to fully sing his song. Without ""Messiah,"" there is no end to Paul Atreides' story. All the plot points are there. 

""You will come. There is only desert for you"" (Lawrence of Arabia).",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","This is my favorite movie of all time. The music, the story, the acting, the cinematography, the music, everything is just perfect",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","This is a must-see. Prepare to be captivated! True storytelling at its best. I loved the darker tones this film had compared to Dune: Part One. The atmosphere is so immersive, and the cinematography was amazing. I was drawn in from the very beginning. The stellar cast delivered nothing short of brilliance, bringing their characters to life with fantastic performances. From start to finish, it's an epic adventure that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. Be sure to watch it on the biggest screen you can for the best experience! Highly recommend, this is one movie you won't want to miss in theaters!",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",Excellent visual and storyline. One of the best sci-fi movies of all time. I loved it!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",this movie was absolutely spectacular. I watched it 2 days ago and i cannot stop talking about it. Everybody did a amazing job and i most definitely and going to see it again. just amazing,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","One of the greatest sci-fi movies, the soundtrack gave me goosebumps! awesome",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Part 2 is the one of the best movies I've ever watched. The visuals matched with great acting plus an astonishing soundtrack just hit it for me. Got goosebumps multiple times. I love that they took the time to make a meaningful movie, and didn't rush it. 

If you can watch it in IMAX or the biggest scene and with great speakers to get the best experience, or at least that's what worked for me. 5/5 stars. WOW. INCREDIBLE!",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","This movie was fantastic! Definitely a must see for sci fi fans. The visuals were stunning, the characters were strong, and the theme was sound. Gravity and high stakes were conveyed in scenes without a whole lot of gore, which I found impressive. The plot and political tensions were also not too difficult to follow once invested.  My only critique was that the movie felt a squeak long. Nonetheless, would highly recommend and watch again!",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Dune Part One dient als ein fesselnder Prolog zu einem epischen Abenteuer, der uns nicht nur in eine faszinierende Welt einführt, sondern auch die komplexen Hintergründe und die Ausgangslage darlegt. Dune Part Two bricht jedoch mit Konventionen und präsentiert uns einen Helden, dessen Anfangsintentionen wir nicht nur verstehen, sondern auch leidenschaftlich unterstützen. Auf seiner heroischen Reise gewinnt er von Moment zu Moment an Stärke und Macht. Wir, als Zuschauer*innen, fühlen uns eng mit ihm verbunden und fiebern jedem seiner Siege entgegen.

Doch auf dem Zenit seiner Macht konfrontiert uns der Film mit einer moralischen Zerrissenheit. Der Held, einst unser Leuchtfeuer der Hoffnung, wird durch Manipulationen und die schwindende Empathie in ein fragwürdiges Licht gerückt. Diese Wendung zwingt uns zum Innehalten und Nachdenken. Unsere Unterstützung bleibt stark, doch sind wir nun angehalten, seine Beweggründe kritisch zu hinterfragen. Es entsteht eine innere Spannung zwischen der Sehnsucht nach seinem Triumph und der Furcht vor den Antworten, die wir finden könnten.

Dune Part Two ist in seiner Tiefe und Komplexität das Empire Strikes Back unserer Generation – ein filmisches Meisterwerk, das in seiner emotionalen und philosophischen Tragweite beeindruckt. Ein Werk, das nicht nur auf der Leinwand, sondern auch im Herzen des Publikums eine unauslöschliche Spur hinterlässt. Ein absolutes Muss für jeden Kinoliebhaber – dieses Erlebnis ist für die große Leinwand gemacht.",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Amazing movie, much better than the first (which was already really good) and the ending almost left me crying.",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",Original style for once,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",See this movie in a theater! The effects and cinematography are absolutely amazing. One of the best movies Ive seen in a long time.,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Visually it was quite appealing. I guess the story works but still felt disjointed to me. I believe the first movie did a much better job at matching up to the book. If you've read the book there was SO MUCH that was changed. As someone who has read the books, I know that you can't match a book to a movie. There's got to be give and take. I believe part one was done much better than part two, and I actually liked the original Dune better overall. While I full understand and accept needing to add, remove, or change things to fit a book to a movie format, but don't completely change the core of who a character is. Also there was a ton of stuff added to the movie that is not in the books that doesn't even help the story or explain anything. They are just added because they can I guess. There are also many scenes that differed from the book and changed how you perceived them. Over all I give the movie a D+. The actors did a good job, the visuals were great, but the story and plot were kinda blah. Since it was based on a book it felt more like someone took the base ideas and plot points then rewrote the whole thing.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",Visually beautiful and great story throughout,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",Such an amazing action packed movie!,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","I have a AMC subscription, so I see a lot of movies. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a LONG time, and that is saying something. I can't get enough of it, I wish it were 5 hours long. It is such a masterpiece, you can tell so much love and care has been put into it, and all of the actors gave phenomenal performances. I foresee an Oscars sweep in Dune: Part 2's future!",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Quite simply the most emersive experience I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing inside a movie theater. Considering this installment is only 11 minutes longer than Part One, it feels like so much more story arch and character building took place in Part Two compared to Part One (which I thoroughly enjoyed as well). The imagery, costume design, score, and Villenueve's ability to create emotional dialogue between characters without actual words, is second to none in the history of the art form. 

I cannot wait to see it again in the theater, and I'm looking even more forward to physically owning the film so I can watch it over an over again throughout the years. Do yourself a favor, and see this movie in the theater, the score only makes the theater experience worth every penny.",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",Epic Action and Adventure Dune Part 2 the best movie that I ever watch this year,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","WARNING! The following review will have spoilers from DUNE: PART ONE. You have been WARNED! Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is currently doing the impossible: faithfully adapting author Frank Herbert's sci-fi epic, Dune. While DUNE: PART ONE focused on establishing its characters, its massive world, and the power structures within that world, DUNE: PART TWO lets go of the reins and watches what naturally happens. After the downfall of House Atraides at the hands of the ruthless House Harkonnen, Paul Atraides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are in hiding among the Fremen people on the desert planet of Arrakis. Paul is trying to balance a lot in his head. Revenge for his father, helping the Fremen with their ongoing war with the Harkonnen, and denying the faithful Bene Gesserit, who believe in a prophecy involving him. Chalamet does a great job in portraying the growth of his character, sometimes forcing the audience to question themselves. His love interest is Chani (Zendaya), a Fremen warrior who is drawn to who he is, instead of his power. While PART ONE was about fear, PART TWO is about power, and the dangers of it. The story gets deep and complex. The technical aspects of this movie are stellar. The visuals, production design, and cinematography are some of the best I've seen. The scenes with the Harkonnens were filmed using infrared cameras, making them look black and white, while keeping the cold, metallic, savage look of the people. As you might be able to tell, I thought DUNE: PART TWO is a sci-fi masterpiece. The best part about it are the small details of the world Denis has created. From the Fremen language, the mechanized vehicles, and the contrasting cultures. Even the large-scale shots make this feel like a one-of-a-kind theater-going experience. This is why I love going to the theater so much. While watching this, I kept thinking that this must've been what it felt like watching EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, or THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS on the big screen. Previously fleshed out characters going to war against each other, with the potential of an even more epic final movie in the trilogy. Yes, this movie is THAT good. Go see DUNE: PART ONE (if you haven't already), then DUNE: PART TWO on the biggest screen possible!",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Dune Part 2 was hands down, the best Sci-Fi movie I have ever seen. Visually, Avatar 2 has really stunning scenes on a beautiful planet, as opposed to the desert Planet Arrakis. But Avatar ripped off Pocahontas. And you can see where George Lucas ripped off the Dune story, being that Dune the novel came first. With that being said I feel like Dune 2 is better than any of the 9 Star Wars movies. Tattooine is a desert planet, Luke is the chosen one meant to bridge light and dark. The force is like the voice of the Bene Gesserit. The strongest warriors fight with swords not guns, the Universe is controlled by a corrupt emperor. Like cmon, George Lucas straight up stole from Frank Herbert. Go see this movie, it's incredible from start to finish and I can't stop thinking about it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",I expected a little more action,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Visually stunning, with relatively subtle CGI that adds to the story without being distracting. The story is well told. For those who have read the book, it stays as true to the characters and story as possible within the time limitations. There is some artistic license taken, especially with Cheney and Stilgar, to convey the story and drama without the immense detail of the book. The characters are fleshed out well through actions and dialogue without unnecessary explanation from other characters, narration, or other trite storytelling techniques that take away from the story. The whole movie is well-filmed and the story is well-told. The entire theater is left with a sense of wonder at the end, and it stays with you the entire ride home. It is well worth watching. Several times.",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","This installment is far worse than the first. It diverges from the book significantly on many important points. It's tedious, slow and boring. Perhaps one of the worst criticisms is its horrible effects. The crowd scenes have the worst CGI i have ever seen. The people in the crowds look fake as heck. If they make further installments, I won't be wasting my money.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",Exhilarating and suspenseful. Wonderfully made.,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Wow this movie is amazing I'm a new fan to the Dune franchise and after part 1 and 2 I love it! this movie was beautiful, exciting, and action packed. 
Definitely, can't wait for more movie's. Would recommend to see!",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Having read the books and having seen the earlier movie and part 1 I thought that it was way too drawn out and esoteric. Too many kinds of weird visuals that reminded me of drug induced movies of the 70's, psychedelic.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","From what I remember from the previous part of DUNE, it left me wanting more. Well here's the more. Its mostly action and mystic lore from beginning to end. Watch it on the biggest screen you can find.",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Back to the World of Arrakis with an All-Star cast and ""Long live the fighters"" and all that…

But for me, watching ""Dune: Part Two"" was like being trapped in a never-ending sandstorm. It's nearly 3 hours but felt like 5.

Don't it turn my brown eyes blue.

""Dune 2"" ‘s biggest sin is muting the charisma of Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya. It would be more interesting to watch these two young stars eat lunch together than sit through this bloated hot mess.

The plot is as clear as mud to those who haven't read the popular book(s). Much of the film's dialogue is in the desert language of Arrakis, so subtitles are necessary. Not that anyone says anything particularly riveting in any language.

And who thought they'd ever see a fight to the death between Willy Wonka and Elvis?

To be fair, ""Dune 2"" ‘s visual effects are impressive. A colliseum showdown recalled ""Ben-Hur"" & ""Gladiator"". And the climactic showdown between Chalamet & baddee Feyd-Rautha (an unrecognizable Austin Butler) was fairly well-done. But you're 2.5-hours in at that point.

The legions of Dune fans no doubt will eat it up. But for those who aren't desert dwellers, ""Dune 2"" is a tough watch.

May thy sword chip and shatter, indeed.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",Much more real life than fantasy life situations/ decisions,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Building on the promise of its predecessor, Dune: Part Two delivers an ambitious, grand, epic sci-fi thriller. With less setup intended, the long-awaited sequel expands further into the world-building established previously, delving deeper into the Fremen culture, the power dynamics, but most importantly allowing the characters to flourish. Visually speaking, its phenomenal, the vast deserts come alive with breathtaking cinematography and visual effects that seamlessly blend with the practical sets, really makes you wonder how the film is produced at… more",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Loved it.

"Mar 12, 2024",favorite movie this year. World is huge and action is HUGE-ER!,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","Great movie, I know it deviates from the books, for example, some characters' hair, but it's an adaptation that's a good thing, unlike Star Wars or Marvel, which distort the universe",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",Haven't experienced this type of epic cinema in theater since Jackson's LOTR. Peak sci-fi cinema.,POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","best movie I've seen in years, it blows Star Wars out as the best space story",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","I am just now leaving the movie Dune 2, sitting in the parking lot in my car thinking how I could describe the movie to you. The best way for me to describe it is if I was captured by the Marines, sent to Guantánamo Bay and had Chinese water torture for the last 2 1/2 hours or however long the movie was. If I ever decide to go see another Dune movie by this guy which there will, be please stop me by any means necessary!!!",NEGATIVE
"Mar 12, 2024","I've read all of Frank and Brian Herbert's books, and I am an avid fan of sci-fi cinema for over 60 years.  This picture is a ""go see"", as it is on parr with Avatar in its direction, acting, and cinematography.   The picture is close enough to the original work to make Fans like myself go OMG, but the picture strays from the original in ways that make the story even better.  The still-suits better, the thopters better, the worms better.   My only gripe is it was rushed, and way way too short.   DUNE is a ""Game Of Thrones"" space epic from one visionary Clan, father and son, and is worthy of all the HYPE bestowed upon it (sans Season 8).   We couldn't get enough of R. R. Martin's GOT, it will be the same with DUNE if they just take off the gloves and tell every nitty gritty detail Herbert put to paper.",POSITIVE
"Mar 12, 2024",Outstanding conclusion to the original book.,POSITIVE

"Mar 12, 2024","Finally a new movie that had me wanting to be back in a movie theater. Having really enjoyed the first film I had high hopes for this one. This was hands down the best scifi I've seen in years. Visually stunning, plenty of action and scifi adventure all while presenting a number of big themes that keep things thought provoking. The cast here is at their best all the way around but Zendaya really stands out for me throughout. While we see Paul wrestling with his choices how she is reacting and dealing with them really drives things home. In a time where there hasn't been a lot for me to personally celebrate at the local theater this was a very welcome change. This is one I can honestly say should be seen on the big screen in all the spectacle this one can offer.",POSITIVE

"Mar 11, 2024","The kind of Movie Cinema ist there for. What a mesmerizing throwback to true blockbuster popcorn experiences. With it's majestic visuals and soundtrack, DUNE Part Two elevates the story to a new level, going even beyond what it's predecessor 2021 promised. A great cast and Villeneuve's adaptation and deviations from the books and the 1984 manage to keep giving. I honestly have't been so enthralled by a new movie for a long time. The complex story is somehow encapsulated around Paul Atreides own arch and makes for a much more digestible pacing that just keeps upping the stakes and going from one set-piece to the next philosophical level. Highly recommended. Actually, make that a must see.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","A modern-day cinematic masterpiece; the pace of the movie, the cinematography, and the acting are all great. It is an amazing sequel to a great, albeit not flawless, Part One. Denis Villeneuve has really outdone himself this time.",POSITIVE

"Mar 11, 2024","This movie is beyond just a popcorn (bucket) movie, it's a movie that has everything. From the family's conflict to a destiny being fulfilled, to the action-packed sequences with a bit of romance. The run time never came into question.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Dune: Part Two was certainly something. Much like the first, this movie is an experience. The visual effects in this film are so far beyond most Hollywood productions. James Cameron's Avatar is often hailed as VFX at its finest. Dune outdoes it by leaps and bounds. Despite the fantastical and otherworldly spectacle on screen, somehow, it all looks practical. The action sequences are very well done. There are a few one-on-one duels in this movie, and they are so expertly choreographed. It's amazing. Every actor on screen brings their A-game. I can't even describe how real every character feels. Timothée Chalamet delivers a truly Oscar-worthy performance. The world is greatly expanded upon throughout this entire movie. Now that our main characters are with the Fremen, the overarching story really takes off. The first half feels like a direct continuation of the first movie, but there is a noticeable shift in direction by the halfway point. Despite being an enthralling experience the whole time, it starts to become very dense and weighty in the second half, with a heavy focus on religion, destiny, and prophecy. Because of the ""transformations"" that the characters undergo, choices begin to feel out of character, their motivations get muddied, and you begin to feel like you're watching a different film. This works to the film's benefit and its detriment. By the end, you get what the story is going for, but in the moment, it makes little to no sense. The movie's ending is honestly very dissatisfying, but rightfully so considering the circumstances surrounding its conclusion. It gets you to question whether or not the protagonists have become the antagonists, which is one of my all-time favorite storytelling tropes. Despite the movie's astounding production design and execution, the plot brought my overall rating down a notch. I'd give this a 4 out of 5. It's no Godzilla: Minus One, but it's still worth a watch in my opinion.",POSITIVE

"Mar 11, 2024",It was too long and you lost track of who was who as the movie progreed.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Very intense, just like the first one! Too much killing for me, but my husband loved the movie!!  Great special effects & lots of action! All the actors are great!",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Dune 2 is incredible indeed a film that can only be experienced in all is glory in IMAX   the music is enchanting,heartbreaking and full of beauty. The acting was solid and action was amazing",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","That is almost perfection, at least in science fiction field. Great story, wonderful pictures, blasting music, fantastic acting, thrilling adaptation... This Universe has been put to a screen a never seen before way. Congrats to Villeneuve and everyone involved. You can be proud of your amazing work.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Incredible masterpiece of cinematography. The sets, the costumes, the cgi and sound everything just stunning.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Much better paced than it´s predecessor. Excellent timeline. definitely is going to be a Saga to remember.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","This movie was long, but did not disappoint. Even after 3 hours I wanted to see what’s next in Paul and Chani’s story.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",What more could I say about this film than what has already been said? Villeneuve has created an absolute cinematic masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Denis Villeneuve definitely gets the stunning visuals right and Dune 2 was definitely a specticle. Otherwise, there were a lot of good parts in the  story but it was very choppy.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 11, 2024",Amazing Amazing Amazing. The way Denis was able to capture the true heart of Dune while also bringing an incredibly unique take on this world as well was an absolute thrill to see. I left the theatre utterly speechless. Perfectly Perfectly casted.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","absolutely the perfect movie that i was searching for years, thanks denis villenueve for this movie, i love you.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Amazing experience. I almost thought i was the messiah once i got out of the theater.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",It lived up and more! I could watched the movie again straight away,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Please see it at the cinema if you can. You need noise and vibration! The casting is superb..the acting second to none. The special effects are amazing and the cinematography is incredible.  I think its probably one of the best films I've ever seen. Takes me back to feeling like a kid watching El Cid. Breathtakingly epic.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Takes a bit to get going, but it's absolutely enthralling once it gets there. Jessica's story became one of my favorites, despite her being a bit lackluster in the previous film. Stilgar also ended up being a standout, bringing some much needed humor to the heavy tones. Oh, and Austin Butler! What a wild dude. Loved him. Timothée is certainly fine 😉 but in this movie, he is actually just, you know, fine. He does an acceptable job but he's not really bringing much uniqueness to the role, despite being the lead.

It's really the directing and the visuals that make this movie worth seeing. My favorite scene was by far the first sandworm ride. There's just such a sense of immense scale and speed that flies off the screen. Despite really only taking place in one environment (the fucking sand), the film brings enough variety in its stylings that it doesn't really get old.

By the end of the film, the story becomes very engaging. I loved the way that Paul and Chani's relationship was explored and complicated throughout the film, with some unexpected turns of events towards the end. This movie has done a solid job of setting up the next film and I'm excited to see where these stories go.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Visually stunning, each performance was captivating and powerful.. desperate to see it again already",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",This movie takes off from the first one like a rocket and leaves you ready for Part III,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","game-changing... if the first movie was setting the bar for blockbusters and cinematic experiences, this (Part II) could well be on its way to changing movies and movie culture forever. I have never seen a movie in IMAX before and this movie was (admittedly) perfect for cinema. But more than that, the scope of storytelling was incredible. Brilliant acting, Denis Villeneuve at peak filmmaking best, great direction, costume and visuals were on point, a score to send shivers down your spine... the word I would best use to describe this is IMMERSIVE! Truly, and completely immersive... cannot remember the last time I felt so deep inside an epic like this. Takes you on a journey from start to finish. IMMERSIVE! Deserves every good word said about it. A follow-up that does justice to the first movie and in many ways, adds to the brilliance that we are privy to. Cinematic genius.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Awesome IMAX experience, its my second viewing of the movie!  I can’t wait for the third installment of the series! 😊",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Brilliant movie, kept me gripped the whole 3 hours.  First hour felt like 2 and the last 2 hours felt like 1!",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Dune part 2 is overrated it seems like they spent all thier money on the cast and not on the movie itself. Christopher Walken might not even survive for a third movie and it felt like elder abuse even watching him in this role. They eliminated the weirding way from the movie which is going to complicate any further movies. The voice is only part of the wierding way the other half is a foot technique and a hand technique. The hand technique isn't introduced for a few books later. Jessica seems like she is better then Paul at seeing the future which is crazy why need him at all. The ending scene which is supposed to be an emperor thrown room looks like they ran out of money and shot it in a supply closet. Paul who is supposed to see the future getting stabbed twice is insane. At the end of the book and the other movies Paul takes off his shirt to show that he has been in countless battles but has never been scared. Wait till it's on HBO.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Loved this movie start to finish! Such a fan.  The sounds, the visuals, and the acting were all phenomenal. Story was perfectly executed.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","ground-breaking.... this movie will change cinematic history. I've never wanted to see a movie twice in one week but here we are!!! the acting is amazing, the directing, costumes, visuals, the score...its like truly watching a story and getting immersed in it! kudos to everyone 👏🏾",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","The Visuals were fantastic, locations, action scenes, scenes with the Worms.   Some of it felt cheap with the worm scenes from a distance as they surf across the sand, but overall it just left me with more questions than answers.   I have seen all three versions of this film adaptation of Dune.  The original movie from 1984 was too short and really did not have time to tell the story.  the 2000 Version Sifi channel version was a lot better than the 1984 movie.  This latest version felt a lot like Lawrence of Arabia, a grand movie, but slow moving, with some action, a lot of scene changes, characters being introduced and you do not get a true feeling for who they are.    I have never read the books, maybe that would give me a better appreciation for the two movies.  But this is deeper than most Star Wars movies which tend  to be a fun ride, Lord of the Rings was epic, Dune is about sand and spice, it is not everything nice.  But the visuals were fantastic.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",one of the best movies ever made!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Never loved a movie enough to give it a rating. Due Part ll was a masterpiece!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",This is what movies are supposed to be!,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Enjoyed the movie thoroughly. Wished it was a little longer which might sound crazy now. Worth the watch in Dolby Atmos movie theater.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Visually stunning, but may be hard to follow if you're not familiar with the story outline.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Dune 2 was everything I expected and more for a sequel to an equally brilliant film. Our local AMC theater was also top notch. Highly recommended.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","One of the greatest achievements in cinematic history, hands down.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","This is a big theater movie. But story and story telling will work on your home entertainment systems as well. Admittedly I am not one of the readers is the books, but this tells so much more than the 80s Dune. One of the best shot films in a long time.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Ce film va au-delà de toutes espérances. La trame sonore est exceptionnelle. Le visuel est sans mot. À la finale, je me suis demandé pourquoi c'était fini. J'aurais encore pris 2 heures de plus, les 3 heures ont passé comme une heure trente.

Juste incroyable.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","It's a very good film, well paced, good character development, not overly complex and a production value that blows other sci-fi films out the water. This is high quality work. I particularly like that the big war scene is kept simple, exciting but not overlong. The drawback for me was the length. For a simple tale, all based in the desert, it feels arduous to stay awake throughout. I took a few closed eye moments to get through. I can;t question the quality of the film though. Very good. Watched at the O2 arena Cineworld.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Great cinematography. Great action,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Great CGI special effects but the script is somewhat of a disappointment. Book adaptations always are a distortion of the original story. What is in the script is brilliantly executed. The ending suggests a Chapter 3, Children of Dune, all about Alia and Leto, Jessica's unborn twins.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","I haven't stopped thinking about it for 3 days. It may be visually the best looking film I have ever seen. Absolutely gorgeous set pieces and production design. Great balance between practical sets and VFX (not that you can even tell the difference with how well done this film is). It was a great continuation of the story that went in some unexpected and exciting directions. I haven't read the books so not sure how faithful of an adaptation it is, but if anything was changed or left out that was in the books Villeneuve made the right call in doing so because it was a full and complete vision for a cinematic audience. The long run time to me did not feel excessive or drawn out. Paid equal attention to action, plot, and story making it well balanced. All of the acting was great. It was played by the actors and set up by the direction so that even in such a dense story, suspension of disbelief was not really challenging because of how immersive this universe is and how well flushed out the story and characters were. Wish I could have seen in IMAX, but definitely a film to see in the theater. Really hope the third one (assuming it will be green lit) sticks the landing. Just incredible.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Denis Villeneuve's unique aesthetic and cinematographic language beautifully portray the beauty of the sands of Arrakis; Hans Zimmer's soundtrack takes the combination of visuals and auditory experience to an unparalleled height. Dune may not be suitable for everyone in this fast-paced society, but it precisely reminds us of the true meaning of enjoying blockbuster films in theatres.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Masterpiece! Its everything Star Wars wishes it could be. Take note Disney.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","If you like the first movie then you'll love the second one. Much more action pack than the first. Great directing, storyline, music...It was worth the movie ticket price.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Incredible visuals help drive this epic Sci-Fi experience. Denis Villeneuve expertly crafts an amazing story about love vs destiny, hope vs faith and honor vs duty. The score, cinematography and sound are all top tier. Easily one of the best films of the last 20 years",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Cannot believe how good this was. Pleasing the cult core fans of Dune books/lore and then also surpassing expectations of an average commercial viewer seems nearly impossible and yet Denis Villeneuve does it. Remarkable. Saw it twice in the first two weeks just to unpack the amount of plot and action they gave us. Will need to see it two more times just to fully appreciate the insane visual and musical artistry of every scene.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",The movie was well done overall.  It did depart from the novel towards the end.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Terrible movie. Very boring and two main actors (young guy and girl ) were awful . Glad my gf bought the tickets and I did not waste money on this.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Awesome spectacle in IMAX especially. I pity anyone who doesn't see the brilliance in the movie making here. Truly fantastic adaptation of an incredible book.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Amazing, even better than the 1st. Watch in IMAX laser if you can!",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Aside from some minor changes diverting from the books, the Dune movies are loyal to the source material, and beautifully shot.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Excellent movie, part 3 coming soon I hope ",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Christopher Walken again, yeah sure, why not. Great actor.
But am I the only wanting him to say it? Come on Christopher, say it.
""You know, I flew across the galaxy to get here. Honestly, the place could use more sandworm. As a matter of fact, I got a fever and the only prescription is more sandworm."" He NEVER did.
Speaking of sandworms. I was hoping for more character development for the sandworms. Maybe a table scene like in Reservoir Dogs where they discuss tipping.
I still don't know their likes, dislikes, what motivates them. Next movie creating guys...give us more sandworm!
One more gripe. Where's the heart plugs? Not the first dam heart plug.
Honestly though, it was OK. I wouldn't drool over it like some of the reviews. It was good but not THAT great. Wait for it to come out on VHS (yeah I know).",NEUTRAL

"Mar 11, 2024","I have been waiting for Part 2 after seeing Dune Part 1.  In one word: MAGISTERIAL.  The filming, done , as I observed, in a kind of tan like the sand. Filming, music and really exceptional acting, completed a truly outstanding movie. Timothy Shalamee is simply perfect as is Javier Bardem!",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Watched Dune part 2 at a i-max cinema. I honestly think this movie is a cinematic masterpiece! But that's just my opinion of course.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Started strong, went long, kind of peetered out IMHO.......  Different movie from the first one, much more action, solid, well played love story with strong chemistry, overall entertaining.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Awesome.  Perfect music.  Great acting.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Gorgeous cinematography, powerful score, and star-studded cast make for an excellent science fiction movie. Dune Part Two provides an excellent adaptation of the classic book and transports viewers to Arrakis. The dialogue is mostly serious and plot-driven, but there are some humorous moments. The action scenes are well-choreographed and every scene is shot in such a way that the viewer can actually see and understand what is happening. The stylistic choices are bold and the costumes are gaudy. My only critique is that the pacing is occasionally a bit slow in the movie's efforts to transport you to the desert. Overall, I would recommend Dune Part Two for fans of science fiction movies.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Hate endings that obviously set you up for another installment.,POSITIVE

At this point it was just a dissapointment, I'm glad those of you enjoyed it, did, apart from the beautiful visuals and spine tingling music It was just not the Dune I know, it was a shade of what Dune is.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 11, 2024","Very similar to the first movie in both its strengths and weaknesses. Fantastic visuals, music and sound, but a story that feels like it's building and building and building and then just kind of leaves you hanging for the next part. To be fair, I do think there is a bit more resolution in this one, and Chalamet's character arc becomes more interesting, but I think I won't be able to properly rate these movies until I know the full story. I am definitely excited for Part 3 though.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","The scenes are more dramatically and beautifully choreographed than in the previous edition, taking place in various settings that include shootouts above dunes and gladiatorial fights at House Harkonnens' massive colosseum.
Besides such extremely long-shot battle scenes, the director's portrayal of Paul learning to summon sandworms that snake through a sandstorm toward their prey is a spectacle -- and a major reason the movie must be watched in Imax.
The scale of the film creates an overwhelming sense, as does the message throughout the film. A hero's victory might just make the universe even uglier, it says.
Chalamet displays a detailed, wide range in his portrayal of a young man's cautious rise to power -- including the intensity of his worries and childlike loneliness in front of his true love Chani (Zendaya) -- in a universe dominated by inhumanity. The director contains Paul's changing emotions in a tight shot; a clear contrast to the pale, bald Harkonnen and the ruthless gaze of the violent prince Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). The visual palette becomes bleached in monochrome in the switch to Feyd-Rautha's story, away from Paul and Chani, making an illuminating comparison.",POSITIVE

"Mar 11, 2024","cinematically beautiful but it seems there is so much left out, even the 1984 movie at least gives you the scope of things, I feel this missed the mark and will be remade in 10 years...

"Mar 11, 2024","The last time I remember this feeling was probably seeing the Star Wars prequels in theaters, and it dawned on me because space operas and fantasy series of this scale are such a once-in-a-generation occurrence. As an adaptation, this truly is a monumental feat to pull off that is done deftly, paring down what needs to be sliced, modernizing aspects that make it more palatable, and maintaining the gravitas of what makes sci-fi so mesmerizing. With stellar performances, cinematography, and music, the only thing that would make this a five-star film is that once all three are out we will likely all realize how much better they flow together by being able to watch them at once.",POSITIVE

It's deeply moving and spiritual. You have to check it out.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Dune 2 is a fully immersive and sprawling sci-fi epic, with awesome moments of sci-fi action and theological intrigue, spread throughout an organically paced build-up to the romantic coupling of its two leads, who succeed at bringing the audience along for the ride. Albeit, the meticulously crafted storytelling does lead to, what feels like, a rushed climax, a common criticism of the original film as well. Despite the inevitable issue with the ending, this film has it all and I sense many repeat viewings in my future. # New favourite sci-fi movie!",POSITIVE

"Mar 11, 2024",Owen Kim's performance in Dune 2 was absolute perfection. Like pure cinema. An absolute classic. Owen has done it once again.,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Dune 2 captivates with its stunning visuals, adrenaline-pumping action sequences, and an unforgettable score, complemented by outstanding performances from Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler, making it a modern sci-fi classic",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","I am a fan of the books, and the movie. I will not pretend to be a critic. So here is my review: This  movie was mind blowing awesome!",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Way too long. Not enough story to justify a 2:45 run time.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 11, 2024","Excellent story-telling!  A great sequel to the first movie filled with action, drama, and a nice setup for a third installment!",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Epic, sweeping cinematography and story! Finally the book series has a worthy onscreen telling!",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Duna foi uma obra de arte, em décadas de filmes bons, duna apareceu para ser a maior obra feita, sendo uma adaptação perfeita aos livros, ao diretor Denis Villeneuve os parabéns pelo impecável trabalho",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Denis Villeneuve manages to assemble a compelling tale at a scale that is unfathomable. Utilizing its scale to deliver bombastic spectacle the likes have not been seen but still able to execute story beats with laser precision. Somehow able to juggle various characters, locations, and plot elements with no stutters or faults. The performances are sensational with Austin Butler and Javier Bardem as the real standouts. Both chewing up the scenery leaving an impression in every scene they are in. The action is high flying kinetic energy. And the world feels as if it right there, just a split second from falling into the Dunes of Arrakis. And at the center is a cautionary tale about prophecies, foresight, and a chosen one. But when Hanz simmer score blares as we see Paul rise its hard not cheer. Quite frankly a masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Great action packed movie. Wish ending wrapped up better,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Cinematic were awesome. Great movie!,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","Amazing movie! I've seen it twice now and I'll see it as many times as I can while it's still in theaters. I've read all the Dune books by Frank Herbert and I think the way the writers have adapted the story to film is brilliant. The acting, the cinematography, the amazing visuals, the whole thing is just so exciting to watch and experience. Can't wait for the next one!",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024",Most probably the best movie ever made,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","This is dune, this is an every most faithful recreation of dune. It's an epic, in epic proportions. It is beautiful and action filled, it has a cohesive plot. This is what I hoped it COULD be and so much more. If this is what people think of first when I mention frank Herbert's Dune, then I would be happy.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Improved over the first one. Exciting story. The duration flies by,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","It was an epic sci-fi feature with top-notch effects, but the director's changes to the story were disappointing.  He effectively removed the supernatural aspect of Paul. He portrayed him as just a man with a minor gift of precognition, and his followers as ignorant idiots believing in a messiah, not the demi-god his character should have become.  They completely removed the space guilds, and the navigators and left a hollow shell.  They could have made his drinking of the water of life epic but instead just had him take a nap.  So disappointing.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 10, 2024",It was as good as the first part.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Storyline was interesting and kept moving- no lags. I enjoyed the recognizable actors and the end leaves you wanting more!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",A beautifully crafted adaptation of Herbert's series. Only to be seen in IMAX for the full experience.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Absolute masterpiece, doesn't follow the book completely but shows a lot more action, plot twist that changed the story beautifully, amazingly placed ‘dune' in conversation. Has a high chance of being the best film of 2024",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","loved the overall feel of the movie.  it is long, but I never got bored.  lots of action and world building.  some deviation from the book, but still faithful to the original story.  hope they make Dune Messiah.  the music did get too loud during the killing of the Baron. My only dislike: you could not hear what Muhadib was saying.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","CINEMA PURO! Infinitamente melhor que o primeiro, me arrepiei em várias cenas. A proporção é muito maior das disputas políticas e religiosas, dá pra entender cada conflito e interesse. A evolução do Paul é absurda e faz a gente torcer por ele. Todos os aspectos técnicos são impecáveis, não deve em nada em VFX, trilha sonora, fotografia, direção de arte, atuação do elenco incrível, tudo continua no mais alto nível. Um filme absoluto em tudo que propõe.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","When you give a really good director really good source material, you are bound to get something great. So that was not a surprise, however what was a surprise was the fact that this has me liking this interpretation of Dune, more than the book. I think this version is much more clear about its warning of blindly following Messiac figures.
9/10 can't wait to see how they wrap it up.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",This is how great movies are supposed to make you feel pleasantly overcome with nostalgia visually satisfying obsessed with the story,POSITIVE

Looked lovely, sounded amazing - shame it couldn't keep me awake.  The best part was making an excuse to go to the bathroom halfway through.
Just can't believe I spent £40 for 2 to sit through this tripe!",NEGATIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Denis Villeneuve has managed to finally create a true Dune blockbuster, which is touching the hearts and minds of the American mainstream in a way I've never seen in my lifetime. While I have some quibbles about characterization and form, every complaint is met and surpassed by stellar acting, sound, design, and overall visual appeal. We've got people on board, time to reel them in for Dune Messiah, where it really goes weird.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Ok WOW.  Heart pounding, intense, dramatic. It’s a must see movie for 2024 !!",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",can't handle the cliff hangers!,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Dune 2 was a completely engaging movie. The scenery was outstanding, the costumes were just right, and the music helped tell and drive the story. The pacing and editing were excellent, a slow burn driving the story perfectly. A lot was communicated by the body acting of the actors, not needing dialogue to understand the point.
Outstanding. I may see it again in the theater.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Very close to the book!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Absolutely stunning, a must see at the cinema",POSITIVE

"Mar 10, 2024",Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Even better then the first.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Fantastic. I liked  the first part, and part two was 100% better. Saw it on a full sized IMAX screen and that is the way to see this movie. The visuals were stunning. The story was a great interpretation of the source. Did NOT feel like it was a 2hr 40m run time.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Really sets the story in a more dramatic way with more of the elements being introduced and shown.. Very good adaption!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",This movie was amazing :),POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Visually and audibly impressive. I enjoyed the first act, did not like the second and the third was ok. I am not a sci-fi fan in particular, maybe that is why, as I know everyone seems to love this one. I just found it boring. Some good performances though. Worth checking out to form your own opinion.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 10, 2024","unnecessarily long and boring. actually took a nap for 5 mins, went to the bathroom and got some snacks. Boring and overhyped.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 10, 2024","It was a solid adventure and science fiction movie that closely followed Frank Herberts science fiction novel of ?the 1970s.  

If you like science fiction, galactic wars, this is a very good movie. If you hadnt read the novels, the story is sometimes hard to follow.. There is a lot of violence.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 10, 2024",Must see! We are literally witnessing a movie trilogy as epic as the LOTR playing out before our very own eyes. Can’t wait for Dune Messiah!,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Visually breathtaking. Where Dune Part 1 is more of a set up story, Dune Part 2 makes no mistakes when executing on the stage its put on. Plenty of action, character depth, and incredible delivery of a story many are familiar with from the saga's writer, Frank Herbert. From what I understand, Dune Part 2 largely completes the first Dune book and sets up the story told in Dune: Messiah and will complete Paul Atreides' story arc. What an arc it is from a film adaptation. Dune Part 2 will go down as one of the GOAT adaptations with its incredible scale and equal focus on depth and polish. A must-see in theaters if you get the chance. Just don't watch this on a small screen and without good audio - everything is an experience in Dune Part 2.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",This movie you want to watch at the theatre. Amazing  cinematography!!,POSITIVE

"Mar 10, 2024",Epic!! Simple as that.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Great cinematography fairly true to the book. 
I brought younger kids (8,10) as we had watched Part 1 at home - it was definitely a bit more violent and graphic than we would have liked even for a PG-13 movie.",POSITIVE

"Mar 10, 2024","EPIC! I know there's sniveling about departures from the books, but, oh well, it happens with all great works. Don't go, if you can't get over it. A masterpiece! And, this is from someone who has read all five books, three times throughout my life! 3",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Definitely delivered to the hype.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Yawn… this is the last superhero or sci-fi movie made by a big company that I'll ever allow myself to be dragged to. Modern  mainstream cinema just isn't very good anymore. This movie was very boring with a few cool scenes but overall was just really contrived. there's nothing great about it. It's just that modern films are so bad that this seems good but it really isn't.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Espectacular, aunque soy un fan de la novela y Villenueve se toma licencias, y me choca la desaparición absoluta de la Cofradía Espacial, la película es ÉPICA.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",it was really good with lots of action and intensity.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","This movie followed the story line of the book quite well - Special effects were very good, the transition of one of the main characters (Paul) from young idealist to skilled and ambitious leader was well done, also well done acting to Zendaya.",POSITIVE

"Mar 10, 2024","Beautiful film! It is visually gorgeous without being boring. I'm sure having read the book helped follow the throughline of the story. I'm rating if five stars because of the production design, cinematography, acting and costumes as well as for Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya who were captivating and luminous. The ending was stranger than expected. I am thinking there has to be a third installment coming.",POSITIVE

"Mar 10, 2024",This movie become one of my favorites of all time,POSITIVE

"Mar 10, 2024","I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie as it unfolded a captivating narrative where the Fremen, deeply committed to Paul, extend their allegiance to the point of initiating a holy war across the vast expanse of the galaxy after he ascends the throne. In the aftermath, Paul's followers zealously carry out this cosmic crusade in his name, resulting in the tragic loss of lives for those who resist accepting him as a divine being. This gripping culmination unfolds at the very end of Dune, adding a layer of complexity and intensity to the storyline.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 10, 2024","I have to see it again. I have thoughts. But well played, Mr. Villanueve.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","It is a fittingly spectacular climax to the story. I like how grand the movie is while simultaneously making the viewer question whether it's triumphant or ominous. Dune Part 2 has great choreography and combined with Villeneuve's eye and Zimmer's score becomes an exceptional cinematic experience. Like its source material, the story is more intellectual than emotional which might not be everyone's preference but I like that it feels different from other grand fantasy/sci-fi stories.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Ever finished a movie and sat in silence for the remainder of the credits? Same story here. One of the best movies i've ever watched. I literally do not have a single complaint about this movie. It took me 3 hours to start working the night after watching, as I had to read more about it.

Dune 'Messiah' can't come soon enough.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Dune: Part 2 is one of the most incredible experiences I’ve had when it comes to cinema.

"Mar 10, 2024",Action packed!  Better than Part One!,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","I'm glad Dune finally has a truly epic and outstanding movie adaptation. This film and the one before it carried such an incredible burden of expectations and as a pair they mostly deliver. There is just such a dense plot to Dune and they struggle to pull it all together. That said, the films are still great. The acting in Dune Part 2 is great and the visuals are astonishing. The pure imagination at play is an incredible sight to behold. Dune Part 2 is intelligently modernized too, in terms of some of the more ""problematic"" themes of the novel, and some of the characters (especially Chani) are given much more depth and much more meaningful roles. Some characters are lost altogether to make room for everything, but I believe the choices made were all good and in service of telling a better story. The movie is a bit awkward in the way it tries to join so many complex pieces together, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't see it. You absolutely should.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Dbox seats TOTALLY WORTH IT! Actual Cinema.....On par with LOTR, Star Wars etc. Cast, score, crew op in a REAL desert, directing, camera work, ALL top scores!  I can't wait for part 3. Hopefully they don't make us wait too long

My only gripe was the scene where the spice tankers were taken out. They have to get up close to take it out but minutes later they use a laser beam to blow it up easy. And later in the movie during the montage they do that also. So what was the point of that whole sequence? Maybe I missed something.",POSITIVE

"Mar 10, 2024","Well made film. I was hoping for an unopened ending, but I understand that there is potential for more films based on the novels available. If they maintain a high level of quality as this version of Dune 1 and 2 have, that's not a big deal. Keep this level of writing, directing, and acting goes through, or you will lose me.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 10, 2024","Aka: Beige 2, revenge of the beige.
Better than part one yes, but mostly just because someone seems to have sat behind the director and slapped him every time he tried to use slow motion. The plot is predictable and a very poorly disguised allegory that doesn't make sense these days, the Fremen are clearly the world's worst freedom fighters given that they seem to have better weapons than the space-faring armies who just fight with swords for some reason and poor Florence Pugh just gets put in a series of worse and worse head pieces seemingly designed to make her look more and more like she has a condom on her head....",NEGATIVE

"Mar 10, 2024","Great Adaptation , soundtrack is amazing",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","I thought it was very well made overall. From the acting (Timothée Chalamet in particular was really great) and the details of each scene, it was incredibly enjoyable. It did not feel like three hours!",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Fantastic! When does part 3 come out? Special effects fantastic . Fight scenes very convincing. Great acting. Cinematography was beautiful.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","4 star because the first hour of the movie was meh for me, but after that it was awesome. It took off and I was so sad it ended, I will be waiting for the next part.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Several changes to source, but maintains the tone and themes of Herbert's book. Some of the best shot design I've seen in years, almost every wide shot is awe inspiring.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Impressive visuals, but insufficient scheming and plotting. Felt merely action.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 10, 2024",Best sci-fi fantasy since LOTR. 10/10.,POSITIVE

"Mar 10, 2024","If you are a fan of the book 1st, you may not like this movie.  The movie changes  the influence of Paul’s sister and the relationship with Chani and their child that they lose due to the enemy attack. The movie ends where the book ended, but the relationship between Paul and Chani is not canon to the book. Where are they going with the story if there is a sequel?",NEGATIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Absolutely excellent. From the scenery, the outfits but the actors shine. Timothee Chalamet does so well in this character. Every actor is award winning in this movie. Can't wait for Dune 3",POSITIVE

"Mar 10, 2024",Top five movie of my life.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",One of the best movie science fiction to be honest much better than Star Wars I hope to see it part 3 🗿🥷🏻,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Denis Villeneuve has brought the incredible novel to the screen the only way it could've been. While there are some big differences, it near-perfectly adapts the book based on Herbert's original theme of a cautionary tale for messianic figures. Add in the incredible score, filmography/cinematography, and powerful acting by an amazing cast, this movie is one of the closest possible to perfect.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Awesome movie and great acting! Can't wait to see the next one!,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",You Must watch in the theater to get a sense of how vast Arrakis is! The desert is so beautiful and the acting was great. Lots of world-building to get a feel for a futuristic alien world and alien culture. I can't wait to see part three!!!,POSITIVE

"Mar 10, 2024","Extremely well done in a grand manner.  Great acting, pacing, and action sequences.  Makes me want to read the book.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",I thought it was good. Different then the original,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Yes, visually a nice film.  Overall, I was kind of bored.  It is not a film I will think much more about.  I guess I am not geeky enough to understand it.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","The story continues to engage and even surprise you from the original. At the same time, conveying this detailed and complex tale can become tedious task. As a fan of the 80s original Im all in and ready for part 3.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","I'm a Zendaya fan which is why I went to see Dune 2 today…I WISH I HADN'T WENT.

THE HOLLYWOOD MOGULS NO DOUBT PAID THE CRITICS A $1000 BUCKS EACH,TO SAY WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT THIS SNOOZE FEST.

IF U WANT SAND ,BAD CGI AND HEAVY BREATHING AND FACIAL CONTORTIONS [OH AND MORE SAND] IN THE PLACE OF A GOOD STORY AND CAPTIVATING ACTING THEN GO SEE THIS THING . I HAVE AGAIN WASTED MY TIME AND MONEY ON YET ANOTHER STINKER THIS YEAR. 

JASON STATHAM,LIAM NEESON AND DWAYNE ""The Rock"" Johnson thank you for entertaining me in the past and PLEASE come out with something soon to save me from these bad movies being forced on the public since early 2023.


By the way Denis Villeneuve the director should be arrested and thrown in jail,he apparently had SAND in his eyes while attempting to direct🤨🤨🤨",NEGATIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","While not perfect, I was entertained and felt the story was a closer adaptation than the previous attempt in the 80’s.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","A sequel is meant to up the ante and Dune: Part Two accomplishes this by expanding on themes of colonization, faith, and more, with larger-scale action and a broader scope.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Written extraordinarily. Must watch,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Simplemente... cine puro,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Movie was slow and too long.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 10, 2024",Very well developed and intense.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Paul is bland, almost robotic. Tone basically only changes when he's yelling. Timothy is the worst actor to play Paul.

Chani deviated to much from books, previous movies, and lacks trust/faith in Paul. Chanis first child didn't happened either.

Paul's sister wasn't born by the end",NEGATIVE

"Mar 10, 2024","Not a perfect film but considering the sorry state of current Hollywood, Dune is far better than we had any right to expect.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Boring boring boring made me fall asleep,NEGATIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Movie was awesome, however it was probably 78-82° in the theater. I’ll admit it was immersive bc of the heat but at $20 a ticket I expect to be comfortable. Also, not sure why Lynnhaven 18 has poverty seating in all of their imax theaters.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Masterpiece- cast CGI world building directing score… I’ve seen it twice,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Best movie I have seen in years.   Hit's it out of the park on all aspects of what makes a great movie:  a beautiful and subtle refined script that with few words and wonderful acting and directing successfully portrays the layered interacting complexities of culture, character, power, religion, leadership and mass movements, with the added aspects of new planet ecologies, and the marvelous blend of futuristic technologies in battle scenes that includes old fashioned knife fights, and monstrous sand worms.   Then there is the pitch perfect music/sound track, amazing scenic vistas, and meticulous film craft.  Go see this movie even if you are not a science fiction fan...you will not be disappointed!",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",MUST SEE IN IMAX. THE SOUND THE VISUAL EFFECTS ARE STUNNING. AWESOME MOVIE. The filmmakers did a great job telling the story. I felt like i was in the movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Great movie. Very action packed and picked up from the last movie right away,POSITIVE

"Mar 10, 2024",Finally a movie to go watch at the big screen and didn't disappoint.  Action packkkkkkkkkk!!! ready for part 3.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","For the most. It was pretty good, until the ending part. I I'm seeing why they have so many sequels. It put you in the same frame of mine as the Star wars movies, just to create other story lines. A movie night soap Opera for the Big screens. Yet it was worth seeing.",POSITIVE

"Mar 10, 2024","I have so much to say about Dune Part Two, but I am gobsmacked after watching it and struggle to write something at the moment that will do it justice. Let me just say this: Dune Part Two is the best sci-fi movie ever made. 

By saying that, I'm ignoring an ""apples vs. oranges"" argument that some sci-fi movies are probably too different to compare, so I'll try to lay out my case by comparing Dune Part Two to the four sci-fi movies that I think are the cream of the crop (for sci-fi movies set in space). 

2001 a Space Odyssey - This is 1 on many lists. It was groundbreaking and epic due to technical achievements, cinematography, and a fascinating story by Arthur C. Clarke. But Dune outperforms 2001 in all those categories (and it's never boring). 

Alien - This is probably an orange to Dune's apple, but it has a fond place in my heart, given it was my first R-rated movie. But the things that made me love Alien, including the sets, ship architecture, and costumes/spacesuits, I loved to death in Part Two. 

Star Wars - Putting this ahead of George Lucas' classic took some mental gymnastics. I was 10 when it was released, and my friends and I saw it probably 20 times. It was groundbreaking, exhilarating, and EPIC. While Dune is targeted more at adults and isn't as ""fun"" as Star Wars, but I think Villeneuve just created a new generation of rabid sci-fi fans that will reinvigorate the genre going for many years to come. 

Empire Strikes Back - This is a tough one as this is my favorite Star Wars, and my previous all-timer. It's got the best script and action of the triple trilogy, but I will have to give the edge to Dune. 

I told my boys to remember watching this today. Years from now, they'll remember this day fondly. Like I did when I saw Star Wars when it first opened. And Alien. And so on.

""It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future."" -Frank Herbert",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",I've read the book many times. They did a really good job of getting the vast scope of the novel to fit into the two films!,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",É um ótimo filme. A evolução do filme é surpreendente e deixa o filme top.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Beautiful visuals and a thunderous score and overall a fantastic cinematic spectacle, though sometimes I felt like the need for spectacle took away a human element of the film? This style really captures both the beauty and the horror of the world that has been very built here, but it also made me feel a little distant from the characters. Paul's arc didn't really hit me emotionally as I felt it should, but it was written very well and was compelling nonetheless.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Loved it!  Great epic movie,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Even better than Part 1, Dune 2 gets your attention from the beginning til the end!",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Really liked this movie it was fun to watch but it was a little to long!,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Great movie and great actors. Action packed but left us a little confused in the end as it did not end as the original movie did so not sure if there will be a sequel, but still a great movie and would see again.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Awesome entertainment ion a grand scale!,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Epic cinema!  Austin Butler is incredible in this.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",It was very well written and the length of it allowed for character development. As a Star Wars fan I'm very jealous of the care they took with the story and development of characters,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",This is what cinema should be.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Masterpiece! Even better than part 1, absolutely mind-blowing to me as a huge book fan!",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Wow!!!! After watch Dune2. Dune is now my favorite movie of all times!,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",I really liked it!  This was so much more of the story. Even though it was long it moves quickly.  The production was beautiful.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Absolutely amazing! Per usual this Dune movie was done just as well as the first!! Can't wait for the next one.
Now I'm rereading the series lol",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Great film. Delivered better than I was even expecting.  One of the best sci-fi movies ever made.,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Obra maestra!!!! Visualmente espectacular, una joya de la ciencia ficción que perdurará durante decadas.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Visually amazing, fantastic story. Never felt like it was long or dragging, pacing felt right.  I have never read the book and dont have too much background on the story but I felt amazing walking out of the theater. It was an intense feeling. Cant wait for the third one",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","This is a masterpiece. Easily joins the ranks of the best film series ever made. This series goes above and beyond, and rivals the best middle movies in trilogy history. Its a must see.",POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Delivered in a big way! Thanks for exceeding my expectations!,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",I fell asleep and then left before the movie ended.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","A watered down, overly long movie that strays way too far from the book.  Visually stunning, hence the second star, but otherwise does complete disservice to the book with gratuitous (and cringe) creative liberties taken.  Villneavue either didnt read the book, or completely disregarded it.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Absolutely Amazing Cinema,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Best movie I have ever seen in my entire life,POSITIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","It is hard to describe how totally poor this movie was. I went with my family so was unable to leave. I was deprived of my liberty! Quite frankly I would have left if I were by myself. This movie was anything but ""Dune"". Having to sit for nearly three hours without a bucket was quite a challenge. I should be given my money back. In fact, it was me who should have been paid to sit through that tripe. There was zero integrity to the book (which is a classic), and it seemed to be a school-boy's attempt at Science Fiction.  The movie's modernisation, use of cliche CGI hues/effects and poor acting itself was nearly unbearable. The secret to any good film is to take you to another world, like Science Fiction always should, while feeling like you are there right there in the story. This film was simply a cringe with little nuance or creativity.  They failed on every level to create a decent rendering of the book, let alone, a good movie. I cannot believe the reviews are even positive for this movie. I would describe the plot as a defilement of the original concept and the author's masterpiece. Forgetting the movie producers' integrity to the brilliant seminal novel, the world of ""Dune"" that they created was like a suburban love story set in a desert outside Arizona rather than the fictional Arrakis. The Fremen, the desert dwellers, were portrayed as quasi-nomads who in actuality were more like middle-class American dressed in rags. The supposed battle-hardened Fremen provided funny one-liners and debated amongst themselves about religious matters, giggled and had the all the latest social characteristics of middle-America. When I heard raucous laughing in the cinema after the Fremen entertained the crowd, I nearly laughed myself given the ridiculous plot-line being unfurled. Unfortunately I cannot rate this film a minus, but this has put me off ever going to the movies again. It will take me a while to recover from this one. I feel Hollywood is a desert wasteland and the new ""Dune"" is a biography of their world: Los Angeles is the new Arrakeen (see the movie to find out more...).",NEGATIVE
"Mar 10, 2024","Probably the best cinematic expérience since lord of the Ring. Story, pictures, actors, musics, etc. Everything is awsome. Hope these movie will make change all Marvel plans.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Movie was brilliant, excellent cinematography and music score. The film kept me engaged and the time length had flown by so quickly.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",This movie was an epic closely aligned with the novel. A great movie!,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Experienced it in IMAX and was blown away by the cinematography and sound editing. The acting was great as well. A must-see in theatres!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",An excellent slow burn of dramatic scenes and character development. Great soundtrack like the first one.,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Best film adaptation to a book ever!,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Childish, pointless and a waste of time.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Fantastic movie. See it in theatres if you can,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Loved it!  There were some surprises I wasn't expecting.  Feel like the ending left me hanging and wondering if there is going to be a Dune Part Three.  Hope so.,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Very good movie. Great sequel. To bad we have to wait 5 years to see the 3rd.,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Very well scripted and the actors were great.,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","I don't like sci-fi (apart ftom Interstellar). I go to the cinema all the time but had never watched Dune 1. Dune 2 looked too good to miss so I watched Dune 1 during the week and could see what it was building and how you'd want to see it on the big screen. Saw Dune 2 tonight. Wow, just wow!! Incredible. Lawrence of Arabia meets Star Trek meets Braveheart. Great cast who added gravitas to a great story. Cinematography and special effects incredible. An epic which got better and better. And just enough excellent baddie for good measure. With a third movie poised.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",What more to say. Excellent movie. 96/100,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","This movie was cinematic masterpiece, 10/10 would recommend to anybody this movie gave me chills.",POSITIVE

"Mar 9, 2024",Great movie highly recommend.,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Dune 2 was a disappointment. It didnt suck, but it was close. More like Rise of Skywalker instead of Empire Strikes Back. I watched the first one again the next day and enjoyed it much more.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 9, 2024","I certainly enjoyed this sequel better than the original. It developed the entire atmosphere in a better way. I felt that the plot line moved along nicely with a conclusion that although does not finalize the adventure as there will be another sequel, it does give us what we hope for.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Breathtakingly beautiful and the score is daddy,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Great story!  Zendaya was amazing!,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Not only one of the best science fiction movies but it feels like an all time great movie. I was blown away.,POSITIVE

"Mar 9, 2024",Lived up the hype. Beautiful story telling and encompassing scenery. Can't wait for the next one!,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","À really good movie, but the comparison with Roman empire and Arab are easily seen, and some plot remain mid, the visual are really good and mabe some scene too long but for almost 2h30 it's pretty solid",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Visual masterpiece, well acted and intelligent",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","In contrast to some reviewers, I personally found this movie to be dull and predictable. The antagonist's demise seemed too effortless, lacking sufficient action sequences. While the cinematography was impressive, the CGI fell short, though it was an improvement over the first Dune film.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 9, 2024",It's been more than 20 years I haven't enjoyed a film that much.,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","The world building alone earns this film a five star from me. The visuals are absolutely incredible and it truly does the book justice, despite some major changes. The depth of the characters and the dark message (that echoes the book) makes you realize that it is no typical action film. Yet the action is incredible. Did I mention the amazing acting and incredible score? Almost three hours, yet the time flew. Only warning is that if you have sensitive ears bring earplugs.  It is loud. You really feel the base, which a lot of people love. TL DR? See this film. Do it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",amazing!!! I want to see it again and again! finally a movie worth going to the theater for!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Great movie.  Does the book justice.,POSITIVE

"Mar 9, 2024",Can't stop thinking about how good this film was,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",I like the movies twists and turns. Yet never stop knowing you thinking who. Question is will they make another movie.... It seems like they have left an opening.,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Great movie! Incredible visuals and a great plot.,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Austin Butler proves he is not a one trick Elvis pony. He was outstanding in this film.
Zendaya just has something about her she kept on screen.
The sound effects vibrated our seats to the point that I felt a full body massage after almost 3 hours of movie watching
The special effects were off the charts",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",An extraordinary rendition of the first Dune book and an absolutely flawless film. Sublime.,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Epic! As the book deserves. Some details altered for the screen that will aggravate purists, but all in all award winning work. Its not only a visualization of the story but a great film in its own right.",POSITIVE

"Mar 9, 2024",Read the books 30 years ago and I love this movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Simply incredible. The visuals paired with the score by Hans Zimmer were other-worldly. At one point I didn't blink for over 5 minutes. Want to see it again!,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Loved this even more than the first one! Omg its amazing! I bet its going to win every award there is!,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Si le premier film de la trilogie de Denis Villeneuve fut excellent en terme de construction de l'univers de Dunes, la deuxième partie est plus riche et complexe en terme de dialogue, d'intrigues religieuses et politiques. Le visuel n'est pas moins époustouflant, la trame sonore un peu plus effacée mais non moins envoûtante. Déjà hâte au troisième opus.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",phenomenal movie in every way with BREATHTAKING SPECIAL EFFECTS and fantastic acting.  Deserves an Academy award nomination for best picture,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Movie was amazing, the theater seating needs updated.",POSITIVE

"Mar 9, 2024","This is a very fenomenal movie, for me. There are things I don't like, but I can't remember, and I can't understand which things I didn't like. Maybe its pacing, or scenery but overall I only remeber good things. And when its good - this movie is really magnificent.",POSITIVE

"Mar 9, 2024","A superb film! 
This is the first review I'm writing for a movie in my 24 years. I'm writing this review to convey how much it compelled me to leave a review and praise it. 

It's a film with a fascinating story, Oscar-worthy visual effects, and top-notch acting. I recommend this movie to any fan of Sci-Fi and Action. 

10/10 I'll watch it again next weekend (no other film has made me do that).",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","One of the best movies ever made. If you appreciate good cinema, go. If you're looking for cheap thrills and have the attention span of a goldfish and the emotional range of a teaspoon, skip.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Palm sweating perfection,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Downer ending, ""I will love you as long as I breathe"" then takes emperor's daughter",NEUTRAL
"Mar 9, 2024","I felt weird saying it for the last movie, but this solidified it. A barren, desolate, desert can be captivatingly beautiful! I thought this was a better film than the first. More story, more emotions, more action, great acting, and a better ending. The first movie wasn't necessarily something I thought I needed to watch again. This one, I will watch again!",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","So yes I am familiar with the book and storyline.  This second was like someone had read the first third of the book and then skiooed 100 pages, read a paragraph and wrote a storylie, then repeated another 100 pages, etc etc.  Dune 2 (IMAX) was very clunky.  Oh and BF Loud.  Thankfully I brought good ear protection.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 9, 2024",So good it was amazing ,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Brilliant film, while some editing was a bit confusing at times and the amount of characters made it hard to follow along sometimes it was an epic film once again. Timothee chalamets really grew into his character and had brilliant chemistry with zendaya. Paul really grew as a character showing many sides to him allowing the story to develop. The film did feel more fun and epic at times with the large scale shots which was a highlight from the first film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","This movie was spectacular. The visuals, the cast, the music, the director….. it was a masterpiece! My boyfriend and I saw it twice…. seeing it the second time was better than the first. I was in awe the entire time watching and was so moved by it all.

"Mar 9, 2024","Too slow. Good photography and excellent special effects. Zandaya over valorated. Chambers and Buttler excelen performance. Awfully edition part of the training of the medias is cutted, and definitely slow even in that action parts. Bardem good acting",NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",I just recently watched it. Here is what I felt. I felt like I'm watching a Novel unfolds it's story. That's the only way that comes to mind. Im hooked. And im eagerly waiting for the nxt chapter. I haven't read the novel. But because of this movies i am planning to. But maybe after I watched the complete movies for dune. As expected of Timothy.  I really love his acting. He's really a very good story teller..gosh. 👏 ❤️ ♥️,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","this movie was absolutely amazing could be best movie of the year. you know when there's a scene that's so good it makes you smile that's what happened the whole movie, timothee chalamet was born for this role he plays it so well. and even though it based of a book the script is written perfectly and there was no lowsy acting in this. everyone who played a part sold it so well",POSITIVE

"Mar 9, 2024","I don't understand what's happening to humanity. How can such mediocre films, full of glaring flaws, have a rating higher than 3/5 or 6/10? Almost everything in Villeneuve's Dune sequel is bad: 1) terrible acting by young actors who act like newcomers from a school theater troupe; 2) completely flat characters who are not fully developed; 3) empty pretentious dialogues - they are so lifeless that they only provoke double facepalms; 4) the almost universal illogicality and incoherence of events, as well as the decisions and actions of the characters - even if they were transferred from books, it would be possible to at least adequately display their scale; 5) extremely insignificant battles - in both parts of the film the battles are shown so poorly that I would like to call them a teaser for the battle trailer, and not the battle itself, etc. The film can only be praised for its visual design and some ""technical"" solutions, as well as the acting of the ""old school"" actors. Otherwise, this film is an almost complete failure. I love science fiction, and for me this is one of the worst films of the genre and the main disappointment of at least a decade.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Throw in the Koran and Mohammed and you have a full blown jihadi flic.  Isis would love it.  (By the way, the Mahdi is the ""guided one"" expected in Islam to reform the one true religion.) Timothy Chalumet a believable Mahdi warrior?  Not a chance.  And who cast Walken as the Emperor? His attempt to cover up his accent made me laugh.   Ok, beyond that, constant knife and swordplay when you can eradicate your enemies from space? You're kidding.  It's like bringing a toothpick to a tank fight.  Beyond that the story line was marvel comic predictable with bad guys getting their comeuppance by the knife, of course.  Should go over big in Saudi Arabia.  One star for the visuals and the worm riding.   Oh man, I need some spice…",NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Visually spectacular!  The best film Ive ever seen in the science fiction category.,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Nolan likened Dune: Part Two to Empire Strikes Back. I don't quite agree. Empire Strikes Back was another beast altogether.  But the Dune sequel isn't far apart.

Set immediately after the events of Part One, Paul has now joined the Fremen and he follows them to their home. With Freman divided over whether the Messiah exists and if it is Paul, who will ultimately save them; a plot is brewing among the Harkonnens on assassinating the Maud'Dib (Paul). 

With Zendaya getting more screentime, Chani & Paul's relationship is one of the highlights of the sequel. Timothèe Chalamet & Zendaya are phenomenal. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is at his menacing best. And Javier Bardem's Stilgar turns into someone, who believes every action of Paul's is a sign that he is the chosen one (memes galore already). Rebecca Ferguson, Dave Bautista, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgard reprise their roles with Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, Lea Seydoux joining the cast. 

The sandworm sequences were my favourite. I love the beats that accompany the device that the Freman use to call the worms. Dune Part Two covers everything in the second half of Book One albeit a few changes. And the two parts together make for a wonderful viewing experience especially for those who have read the book. Watching the world of Dune come alive has been truly mesmerising. No one could have done it better than this. #frankherbert would have been proud. 

Dune has to be experienced on the big screen (bigger the better). You will love it more, trust me!",POSITIVE

I’ve read the 6 Herbert books and some of the Brian Herbert books. My dad read the books as the came out and we were just in awe of this masterpiece. Everything about this movie encapsulated the Dune world. It’s a perfect piece of sci-fi.",POSITIVE

"Mar 9, 2024","I liked it, but thought Part 1 was better. There's some problems with this part. The middle hour is fairly slow as we go through Paul's awakening as the messiah. Harkonnen troops can fly sometimes but not when it would be really useful. Same with the weapons; they have devastating lasers in scenes, then machine guns, but then no guns at all in major battles. Just swords. Seriously? The Atreides now have an atomic arsenal hidden ""in a really obvious place coz no one will look in an obvious place."" Whoever wrote that scene should hang their head. There's no real chemistry between Timothee and Zendaya. It didn't feel real. Probably lacking a major love scene (might have been cut?) - Austin Butler as Feyd was great and overall it was an enjoyable movie.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 9, 2024",Every shot is a work of art. Superlative acting from the entire cast. Breathtaking action set pieces. Dune part 2 is a triumph of cinema.,POSITIVE

"Mar 9, 2024",The best visual movie I’ve ever seen. Way to bring so much clarity to a movie from a really detailed book.,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","It is rare for a film to meet the monumental expectations that the world has cast upon Dune Pt. 2. This film shatters all of them. In his return to Arrakis, director Denis Villeneuve flexes every directorial muscle we've come to expect from him and then some. Dune Part 2 is an instant classic, the best science fiction film produced this century, and proof that in the cinema, imagery and sound remain king. Fans of the book and newcomers to the world of Dune will be in awe of the secrets that lay waiting for them in the desert of Arrakis. While masterpiece is overused these days, Dune Pt. 2 will go down as cinematic legend, and a must see in a 1:43 IMAX if you can find one.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Movie was drawn out at times. Action scenes were great!,NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","It was okay. I don't know what the hype is, really. Maybe it will be more fun watching it on digital. I couldn't hear much in the cinema when I watched Dune 1. The same happened. The plot twists were nice, I guess. But I have seen GOOD movies that I loved get bad reviews. TBH, Dune 2 isn't that great. This whole franchise isn't...

"Mar 9, 2024","Unpopular opinion but Dune 2 was terrible. I read the books, saw the first film andI saw this in IMAX. I give it one star for Zendaya (who was great) and some of the visual effects. But whole time it just made me feel uncomfortable, sad and angry at why I had paid so much to see this incoherent fever dream. There was no humor at all. If I want a pessimistic and and angry film, then I will watch world news. The vibe is a melodramatic pessimistic and confusing plot that is barely explained unless you’ve read the books (I did), The musical score is barely even music- a combination of a call to prayer and over dramatic synthesized drums. Timothy Chálame is not believable as a messianic warrior (or any kind of fighter). And his character, Paul’s motives and powers are barely explained or explored. And the ending was changed, leaving out key events from the first book to set up the next film I presume. ",NEGATIVE

"Mar 9, 2024","Watched on IMAX.  Zendaya's ego on full display with unnecessary close-up shots and seems like her character was too prominent as a secondary role.  Bald Elvis was on full display and seemed familiar and flat.  Quality of CGI was top notch and the star of the film.  The Princess Florence need more back story, she stole the attention whenever she was on. A full on sex scene between Bald Elvis and The Spy was a missed opportunity.  Fighting scenes were great.  Timosiah was good, and seemed in tune with the character.  This film left me wanting to surf a sand worm.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 9, 2024",Best Movie of the year so far. You have to watch it!,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024",Everything good about the book and old movie is trashed in this version. It's overly bloody and I would have preferred better rock opera-esque music. I can't begin to describe how this craps on my childhood.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","I never read the books and thus found the first part to be quite confusing. Dune 2, however, was way better and less confusing. The visuals were excellent, just like in the first one. The acting and dialogue was convincing too.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Absolutely no idea what the fuzz is all about.
First off, mediocre acting even from the veteran actors, crowned with endless exposition dumps and unbelievable character development.
Second off, very stale visuals, as many scenes appear empty and undynamic. That may seem ok for the desert scenes, but also all interior sets including the blocking of the scene itself kind of fall flat, look cheap and are visually boring.
The pacing is way off deminishing any chance of building any suspension arc. It's just like someone put together random scenes from different movies. 
There are a lot of unnecessary scenes as well, whereas some other important ones got cut short.
No wonder my pal next to me felt asleep.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 9, 2024","I have never felt compelled to write a review before. I consider myself someone who appreciates cinema on a more-than-casual level. I get the chills from some music and, less often, from cinema. I got a few chills from Godzilla Minus One and consider it a movie that I liked very much. I am not a Dune or Sci-fi fanboy. Throughout the viewing of Dune Part Two, I was either holding my breath, shaking, or having cold chills. It is mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausting. I had completely disassociated with any reality aside from the screen while the movie was running. The theater was silent and motionless until the credits had ended. I was left speechless for an hour after it had ended. It is, hands down, the best movie I have ever seen.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","This is must-see. I watched it on IMAX. Every second of this movie deserves your 100% attention. If you feel part 1 is boring. Part 2 will give you more than double the enjoyment. I may go to watch it the second time.
Big thanks to the director, talented actors/actresses and all crews for making such great movie. This is absolutely a masterpiece of this decade.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","Way better than the first. This movie truly has an amazing story and will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Is it better than all Star Wars movies, NO.

"Mar 9, 2024","The whole Giedi Prime sequence was immaculate. Those “fireworks” and the scenes showing their military might was an excellent experience to see on IMAX. The scene where Paul does his first worm ride was also sublime. The views from where Paul was standing were breathtaking. I found myself at the edge of my seat the entire ride. Absolutely thrilling. I also loved the Emperor’s ship flying through Arakeeen. It’s tough, I felt the same way about Part one as I do part two, like some parts felt rushed while some felt drawn out. Pacing effectively in a dense story such as Dune is near impossible though. I’d give anything for a couple of 3.5 hour movies. Stellar movie. Chalamet was phenomenal especially in the second half. Like a mad man. Loved it can’t wait to see it again. But like Villeneuve says, I was definitely wanting for more.

"Mar 8, 2024","Possibly one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made.  This movie better win every award there is for music, sound editing, cinematography, special effects, and costume design.  The acting was also impressive and beyond my expectations from every member of the cast.  Probably deserves a best directing nod too.  Why cant every movie be this well made?",POSITIVE

"Mar 8, 2024",A Cinematic Masterpiece,POSITIVE

"Mar 8, 2024",Melhor filme do ano!!! Incrível!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","It was an entertaining film, but lacked many of the things that were present in the Dune, Part One.  The characters were such that they were not as relatable.  The sound track was much too loud.  The climatic scene did not present a sense that something important had been accomplished.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 8, 2024","Action packed adventure, which was a little hard to follow at times.  Running time a little long as is the norm these days.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","An achievement in filmmaking, Villeneuve has crafted a thrilling sequel adapting Herbet's complex character arcs. This film does not go short in any way with amazing performances all around, beautiful set design, amazing writing, and some of the best and most convincing CG I have ever seen. Cannot wait for Dune: Messiah!",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",It has become one of my all time favorites. ,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune : Part Two"" delivers an unforgettable cinematic experience. The visuals are breathtaking, capturing the essence of Arrakis with stunning detail. Timothée Chalamet leads an outstanding cast, bringing depth to the iconic characters. Villeneuve's direction balances action and emotion flawlessly, resulting in a film that demands to be seen on the big screen.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Great movie, wild visuals, pretty close to the book. enjoyed it a lot",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","This movie is a SCI-FI masterpiece, can the story be slow at some points yes, but the movie itself is a jaw dropping spectacle. I have now seen this movie twice in Imax and the experience is one of the best. The acting is beyond great and you feel like you are a part of the world the whole 3 hours pretty much. It is not for everyone and if you do not like SCI-FI you might not like it. But from a pure movie going experience I would say it is still worth giving it a chance. 5/5",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Awesome follow-up to the first one. Visually outstanding!!
Must see in IMAX!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","The first hint I got that this film might not be all it's cracked up to be was the universal almost cookie-cutter gushing of all the screening reviews, plenty enough to send the BS meter toward red, toward the words, ""bought and paid for"". The film itself did little to assuage that first impression. 

I've read all of Herbert's books. Next to the depth and breadth of the story telling in the books, this movie is like reading a stick-figure comic book of no more than 20 or 30 pages. It's impossible to understand in any meaningful way the story being--sort of--told on the screen without having read the books and, having read the books, it's impossible to see the film as truly meaningful. It's most outstanding feature is how so many cliches have been sown together into a rather bland and colorless quilt.

I think Villeneuve should have known you can't fake storytelling with intense, nearly silent closeup. Seems like a rookie mistake. To me, the film just reeks of hurried schedules and shortcuts. For all its attention to detail, it's appallingly shallow and superficial. But, again, I read the books.

But it'll make a ton of money, just like Walmart at Christmas.

There's nothing about this film that makes me want to see the next. But it has moved me to read the books again. There's that. I've already begun and world of Arrakis already seems more clear.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","I've read and loved the books for a long time. Scifi is my favorite genre, and this is my new favorite film. The changes were brilliant for the medium of the screen and for today. It has the best casting of any movie I can think of. Great acting. The direction and music and powerful and beautiful. Amazing experience.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",Great movie. Elements of Mad Max and Gladiator added in. A little lengthy. ,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",Amazing production and a MUST SEE in IMAX.,POSITIVE

"Mar 8, 2024",Just....wow. See this movie immediately! EPIC!,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Haven't had a moment in cinema, when I audibly gasped as the plot thickened. Exceptional storytelling and a dazzling spectacle.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","One of the very best films in recent memory. It is a beautiful film that will satisfy those who have read the iconic novel by Frank Herbert or merely watched the last film and waited for the sequel very happy. The story, cast, visuals, Hans Zimmer's score, and direction all come together to make something that is so very close to being completely perfect. 

Rating: 74/75 (98.7%)",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","This movie was incredible! Part 2 full of action and had great cinematography. The acting was also phenomenal, Timothée Chalamet was a perfect casting and portrayed a much more confident and matured Paul. Hans Zimmer did his thing. The CGI and visual effects were also astonishing. Overall the movie blew away my expectations after watching the first one and am hoping to see the 3rd(if there is one).",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Dune Part 2 is a groundbreaking film that combines a captivating storyline with mesmerizing visuals, creating a unique and immersive cinematic experience. The movie's narrative challenges viewers to reconsider societal structures and power dynamics, while its stunning visuals transport audiences to a fantastical world that feels both real and otherworldly. Through its thought-provoking themes and breathtaking imagery, Dune Part 2 delivers a powerful message in a visually stunning and compelling way, making it a must-see for those seeking a truly unforgettable movie experience.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Maybe it's a tad too long or slow. Maybe slight issues with bad acting. But, any negative was vastly over shadowed by how gorgeous it looks and sounds, and how many really cool moments there are. I loved it for sure!",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",this is art simply art for my dune second part leaves you with your mouth open simply a masterpiece,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Fantastic,started right off where part 1 finished , did not disappoint .
Can not wait for part 3",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Villeneuve does it again, bringing a visual feast and exciting fight scenes to the finale of his two part adaption. However, unlike the first, the second half seems to feel rushed and loses dramatic pacing, almost seeming abrupt with the outcomes and leaving much in the dark. Maybe it is to set up for another sequel, but ultimately it hurts what would have otherwise been a thrilling and awesome conclusion. Music, sound and the cast all shine even in the most desolate settings.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 8, 2024",The best movie to come out in the last 15 years. A must see for everyone. I went in skeptical and when i left the theater I was speechles,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","No film like it in the last 10 years. Cinematography, special effects, soundscape and narrative will blow you away even if you have not read the books. A must see award winning film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Personally thought it was more exciting than the book 😆 It's a solidly made movie and I have very few critiques about it. There was still a little bit of humor, but it's very deep themes and a weighty subject matter. It's beautifully shot and directed, and didn't feel like a 3 hour long movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","My spoiler-free review of #DunePartTwo:

Better than the first and structured in a way that feels like if the 2012 #JohnCarter movie was good and if #ReturnOfTheJedi had a very dark & alternate ending for Luke.

Austin Butler and Dave Bautista stole the show.

Amazing in 70MM IMAX.

9/10.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",Part 2 picks up exactly where the last one left off The visuals the costumes that action the story they plot the intensity of the film are all upgraded in part 2 part 1 was a true setup movie this one delivered on everything that part one left although I do like part 1 this was the dude movie that I was looking for in part 1 The world building the sit pieces were all phenomenal you can just see the money on the screen The special effects we're incredible they sound effects were a second to none and IMAX I'm going to go see it again just to plan to not miss one second because I did have to get up for about 4 minutes to go use the restroom I recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of movies this is what the big screen was made for if you don't see this movie on the big screen it just will not be the same so go and see it in the theaters on the big screen possible I saw it on IMAX,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","7/10. Was alright, but slow at times and had a semi confusing story",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","This movie is Big Screen EPIC!! A solid 5 starts easy!! I saw it in Dolby Atmos and the sounds and visuals are incredible. It's even better than the first movie IMO. If you are a movie fan, then this is a movie that you have to see in theaters. Go Dolby or IMAX if possible. It will make certain scenes even more awe-inspiring. This movie deserves it, and you will not be disappointed.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",An epic moviegoing experience. Villeneuve is a master of visuals and has created a world so large and breathtaking that you have to see it on the big screen.,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","The movie was great, and the 4K experience was fun, too. I'm glad I'd already seen the film once in IMAX as the ""ride"" of 4K can be a bit distracting.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Hollow, vaped and in no way faithful to the text.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",This movie is so amazing!  Im has honestly become my new favorite movie of all time!,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Special effects are very well done. It's a must to watch this on on a big screen with stereo effects. 
It however failed in comparison to last version to keep me on the edge of my seat, I think this was due several reasons; first the actor chose of Christopher Walken as the emperor really was a swing and a miss for me, I like him in other films but here I don't think he fits the role. 
Other things felt rushed, f.e. how Paul become so fast accepted with the Freeman, aswell as a lot of scene that lost any tension because any lack of consecuences was lost due to the rushiness of the scenes and the plot armor of the main characters, f.e. drinking the ""holy water"" wasn't exciting at all, and the 2th time when Paul drinks it just feels kinda repeatable. 

I was also annoyed by how Zendaya was acting in some scenes, kinda arrogant, protective, then maddly in love, then again mad, especially the last scene where Paul tells her, he will always love her but had to make a sacrifice to marry the emperor daughter's for the greater good (and save millions), she gets mad and runs away. Her intentions felt childish and not really clear, later I learned that in the books she did understand and it was a change off the books, which I really dislike.
I get that the Harkonnen are evil, but because they sometimes slit their underlings throats for little to no reasons, make the characters feel cartoonish and just a cheap way to provide us a bad character where I would prefer that they had use the screen-time to create more depth in the characters. 

Overall I did like the Dune 2, but for me it downgraded a lot from Dune 1, which I found was a masterpiece. I hope Dune 3 won't follow the same trend.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Stunning cinematography. Powerful performances. I didn't realize I had been ""woah""-ing for almost 3 hours already. Such a thrilling masterpiece. EPIC!",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","This was a great movie!!  I am a fan of the Dune books, so this movie really brought the books to life, The end of the movie suggested that there will be a Dune Part 3, so I cant wait for that",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Un film à voir d'urgence, giga dinguerie et à voir absolument aux cinéma, en IMAX de préférence 😅, les plans sont magnifiques et surtout les effets spéciaux qui sont fluides et crédibles à l'histoire, bref j'ai passé un excellent moment devant cette masterclass 😁",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","This movie was so realistic. It felt like you were sucked into the world of Dune and not watching it. But yet experiencing it. The casts were amazing, Austin Butler did awesome! Timothee did way better in this movie than Wonka! And Zendaya really captured the scene on her speeches and emotionality. The cinematography 10/10 and I will 100% be watching the 3rd one if it ever comes out!",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Just go watch it man , it felt like I was in the movie and I felt everything they felt. Its a powerful movie and the main characters killed it!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",Great cinematography. Story can be difficult to follow at times but one of the better movies we have seen recently. Certainly better than Oppenheimer.,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Just watched Dune 2. Possibly the most EPIC movie ever, in terms of sets, cinematography and score etc, but I felt the script, character development and lead performances weren't great. It lacked depth and I didn't care about any of the Hollywood stars, sorry I mean 'characters'. I love the book and I've liked most Dennis Villeneuve movies, so was really looking forward to this, but I'd only give it 6/10. Dune 1 was probably the better film and controversial opinion, but for all its flaws the 80s Lynch movie was better than both.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","MASTERPIECE WILL BE LOOKED ON AS A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE AND DESERVES TO BE, THE FIRST ONE WAS A BIT SLOW BECAUSE ITS SETTING UP THE STORY, BUT WITH PART 2 LOTS OF ACTION...ACTION PACKED!!! AND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN AS ONE OF THE BEST SCI-FI FILMS EVER (OF OUR GENERATION)",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",This is an absolutely mesmerizing spectacle of cinema. Please watch this on IMAX,POSITIVE

"Mar 8, 2024","Visually spectacular.  Musically flooring.  Dune 2's narrative of faith and against-all-odds stirs the heart.  The action, meanwhile, is absolutely delicious with enough royal infighting and martial arts to pay homage to the honored genre of high fantasy.  The cast excels at the adoption of their individual ethos and Chalamet shone with a breathtaking conflict between vulnerability and newfound strength.  This one is definitely not one to wait for the streaming, y'all.  Watch it in theaters, puhlease!",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",Maybe the best modern scifi movie. It makes the part 1 better. Can't wait for more! I'm going to see this a 3rd time on 70mm IMAX. ,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",one of the best movies ever ,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",This movie was such an immersive experience.. I can't even describe how beautiful it was. It somehow out shined the first movie even though it was excellent!! 10/10 so easy to rank. Timmy slayed.,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Magnificent, epic, and emotionally engaging.  Dune part 2 is everything you could want in a sci-fi fantasy film and it leaves you begging for part 3.  A film that can only be described as a modern day masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",Visually is just amazing ! Way better than the first part !,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Lacks depth, character development, and themes. This film is completely underwhelming. The most attractive aspect is the cast. Expect to wait 94 minutes for anything eventful to occur. Lead characters portrayed by great leads such as Zendaya receive maybe 20 minutes of screen time. The film lacks emotion, captivating characters, and explanation to many holes of the plot. The film leaves you with more questions than answers, and not in a good way. Not even viewers paid to watch the third installment of the series, should return. A disappointing feature.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",Best sci fi epic I've seen since the original Star wars trilogy.,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","The greatest fan-adaptation ever made. If you don't love the Dune books, maybe you love this movie less. I cried a lot. Will likely be my favorite new release for many years. Denis is the Dune fan's hero.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",Que filme fantástico e brutal. Vele muito a pena ver na melhor tela de cinema. Que obra!,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Very cinematic. It was one of those movies where I walked out not caring about it, but the movie was so cinematic. It was IMAX, so I recalled how many of these moments felt, and the humor blended very well with the movie as well. The end did really hit its mark. The knife scene was longer than I've seen any other duel in cinema, and that's exactly what I want. This was a really solid moment that showed how successful Dune has been. I wanted to really like the movie. I would recommend it to everyone because it hit all the right marks. It's just not my movie. I can't say I'm not a fan of sci-fi, but I think the suspense got me sleeping an hour through. I can really only remember only one flaw in the movie, and that is the future-but-then-unborn daughter's narration is completely unnecessary. I wish someone can put Florence Pugh into some useful roles as she's been pretty bleak as of lately.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 8, 2024","visually, creativily, overall stunning",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Visually stunning as youd expect. Inconsistent throughout. Liked watching a different story than the prior take on the book, but seemed that is was working so hard on setting up for a third part they forgot to focus on the last half of this one.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",Oh. My. God….its beautiful!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",That was epic from start to finish!,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Dune 2 is an absolute masterpiece, easily the best film I've ever seen. It's a must-see in IMAX for the most immersive experience, but you might want to bring some earplugs as the sound can be overwhelming. The acting is top-notch, and the one-on-one hand-to-hand combat scene is the best I've ever witnessed. It's so intense, it gets your blood pumping! If you're a fan of epic storytelling and breathtaking visuals, don't miss this cinematic gem.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Part One got me into the books. Seeing Jessica become a Reverend Mother was something Villeneuve pulled off incredibly well. Even though I knew the ending of the story, I was still scared for Paul's life. Zendaya has chemistry with anyone she stars with. Great movie!",POSITIVE

"Mar 8, 2024","Very compelling story telling: the visuals are awesome; sound exceptional; acting is compelling. If you are already a Dune  fan, you will not be disappointed.  If you did not see Part 1, Part 2 stands on it's own.  The ending leads us to wonder if this will become an ongoing franchise, which the studios of course love, the audiences, well sometimes not so much.  In summation, if you loved the movie Barbie, you will hate this show.  Proof positive in my book, that it is very much popcorn worthy.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","This movie and the one before it was visually stunning, but just not as great as people seem to say. At least to me. I find them sometimes convoluted to follow and at other times just slow. I think this movie would be better served to be 30 minutes or even 45 minutes shorter. It is a watchable fun movie, yes. But all the hype is just not there for me and I wanted to feel otherwise.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 8, 2024",I cannot wait to watch it the second time. Amazing!,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",I gave 4 star only because Feyd-Rautha doesn't have enough screen time. His character & his opening scene is the best part of the movie for me and we need more of him!,NEUTRAL
"Mar 8, 2024","Reading the negative reviews is enlightening. Telling about just how uneducated so many people are about the Herbert books. Having read them when I was a boy and finding out that the book is my exact age, I find it sad how many people no longer read. I not only read all of Herbert's books but his son's as well. 

This movie does elegant justice to his ideas. It may not follow completely or faithfully to his storyline or the look or costuming of Herbert's vision but it exceeds the niceties that Frank Herbert once put on pages. Denis Villeneuve creates a masterwork. Period. Perhaps a bit long? Maybe. But it is a story that needed to be told. And I am so glad he did not crunch everything into one movie like David Lynch did back in the 80's. It is unwatchable, now, though it has it's charms in some ways. But this is an altogether different animal. Like Comparing Adam West's Batman to Christian Bale's Rise. Not even a reasonable comparison.

GO SEE THIS MOVIE.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",As a fan of every Dune release I throughly enjoyed part 2 even though they repeated several aspect from part 1. The cinematography was on point and Pauls rise to fit the prophecies kept in line with all the previous years. Looking forward to part 3.  I suggest that you look at part 1 before you look at 2.,POSITIVE

"Mar 8, 2024","It's rare that a sequel is just as good if not better than the first movie, and Dune part two I would say was just as good as dune part one!",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Looked and sounded amazing, however the pacing wasn't as good as the first film, there was no build up to the action sequences and it lacked any kind of suspense. Paul didn't seem that bothered about his grandfather being the Darth Vader character, he was just like yeah, whatever, and it wasn't really mentioned again. Worth seeing if you enjoyed part 1, I doubt I'd sit through another one at the cinema though and Hollywood will be milking this with TV shows etc in the coming years no doubt. It's certainly not the masterpiece some would have you believe, it's more to do with the fact that it's slightly different from Star Wars and all the Marvel movies which most film goers are sick and tired of.",NEUTRAL

Sooo many golden moments but when Paul promises to not ""try anything fancy"" when he pimps his first ride on grampa worm -- faaaaaaark that blew me away,  what a ride!!!!! Goosebumps even thinking about it. Bring on Saturday rematch!!! Idon't go the flicks much but man, I'm making this movie a habit. INCREDIBLE.",POSITIVE

"Mar 8, 2024",The cinematography in this film is amazing. Austin Butler is so scary as Feyd-Rautha. Not saying that the other actors in that movie did a bad job they did an amazing job. The script that they were given is just as good as the actors.

"Mar 8, 2024","Monumental!!! 'Dune: Part Two' fire all cyllenders and provide one of the best experience that you will ever see in theaters. Villeneuve amplify all the scope of Herbert mythology and bring the best of what this universe can be. The cast is excellent, Timothee Chalamet is incredible, Rebecca Ferguson is visceral and Zendaya is a force of nature. Also Javier Bardem and Austin Bustley are great too. Overall you need to experience this movie, so far the best of the year, and also one of the best of this decade.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Phenomenal. Transcendent. Thrilling. Masterful. Drop-dead gorgeous.

At one point my heart was racing so hard and from the large soda that I started to hyperventilate.

Dune: Part Two builds on the Dune: Part One the way the Hydrogen bomb was built off of Fat Boy and the Trinity bomb. Both were epic, but one is leagues, nay - orders of magnitude, better. Dune: Part Two is the equivalent of the Tsar Bomba of movies in 2024: unparalleled heights of theater, cinematography, and storytelling. Run, don't walk, to your closest movie theater! 

And a note to those that are thinking of skipping this movie till it's streamable at home, on a small screen, pirated in low quality, or with interruptions: be forewarned of the crime you commit against yourself and the arts!",POSITIVE

"Mar 7, 2024","Super intense, genius film making with so many layers adapting an amazing book with so much lore. 
This topped the 1st film in everything somehow in its cinematography, score and sound design. Never has the sound design taken on so much life in a film.
I loved it and was totally immersed in Arrakis the whole film. I didn't want it to end. 
I'm not sure how some found it slow unless they are missing the subtleties and missing that you need to pay attention to every scene, every image, every sound as it all means something. 
That is what I love in a film. Denis Villeneuve has made a masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Dune: Part One was a great film that introduced the characters and their struggles in the war to produce enough Spice for the Emperor. I loved the first one and continue to believe it's a great film.

Dune: Part Two, on the other hand, not only continues the spark Part One set, but plunges itself into a cinematic masterpiece.

Denis Villeneuve's take on the 1965 novel puts the sci-fi saga in an awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping form of filmmaking history that it far surpasses anything else of the sort.

Austin Butler as a Heath Ledger-inspired foe is frightening, Christopher Walken as the Emperor is—I'll admit, a choice—but somehow works within these worlds.

Timothy Chamalet as the young Prince turned Messiah becomes intriguing when that switch turns on, leaving viewers wondering what kind of leader his Paul Atreides may end up becoming.

Hans Zimmer's score is powerful, the scenery is beautiful, and the storytelling is as if Star Wars met Game of Thrones.

Dune: Part Two and even Part One are modern-day classics and have certainly become my all-time favorite films. I can not wait to see what happens in the third installment, because these movies blew me away.",POSITIVE

"Mar 7, 2024","Second movie review I've ever done. 
This movie was just wow! When my husband asked me to go to the theaters with him to watch it (part one we watched at home), I was a bit weary because it's such a long movie and I knew I wouldn't be able to take breaks if I wanted to. I will say, though, that not one time during this film did I feel like I wish I could take a break or wonder when we would arrive at the end. It was gripping and beautiful from start to finish.

"Mar 7, 2024","I watched Dune few weeks before Part Two and I though it was boring. Well Part Two is a little bit better. The action sequences, the sound (THIS MOVIE IS DAMN LOUD), score, the performances of the cast (especially those of Chalamet, Butler & Ferguson) were just amazing...however the plot was just so complex and weird.

"Mar 7, 2024","Excellent movie. The rhythm of the first part was perfect. The scenes at the Harkonnens' planet were very well done. The battle of Arrakeen was too quick, but, I must say, I enjoyed a lot Paul giving his tactical orders on a small scale terrain model. I found that very realistic. I found the treatment of the character of Alia very well thought. I didn't have seen the time pass, although the film was quite long.",POSITIVE

"Mar 7, 2024","As a 9th stage Guild Navigator, I protest the exclusion from these movies. We are central to why Spice is being mined on Arakkis because it is the substance which evolved us so that we can form wormholes in space fold space. This is central to the evolution of all the Landsraad across the galaxy. Plus too many narrative changes that Arthur C. Clarke would not have approved of: Paul dissing Chauni is bs. Paul as Harkkonnen bs. Hinting Paul becoming megalomaniacle bs. The whole Bene Gesserit box testing Feyd Rautha BS!..

Some of the visuals on the big Dolby screen I saw it on were absolutely breathtaking and there were parts where I truly felt like I was in the desert. The story is strong anyway but the film gets the pacing perfectly right. Enough narrative to give depth, but ebbs and flows seamlessly between this and jaw-dropping action.

I am not one to rewatch movies in theaters (have max 2-3 times my whole life) I think this will be #4.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","This 5 star rating is a testament to just how good everybody involved was, because we didn't know the extended story of Dune and the 3-4 years wait time for Denis to get his team round the next slice which should have left us in a mad rage after two epic films, but didn't because Dune 1-100 deserve the full treatment. Put ticks next to great acted characters, cinematography, Hans on the musics, Paul's Direction of the whole ambience as pt.2 ...

"Mar 7, 2024","3hrs and I kept checking the time on my phone. Huge let down. The acting was terrible and also the dialogue just didn't cut it for me. The action CGI sequences looked amazing and reminded me of Empire Strikes Back but in a desert. The contrived Totalitarian, Colonialist and Fundamentalist bravado was also boring. Paul going on about Holy War! I did like the concept of him being a fourth dimensional being after drinking the water of life giving him the ability to see both past and future. I must admit the production design and interior / architectural sets really were phenomenal. Just overall the acting was super cringey except for Austin Butler's Feyd-Rathau. Pity he died in the end he was the least boring character in the whole movie.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 7, 2024","No doubt the world of Dune is extensive and complex, BUT where, for example, ""The Hobbit"" movie succeeded to stay true to the original story (not counting the third part of it, that what was completely unnecessary), the Dune 2nd part fails badly. 
- Stilgar is wrongly portrayed as a narrow-minded, overly religious desert fool, lacking almost any sign of dignity and intelligence. 
- The nuance that about three years pass between Paul being accepted by Fremen, missing out that has a son with Shani; has a sister (not talking from the womb of Jessica, but actually there - a child Reverend mother) and final battle are, for some weird reason, is missed out/gets replaced by ... well nothing of essence really. And that is just for the starters. 
One of the very few positive points is the character of Feyd-Rautha and yes, the impressive desert scenes with and without the Worms. 
I wanted to like this movie so much, but unfortunately I can not give it more than two stars.
If you have read and liked the book, I´d say you´ll do better skipping this movie, as it is falls short on too many fronts.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",Wow! A masterpiece that need to be seen no matter if you are a fan of science fiction or not.,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","It wasn't bad. It was competent in the source material. I still think David Lynch's Dune is a better work of art, but it wasn't bad. It was enjoyable. There were subtitles though. I didn't realize movies in the theater came in subtitles now for the hearing-impaired. I applaud that for its inclusivity, I just wish it was more clearly labeled on my ticket. Maybe it was. Either way, it got me thinking, why do I bother going to the theater any more? The food was okay. The beer was good, but I can't smoke weed in the theater like I can at home, while I enjoy the film. Why did I just drop 60 on mediocre food and a subtitled film? I could have just turned off the subtitles at home. Sorry, folks, but I think I'll be watching my films at home going forward. So long, and thanks for all the fish.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 7, 2024","The second part of the third live-action-film adaptation of the incredibly dense 1965 science fiction novel ""Dune"" by Frank Herbert. Visually stunning and technically superb, it suffers from some odd casting and storytelling choices that lead to a decidedly flat third act and frankly anticlimactic ending. This is largely due to the source material, one of those books that has often been described as ""unfilmable"". If you're unfamiliar with the source material, you may love it. If you're a fan of the novel, you'll likely find it a valiant but frustrating attempt.",NEUTRAL

Bravo cast/crew/directors and Mr. Zimmerman for such beauty when you make music.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","I still remember where I was when the first Dune movie was announced. Now, after all these years, I'm even more excited for what's to come. Before watching the movie, I read many praising articles and reviews, but none of them could prepare me for the reality of it. Dune Part Two delivers exactly what it promises - a bold adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever written. It's a tragic story of extreme superstitions that can cause even the most pure-hearted leaders to descend into chaos. The film starts with an incredible sequence showcasing the astonishing use of technology by the Harkonnens and the Fremen's insane harmonization with their planet. The Fremen take down their opponents swiftly and unnoticed, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer. The investment into the rest of the film only increases from that moment on. Denis Villeneuve has done it again and this time, he has hit a home run. Collaborating with one of the greatest cinematographers of our generation, Greig Fraser, Denis has produced a monumental piece of cinema. It not only surpasses the previous installment in every aspect but also reinvents science fiction itself. With its skillful use of practical sets, lighting, and digitized effects, this modern cinema masterpiece serves as a definitive masterclass for anyone aspiring to be a great filmmaker. Although the visual and audio effects in the movie are impressive, they do not distract from its main focus, which is the storytelling. The film follows a love story that defies all odds, as Paul assumes the role of the Messiah, Chani struggles to keep her mind clear of myths and falls in love with someone who is lost not only in the desert but in his heart as well. In the first act, Paul's character undergoes significant changes. He tries to distance himself from his mother's actions by joining the Fremen's cause to liberate their planet from tyranny. However, he remains unaware that Jessica's plan is already in progress. Despite this, the first act remains a charming distraction from these developments. The empire is in a state of despair as the Fremen successfully destroy the Harkonnen spice reserves one by one. This has pushed the Bene Gesserit to their limits, and as a result, the Baron has deployed his most valuable weapon, Feyd Rautha. The second act of the story mainly focuses on how to introduce a villain and make him memorable. And to top it all off, Denis created perhaps the greatest third act in existence. In the end, Paul finally realizes what he has to do. He takes the Water of Life and opens his mind to such an extent that he becomes aware of the destruction he is about to cause, but proceeds anyway. By doing so, he loses his one true love, yet he stands his ground in an incredible hand-to-hand combat and eventually to a holy war with him as an Emperor. Once again, Hans Zimmer's astonishing otherworldly soundtrack elevates this cinematic experience to uncharted hype territories. I highly recommend watching this film in 70mm IMAX print, if possible.
Let's all hope that Dune Messiah will become a reality",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Dune Part Two is a masterpiece! This is art that deserves to be seen in the highest quality, biggest possible screen and the loudest sound you can handle. I was left speechless at the immense beauty of this truly epic and ambitious film. It is a jawdropping and goosebumping experience. I got nothing but praise.

The film is visually stunning. Everything from the cinematography, set design, the production, makeup, costumes and the visual effects are all perfectly crafted. The cinematographer, Greig Fraser is brilliant and every film he's worked with are all pure visual artistry. Hans Zimmer is back again with the music and score, both Dune films sound really incredible, unique and just perfectly fitting. There's really not much that can be said about Hans Zimmer if you know the guy. The cast are of course excellent, with some of the best talents in the industry. 

The staggering scope of this film is truly massive and ambitious. The book by Frank Herbert is thought impossible to adapt and as one of the readers and fans of the novel, I can really say so. The richness in lore, the character work, the story and the complexity of the book is just too difficult to adapt. But here comes one of my favorite filmmakers, Denis Villeneuve. He just brought Dune to the big screen and he did the impossible job, and he sure did it very well. Dune Part One is great in its own right. It laid the ground and served as an introduction. Dune Part Two is even more epic and twice the greatness. It is the culmination of the entire Dune story and it delivered magnanimously. I just couldn't ask for a better film and better adaptation. 

Both Dune films are products of a passionate heart and a genius mind. And also, everyone involved in the film did a job well done. We not only got a brilliant piece of literature, we also got the adaptation it deserved for everyone to enjoy and be grateful for.",POSITIVE

"Mar 7, 2024","Really enjoyed it.  But left me feeling something wasn't coming together.  Have to say the ending had departures from the book that were odd, guessing to save time from a film that was already long for theaters to tolerate.  But while it was a definite lift from previous iterations of the material, it didn't come together in the final acts to this viewers satisfaction.  Perhaps this material is so vast it requires a 10 episode (10 hours) or 20 episode (20 hours) series done by someone of quality like this films Denis certainly is.  Par to Hollywood's detriment, the film spent a ton of time on female characters who were limited in book and didn't add to the total, thus wasting time that could have allowed the story to unfold better to Herbert's excellence; the author.  This film, while done to Denis' standards and quality in almost every dimension, more honored previous media's key scenes, with different final acts.  Huge fan of Denis.  I'm just not keen on the final acts here.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 7, 2024",Epic film. See it in 70mm IMAX.,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Absolute perfection. Beautiful cinematography. An amazing story made just to entertain. If Hollywood could learn from this, movies could be good again. Paul is a great main character.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","This is a cinematic masterpiece. The ensemble cast delivers a performance that is as moving as it is impactful. The music and sound hit me in the soul. Finally, CGI done right. It FEELS real.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",Peak sci-fi with masterful cinematography,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","It was excellent, spoiler alert ...Paul is painted as part villain and there is a plot shift where he kills the Baron ...not his unborn sister.  Also Chani does a runner which I cannot remember from the book ..a must see.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","I created a rotten tomato account just so I could give this movie 5 starts. As a big fan of the books, I thought nothing could top Dune pt l and I've never been happier to be incorrect. Along with the original Star Wars trilogy and the Blade Runner movies, this is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. Cannot wait to see Villeneuve bring Messiah to life.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Saw this movie the second time now.  I can see this receiving all accolades it deserves! The stunning visuals and immersive and emotional sounds (Hans Zimmer is pure genius!) make this movie a one of a kind gem! Kudos to Denis Villeneuve, the cast and the team behind this immensely astonishing film!  In my own words, I would describe this film and its storytelling like a real, vivid dream! Part of the fans now who will hope to remember and celebrate this movie for a loooong time! 🎞️👌🏽🥹👏🏽

PS: I highly recommend watching Part One first. Oh I can't wait for the third movie and see Anya! 🥹😍",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",I am seriously considering this as my favorite movie of all time. It's even better than the first one. I am so shocked and impressed. A group of 40 of us saw it and were so impacted.,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",very slow and boring until the end.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","It may not be my favorite 5 stars movie but I have this kind of feeling to had watch an Amazing experience that will not disapear if I watch it again and again. It's a real new aventure at theather as Star Wars or LOTR before it. I hope there will be more to build a New incredible saga. You may not love the story, the way it's adapted, some choices right that's my case however the experience shocked me and it's what a great film do. I think it worth it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",Impressive visuals but little suspense. Felt inevitable the Fremen would win from the first scene.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",The movie was jam packed with action! Went to IMAX to watch it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","this movie truely deserves a 5/5 rating. More spectacular and reasonably paced than the first movie. Though bit confusing towards the end - what was the emperor doing in  the Ferman land? trying to get captured I guess.. lol. But overall great movie, great casting : Javier Bardem, Zendaya, Rebacca Ferguson and Josh Brolin, all rocking it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","I very rarely give movies 5 stars, but this one lives up to the hype and exceeds it! Can't wait for part 3!",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",I'm speechless.  A masterpiece.  One of the greatest movies of all time.,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",It's just a masterpiece!,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Big fan of the novel, and I really like Dune part 1, but part 2 is NOT good! The first film followed the novel fairly closely, this one departs radically from the original story. It's been said that the novel is unfilmable; but I guess we'll never know since Villaneuve decided to re write the second half of the story so that it became a film about Chani. The movie is about 2 hours of watching Zendaya and Chalamet whine and cry about fears and feelings in a picturesque desert landscape. There are a solid 45 minutes of actual story progression, engagement and action. If you wanted to see a film about an angry looking young man named Chani and his boyfriend Paul working out relationship issues in the desert, this is your film. If you hoped for a worthy follow up to the first film, you struck out.. I don't think this even needed to be a stand alone film; since it's largely comprised of filler scenes and pointless dialogue. I think we'd have all been better served if the 2 hours of filler were just deleted and Dune part 1 was made into a 4 hour epic ala Lawrence of Arabia. Seriously, Chani and Irulan are both very minor characters in the novel; in this film, we see more of Chani than any other character (including Paul) and Irulan is much more pervasive than Gurney or Stilgar. In fact, Stilgar has become some sort of laughable ""comic relief"" character, like Dune's version of C3PO. Not sure why these decisions were made, but a ball got dropped somewhere. This film isn't a travesty like The Last Jedi, but it certainly is a disappointment.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",That Timothy Chalamet is so Hot right now. Javier Bardem steals the show. Zendaya is cold as sand,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",Only sad I’m gonna have to wait years for this series to continue!! Gonna have to turn to the books!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","At certain moments I got chills, which makes me think that this movie series has the potential to be classic material only time will tell. I personally had a great time",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",The first 40 minutes building the know characters put more moved a bit slowly. But after that the pace was perfect and story beautifully constructed. It could have been longer by 30 minutes once the story took off.,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",I love this movie🩵 I've seen it twice now,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",one of the best film in history! its absolutely cinema,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","This is a very good Si-Fi movie, We like it very much.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",Dune Part 2 was a fantastic movie with great action and amazing performances by the cast.,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",Amazing Visuals and Soundtrack.,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","My husband and I really enjoyed this movie and plan to go back to see it again In theaters. Such a great story of a boy growing into a man and learning to work hard to lead others, as he tries to put revenge and saving his new friends and community at the top of his priority- while struggling to follow his love and love of the people or 
fate. Loved every second. Great fight scenes, knives, guns, bombs and desert worms- it was amazing",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","I liked this movie.  Dune Part 1 and Part 2 now made more sense after seeing Part 2.  I never read the book(s), but it was so much better than the Dune 1984 version.  But growing up with the 84 version, I have a little more nostalgia for some parts of it.  Overall, this new version was great.  I wished they had more scenes with the sandworms.  This makes me now want to read the book(s).  Hopefully, WB will do the other books as well.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",Very good movie… looking forward to part 3!,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",Great action consistent with original book.,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","It was very dark, violent and kind of depressing. Basically, kill them all. I know its supposed to be good vs evil but the slaughter is excessive.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",An absolute masterpiece! Cannot wait to see it again.,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Como filme, sensacional, mas o final muda muito a obra original e me decepcionou bastante. Bem desnecessário depois de todo o desenrolar, fora mudanças de comportamento que não condizem com o livro. O diretor dar um novo ângulo à obra e mexer levemente, é do cinema, se apropriar é DESONROSO.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Visually the movie looked fantastic, the fight scenes are extremely well done. About halfway through the movie, I felt like the pace slowed down a little, but it picked back up. I think its a must see at least once, but with how long it is and how complicated the plot can be at times, rewatchabilitly might not be the best. Overall, great movie, best experience in theater.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","An absolute blast of a movie, visually stunning. Would 100% recommend someone to go watch it. This is the epitome of cinema as a format.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","I had the pleasure of seeing the 70MM film reel version of Dune Part 2. This was simply the apex cinematic experience. The movie is absolutely firing on all cylinders with epic scale, attention to detail, cinematography, art direction, and score all A+. The story of Dune is the greatest science books series ever written and this was a great adaption of that material in the penultimate entry to this triology.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Great job taking off from where the first movie left off. Its kinda hard to believe skinny ass timothe Chalamet is really this big time fighter, but other than that the rest of the casting is solid, story is strong, plenty of action. Love/sex could be increased, but probably wanted to draw in the children audience",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","excellent, especially in IMAX!",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","I really don't understand what people find good about this movie, it is awful.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Medio lenta al principio pero que buena película, diez de diez.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Visually this movie is stunning, and the score of this movie is equally as amazing. The storyline is very interesting, but I did feel the movie dragged on a bit towards the end.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 7, 2024",Loved it !! can't wait for the next movie,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Amazing movie, great cinematics, great sound, and a very VERY shocking twist. definitely a movie for the books.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","All actors were great, especially Timothee Chalamet
Zendaya was good too, but a little too obstinate
Hated Austin Butler's voice
Anya Taylor-Joy was only in it for 14 seconds
Did not like the ending. Didn't realize they were setting it up for another sequel.
Did not like that they letterboxed it on the BIG screen
Still, an awesome movie!",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Cinimatic was outstanding, The producer deviated too far from the books, and the ending was highly unsatisfactory in that it left out several critical feel good parts and the viewer is left with an obvious hole that probably will be filled in during a Dune 3 if such a thing ever happens.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Great visuals, engaging story, wonderful theater experience",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Filme de duas horas e pouco que parece uma hora.
Simplesmente  espetacular, principalmente  o roteiro em si.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",Filmed beautifully.  Sound was absolutely amazing.  Acting was phenomenal,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Incredible visually, with great score. Fantastic job bringing the story to the screen!  Really well done, even if you have not read the novel.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","I enjoyed the book and the 1985 film which I walked out of at the end feeling exhilarated.  Not so with this film. Yes, great spectacle, sound and effects but I found this film boring , the acting rather poor and the story was really not conveyed.  I reluctantly stayed for the whole thing hoping it might eventually redeem itself, but it never did.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",I really enjoyed the interaction and tension between Paul and Chani.  The scope of the desert.  The loyalty of the Fremen.   I thought the final knife fight scene was well played.  The ending felt a bit lacking.. hanging.. but ok.,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Very good follow up to Dune. The story has some deviations to the book, but it is still very accurate. The acting is amazing all around. The action, CGI and filming makes a very solid ensemble. The music transport the film more then you know. Quite frankly, I have very little negative to say about it. You must see it in theatre to enjoy it fully. I give it 90%. Some says it's like another Empire Strikes back. It surely has the vibe of it, but it is it's own thing.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","This a a good movie. So nice to enjoy ""free"" time from news doom and gloom. Highly recommend this movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",I feel obligated to create an account on Rotten Tomatoes just to tell that this movie is the best  have seen in all my life. Looking  forward to the part three and I'm starting to reading all book trilogy.🇧🇷,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",Cinematic masterpiece!! Can’t wait to watch it again.,POSITIVE

"Mar 7, 2024","It was very good, I really enjoyed the story line and the great special effects.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","It's entertaining, and that's what I go for.  Is it like the book, well, maybe about 70%, but the 30% that's changed, imho, very much changes the tenor of the story.  There are some very slow parts, but overall not bad.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 7, 2024","honestly, it was too long of a movie, but felt like they cut so much of the ending of the movie, I was so confused on what was happening",NEUTRAL
"Mar 7, 2024","very well written. the pacing was perfect. the acting superb.  very few weak moments in the movie. the special effects really worked well. but one fight scene in particular avoided the ""short scene"" version in my opinion.  the only way this story gets told better is by making it twice as long again. yes some suspension of disbelief is needed , but overall an excellent film.  I do feel the main actor is undersized for the role. but hard to knock his performance",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","The Atreides score that plays throughout the movie was Hauntingly beautiful
  ""I'll take your daughters hand... "" and ""Lead them to Paradise"" gave me chills
 also love this line ""what's happening mother ?""""Your brother attacks the Great Houses, the Holy War begins"" so powerful
 This was both amazing and heartbreaking to watch

10/10 Flim",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","The movie constantly kept at your feet. Never wrote and felt a movie as this one, constantly creating emotion within you even with the minimal dialogue. The cinematic  were spectacular and put Star Wars to shame feeling the story feel real.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",Snore Fest.  Timmy boy about as exciting as a wet towel.  At least Zendaya had some fire and spark.  Bardem tried hard to move it forward but was like pushing a Timmy boy rock uphill.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","Everything you wanted for Part 2 is here in this movie. If you liked the book, you will like this movie. If you liked part one, you will love part 2! Pacing is on point and action feels larger than life on the big screen.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",Very exciting....Special effects are wonderful,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Awesome, beautiful visuals. Unique, believable action scenes. Intriguing, subtle details in the places that matter. Models vs CGI works well and Venevue is a fine director in that regard. Battle scenes, lasers, artillery, and even nukes were a glorious addition I was hoping for. But umm.. don't you need to take cover from atomic blasts? Anyways, the movie is faithful to the book, which was nice. However, there are quite a few moments of amateur acting, painfully obvious 1-takes, and cheese lines. That Zendaya girl needs acting lessons, for God sakes. As for Christopher Walken, I love that guy, but, perhaps due to his age, he had absolutely zero of his past style and flair for this film. Perhaps it's time for him to retire. Even Josh Brolin seemed flat and uninspired. Maybe covid cut backs and time restraints hampered this film? Otherwise, who are these awful dialogue writers Venevue is hiring for his otherwise spectacular scifi films?? One scene, where Paul has an Asperger's fit yelling ""THAT'S NOT HOPE"" after his mother had me running to pick up his Ritalin Rx at the pharmacy. All in all, it's a must-see. But could've been more polished. Venevue doesn't do director or alternate cuts, unfortunately, so.. it is what it is. The spice must flow...",NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024",This was a PERFECT SCI-FI MOVIE! Part 1 was boring but this wakes you up to a whole new UNIVERSE! Best Sci-fi to me with Foundation‼️‼️‼️‼️LOVE DUNE 🔥🔥🔥🔥,POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024","Solid 10. Exceeded expectations all around. Must must see In theatres. Preferably IMAX. Been a DUNE fan since the 80's, and so happy I got to see this with my son. Best movie in a long time.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Best true Science Fiction movie of my life! I was left stunned. The audience cheered and clapped at the end, something I have not seen since the 80's. Blockbusters have returned!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","I like the movie OK. But Im tired of Zendaya being like a bigger part of the story than Paul Atredes. And Im tired of her sulking all the time. Zendaya is over rated, and only plays one character. The story is super dumbed down. They didnt even tell people what the Spice was about. Im not seeing part 3. I have no idea why everyone loves it. But I dont.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",In awe of this movie after watching it yesterday unbelievable. The music as well - A Time of Quiet between the storms. It's a magical piece of music from Hans. What a film! Could go down in history as one of the best ever.,POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024",Phenomenal movie.  Best I have seen in a long time.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","A more serious trip into the Dune universe. Those who liked the 80's movie with its pomp and pagentry, might find this version a bit flat. However, the effects were great and the cinematography was beautiful. Worth the trip to see it on the big screen.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 6, 2024",Masterpiece! Dune will go down in history and become a sci-fi/fantasy classic.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","After all the hype I've heard about this movie I finally went to see it today.
I can only think that because everyone says it's amazing that everyone that follows parrots the same thought and opinions about Dune Part 2 because they think they should like it.
It was beautiful to look at, no doubt, but the story left me utterly bored in places. I couldn't sit through it again. 
And others in the theatre  were actually laughing at the movie. For instance, when everyone was riding the worms and using them like buses......... people were laughing hard!",NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024","One of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen. The writing, story telling, acting and visuals are all top notch. Chalamet and Zendaya are the future of Hollywood. Rebecca Ferguson was also incredible. PLEASE SEE THIS ON THE LARGEST SCREEN AVAILABLE!!! Thank me later",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","More overhyped CGI poop on a platter! I don't know what movie any of these critics and people who are giving it rave reviews are watching but it's gotta be something other than what I saw and these people have obviously never read the books!! CGI effects wise some things are great, but for the most part it's just nonsensical and is even far off book in lots of ways. None of the actors convey any sort of conviction or belief in the parts and lines they deliver. It seems as if they just took a bunch of notable actors and had them regurgitate their lines in 1 take and said...yeah thatll do! Don't waste your time! Just stick with the original 1984 David Lynch adaptation, or better yet, read the books and imagine it as Frank Herbert intended.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Picks up right after the first and is as good as you would think. So well done between story and his rise,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Great movie. However… it's quite violent and should have been rated R for this reason. Not for the faint of heart for sure.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Loved it..Best Scifi ever,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Fantastic. A great way to develop from what we saw in ""Part One"", and it just seems like the best is yet to come.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","HOW DO I GIVE THIS MORE STARS? Timothee Chalamet (Paul) turns in an insanely haunting performance that’s subtle (until it’s not, then he explodes). Watching Part 1 before Part 2 emphasizes that slow change of Paul, pushing more that narrative that he’s struggling morally and the second he makes a choice, he leaves you chilled to the core. What an immense tear through this complex lore and history that he made look effortless. Speaking of effortless, let’s talk about Zendaya (Chani) and Austin Butler (Feyd-Rautha) absolutely dominating their screen time. I’ve never seen her look so betrayed. I’ve never seen him be so absolutely psychotic. Any hand to hand combat is absolutely committed to my memory because the three of them were at their highest peak in Part 2. I think I could word vomit about this for hours, days, weeks, months. I’ve never seen something so close to the books in my life. Bravo, Denis!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Better than part  one,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Always worried when a book I love is made into film. This exceeds any expectation. Loved it - will see again and again. Hope his film of Dune Messiah is released in my lifetime,POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024","Awesome, awesome, awesome. Even better than the first one. Part III will be unbelievable . Can't wait.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Such a good movie! Denis Villeneuve might just be my new favourite director. I've ordered my copy of the Dune book and have been listening to Dune lore podcasts all day today, since watching the film last night. It's really lit a fire under me. The movie is so epic, so original, so imaginative, so dark and weird and mysterious and captivating. The cinematography is vast and masterful. The costume design is bad-ass and hyper-realistic, as though we're really seeing what life is like 20,000 years in the future. The sound is disturbingly awesome too, not just with Hans Zimmer's huge sweeping wave sounds, but the subtle background sounds that make the whole alien nature of this world come alive. The plot is followable enough that it hooks you, but there's enough left unsaid that leaves you wondering and wanting to learn more. The dialogue too is poetic and uncliched, and the acting and the settings and the action scenes and the effects, and everything else is so cool and mystifying and intriguing. 

You know when you read a kid a story and sometimes they get so into it, that they start mimicking the actions of the characters in the story unconsciously, swinging the sword as the hero swings his? Well, I caught myself nearly doing this a few times in the cinema. Some of the fight scene's were so intense, I was flinching my legs in support. 

Just a really good film. I loved the first movie, but the second has really cemented for me how special these movies are. A Modern classic. Go watch it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","An absolutely superb movie and adaptation, as a long time fan of the book I was moved to tears by just how beautifully this brings Herbert's worlds to life. Great acting and awesome visuals with a magnificent soundtrack!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","This movie is phenomenal. I have seen it three times, twice in IMAX (highly recommend to watch this in IMAX as it is intended to be seen..) and once in standard. It has to be one of the best movies made in my lifetime that I have seen.  Although the first movie might have been slow, it was perfect world building for this movie and its ultimate conclusion.  After watching this movie and the first, it is safe to say that I want more and I will be resorting to the books to scratch that itch for dune that I have.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",This is one of the best movies i have ever watched and the best sci-fi bar none.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Exciting, emotional sequel to the already amazing Dune by Denis Villeneuve. Stellar performances, amazing music. Absolutely awe-inspiring visuals. Well worth seeing on the biggest screen possible.",POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024",I think as a 65 year old movie attendee we need to bring back intermission for restroom breaks and snacks for movies over two hours long,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Lifelong fan of the books. Delighted by this adaptation.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Great movie but not sure why most of the battles and fighting are still with swords and knives in an era of galactic travel …
The ending seems to leave the door open for a part 3. Not based on the books, I presume, and hopefully not going the same way as the disappointing ending of Game of Thrones …",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Part 2 seemed very cheap and small scale next to the first. Didn't like it.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Truly stunning cinematography and scenery. The acting was superb from everyone, as well as the buildup for dramatic scenes. I thought that the attention to detail really helped tell the story - like the focus on the sand snorkels before fighters rose from the sand for an attack, the focus on the thumper calling the worms, the focus on all of the steps taken in preparation for attaching lines to a worm in order to ride them.

I will not rate this as a perfect movie. In order to carry the storyline there were some detours from the original storyline that would have helped to define the timeframe and buildup, like the personal loss of Paul and Chanys baby boy.  But as a sequel this was a spectacular movie!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Fantastic story, amazing cinematography, and epic sound.  Try to see it in IMAX - it's awesome!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",It's a big budget movie for those who haven't read the book. Those of us who have will cringe at the deviations to the point they will wonder if the director actually read the book or just the cliff notes.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024","My teen daughters said that it was so good, but they are disappointed with the cliff hanger.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Powerful with a tremendous story that follows Frank Herbert's book relatively well.  Strongly recommend seeing it in an IMAX theater - it will feel like you are riding the sandworm yourself!,POSITIVE

The film's score enhances every scene, adding to the epic atmosphere. Overall, ""Dune 2"" is a must-see for fans of science fiction and cinema alike, offering a thrilling and unforgettable experience.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",i have to wait for Dune 3,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","The movie flows very well, making its runtime that surpasses its predecessor not only feel like it went by quicker but had me in the theater wishing for more. The acting was amazing a standout was Javier Bardem as Stilgar. He stole the show most times he was on screen even while Zendaya and Timothée Chalamet are delivering both of their best performances in my opinion. There is next to no filler in the film so use the restroom before the movie because if you step out during it you may be lost at some parts. Overall this is now one of my favorite movies and I would recommend anyone who watched the first film to go experience this one and anyone who hasn't watched the first film to watch both as soon as possible.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Dune 2.... A Sequel better than the original and just a overall Amazing story, characters and action. 
Negatives... some fight scenes were shot kinda meh. Some scenes felt like they could be cut and trim down.
Mixed... The runtime was kind a little to much but it's not that terrible but felt it could speed up a little. 
Positives... The story was TOP NOTCH! This Sequel was just as amazing as the first film. 1 new character played by Austin Butler was a badass and reminded me of Frieza. Timothée Chalamet was just as amazing in this film than the first and he definitely grew. There was 2 surprises that I didn't see coming and I was wowed. Every returning Character was great in this film especially Zendaya, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem. The action sequence were shot AMAZING AND THE VISUALS WERE BREATHTAKING! The Final battle with 2 important characters was shot amazing and I felt every impact. The ending was awesome and just left me on a massive cliffhanger and I want more now!!!
To Sum up Dune 2. It's a sequel just as amazing as the first film. The characters were amazing. The story was amazing! The visuals were breathtaking. The scope and scale amazing. All the greatness aside. The runtime could have been trim a bit and cut 10 minutes. Other than that problem. I loved this film and is among my favorite Sequels. I give Dune 2. 4/5! Loved it! See it!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Amazing cinematography and sound. A Masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Story, visuals and soundtrack are mesmerizing. Picks up right from part 1. It grabs you right away and does not let you go. So much happens that its worth watching 2 or 3 times to really absorb the plot and characters.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Part 2 is so good, it's feel like Paul was born to be a King, born to be hero, as the movie is born to be ""Lisan al Gaib"". The Lady (Mom's Paul) is a smart character too, she make me feel that all the things she've done or planed is for Paul and her daughter. Chani is Dune Part 2 have more scene than part 1 which is good. Paul finally revenge for his father and his people. As my view 
The time: 3 hours would never be enough, i can watch all day long.
The Content: Super Duper Positive 
The Music: Soooo Good
The Scene: Perfect , you can randomly take a photo and make it become your's background image 
=> You must watch as IMAX scene, it's VERY WORTH your money. And i can't wait to watch Part 3 of Dune",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Completely mediocre to me.  I thought the original movie was better. Dune 1 was also better. At times I was truly bored.  The acting was average at best - especially the lead character. Tremendous hype for this movie.  I would only recommend it if you had nothing else to do.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Enthralling story telling with fantastic scenes and music,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Dieser Film ist eine musikalische und optische Augenweide! Man möge am liebsten vier Stunden im Kino sitzen und diesen Film über alles geniessen die einzige Kritik die ich mir erlauben möge ist, dass es ein Science-Fiction Film ist mit sehr wenig Raumschiffen und keinem Weltraum. Das ist ein bisschen schade ansonsten ist der Film wirklich atemberaubend toll",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Didn't like the character changes from the book (especially Alia). There was not enough time jump (7 or 8 months with the Fremen is not enough) and the end seemed rushed/confusing. Those knowing the story well might be disappointed; those not knowing the story would just be confused. Should have been three movies TBH.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024","Awesome special effects, gotta give them credit for that! Chalamet's transition from a good-hearted guy to someone embracing the destructive fate he tried to dodge is pretty smooth. But hey, some plot bits don't quite click. First, he's sent on this crazy desert journey to prove himself, and bam, next scene, he's back chillin' with the Fremen. Then Zendaya's all grossed out, packing her bags to head North, but whoop, next scene, she's back in the South with him. Feels like the director went for a marathon movie and then chopped out some story bits. Still, cool effects and a wild ride overall!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Intelligent and engaging story about religious myths, manipulation of the masses, power and abuse of it… our 12 and 15 year old ranked it as one of the best movies they have ever seen and I agree at least visually. Great acting and since we had just seen Wonka around Christmas: wow! Chalamet is a really great actor. Not just good. Great. Theatre: Imax Berlin, Germany.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Not the be all end all of film but a solid sequel. Good action in latter half.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Dune Part One was awesome! Dune Part 2 is just draw-dropping EPIC! Everything about it from start to end was amazing, I thought I already knew the story, so it won't surprise me but I was dead wrong. The way the story was told with this movie is just BEST Motion Picture Award worthy and countless awards! This is a MUST watch film on IMAX!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Loved the photography, clever use of cinematic elements for narrative storytelling and beautiful visuals brought by Villeneuve. Epic soundtrack from Hans Zimmer. Just a great film overall. Watching it was a delight.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Saw in IMAX format and wow was it worth it, Incredible visuals with insanely immersive sound. Had me wanting Part 3 as soon as the movie was over, so good.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Great movie! The visuals and acting was top notch but the lack of proper character development keeps this from being a 5 star for me.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","A visual masterpiece, but the vibe feels very different from Part One.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",A movie of incoherent tedium.timmy the charisma of a wimp.much quasi religious mumbo jumbo.lots of beach shots and worms hidden by sand worms.did Rebecca Ferguson fall asleep face down on a newspaper?,NEGATIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Brilliant adaptation of the books.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","I like the movie a lot, but I think that's because it's such a great continuation of the first movie.  I'm not sure how it would work as an independent feature, but I'm not saying that it couldn't hold its own.  I'm saying that it's an excellent continuation of the first one.  I didn't realize the length of the film until the movie ended and I saw the time.  I never felt a need to look away or lose interest.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024","This was a great movie. As someone who read and loved Dune, this movie was a fantastic representation of the book. It doesn’t match perfectly, but all the key parts are there. I felt like I was on the edge of my seat, even though I already knew what was going to happen. There were some powerful moments that I think they did a great job of bringing to life. Action packed from start to finish, fantastic immersion and visuals.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Beautiful movie. Great soundtrack.

Because it had been so long since I watched DUNE 1, I spent parts of this movie having no idea what was going on. Definitely rewatch the first movie BEFORE viewing this one. 

But thats on me for doing a rewatch beforehand",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Dune: Part Two – 9.7 – Lisan Al Gaib. ""Dune: Part Two"" was nothing short of a cinematic marvel, truly living up to the immense hype surrounding it. Timothee Chalamet's performance was nothing less than spectacular, as we witness his mesmerizing transformation into a messianic figure. Every scene unfolds as a visual spectacle, immersing us even deeper into the captivating world introduced in part one. The meteoric rise of Timothee's character to power is portrayed with sheer brilliance, offering a captivating glimpse into the internal struggles Paul endures. The film masterfully navigates the tension between his visions of leadership and the harsh reality he faces. The seeds planted by his mother come to fruition, delivering a powerful narrative. A surprising twist involving Zendaya adds a layer of complexity to the storyline, as she becomes a pivotal force in the movie, only to be left behind when strategic alliances take precedence. The opening scenes thrust us back into this mesmerizing world, showcasing Freman battles and Paul earning respect with each step. Stilgar's role as the ultimate hypeman provides a boost to Paul's confidence, making for compelling character dynamics. The breathtaking worm-riding scene adds another dimension to the film, leaving us eagerly anticipating more encounters with these iconic creatures in future installments. Denis Villeneuve and his team have undeniably set a new standard for sci-fi sequels, seamlessly blending storytelling, pacing, action, romance, and suspense. The exceptional acting, seemingly flawless casting choices, and the overall cinematic experience make ""Dune: Part Two"" an unparalleled journey. As good as advertised, this film deserves a spot on your must-watch list. Head to your local cinema and immerse yourself in a world that transcends expectations.  I strongly recommend experiencing this on the big screen, official sundaynightstreaming rating of 9.7",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","A beautifully faithful adaptation of Frank Herbert's thrilling novel! Timothe Chalamet, Zendaya, and Austin Butler lead the next generation of young actors, while Stellan Skarsgrd, Rebecca Ferguson, and Javier Bardem give some of their best performances to date. The visual effects are amazing, and the action scenes are so well done. A morally grey movie that makes you think, but one that will thrill you. Oscar nominations are on the way for this movie! Bring on Dune: Messiah!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",This movie is good in every perspective,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Plot was pretty in line with the book. Good action and CGI. Sometimes background effects were so loud you couldn't hear dialogue,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Best movie of 2024. Would love to watch the third part!,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Absolutely phenomenal. One of, if not the best sci-fi movies of all time. Such great execution. Cannot wait to see the next one Denis Villeneuve has in store for us.",POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024","Beautiful, entertaining, Cinematic, on every front this movie is a masterpiece",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Rather boring. So much droning, overly dramatic music but too little action.  I felt this movie was just a filler to get from Part 1 to Part 3.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Great movie! Saw it in IMAX, seeing again in IMAX. Do yourself a favor, see it in IMAX, you will be blown away.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","NO SPOILER REVIEW 
I love movies that I can watch twice! This movie, as well as the first,  is a movie that can be watched multiple times. While still maintaining the interest and amusement. 
I see this franchise becoming the next ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings"". With each movie ending in an anticipation for the next one. 
This particular one was more of a romance genre. However,  it packed enough action and adventure that it kept me locked in. 
Most movies in theaters are predictable and can get strung out. However,  this is not the case. I found myself gasping at a particular point and that never happens!  The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 star is how it ended. It needs more closure in case a third never comes out. Then we'll be stuck creating our ending. 
Don't miss out on watching this movie on the big screen. You won't be disappointed!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Well done. This movie is a masterpiece,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Continuing series.  Like Starwars.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Took my Daughter to see this and she LOVED it! ""Now I gotta see Part I!!!"" Haven't seen her this excited about a film  in a while. What can I say? After almost 40 years since David Lynch's film adaptation, fans of the 1984 film and the book finally get a film franchise worth spending money on. Definitely going to see it again in IMAX next time.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","One of the best movies I have ever seen, and likely the greatest sci-fi movie ever made.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",The movie was better than Dune 1.  Action filled and a little sad in places.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Please, Please, Please Continue this saga with this director. This kind of film making gives me hope for the future of movies.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",absolutely gorgeous movie. everything was so good. it's not the book but it's a wonderful thing of it's own.  hopefully we can get a third.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Great special effects!  Good transition of Chalamet from a good heart to one who is accepts the destructive fate he tried to avoid.
However, some of the plot elements don't hang together. (1) He is asked to go on a long, treacherous journey through the desert to prove himself, yet in the next scene he back with the Fremen again.  (2) Zendaya is disgusted with him and pack her bags to go back North, yet in the next scene, she's back with him in the South.
Seems like the director made a longer movie, then had to edit out parts of the story.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","By far one of the best films, I have ever seen in theaters. Blown away.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","A cinema experience unforgettable. The sound, score, visuals everything was perfect",POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024","Smart, cool, gorgeous.  Nearly everything about the film is stunning.  The deviations from the book are totally forgivable.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Grand is the word. I'd definitely be up for Part 3, which you start to anticipate about half way through, given it's actual pace. The journey is highly engaging and stunning to look at though. There were however some odd scene shifts and dangling plot lines and if anything, the film increased my admiration for the unfairly maligned David Lynch effort which covered the same material and more in a single film. Highly recommended however.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Lots of fun.  Only minor quibbles from one of my favorite novels.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Just seen this movie and it might be one of the coolest movies I've seen in the last few years. The cast is perfect, almost every great actor which Hollywood has. It's very well-directed, shout out to the director.

The only thing that I didn't like is how long it is, I think it's extended to eternity.

In conclusion, it's a must-see—absolutely the greatest sequel.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Saw it twice in IMAX, boy i never had goosbumps like this watching a movie. This is PERFECTION in every sense of the word. Watch it in cinema, enjoy life",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Epic in every way, while still spending time on the characters and making sure there's emotional stakes. Not flawless, but a dang good time at the movies and the most gorgeous movie I've ever seen. Villeneuve hits another one out of the park.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Trust me, this has been the most captivating cinematic experience I've had all year. Denis Villeneuve has truly surpassed himself with this masterpiece—a remarkable coming-of-age creation. The cinematography is nothing short of enchanting! Greig Fraser's visuals are stunning, as always, demonstrating his mastery behind the camera. While all the actors delivered commendable performances, it's Paul and Zendaya who truly shine, their chemistry resonating effortlessly.
All that being said, the film is visually breathtaking. If you enjoyed the first part, you're sure to love the second. This is a cinematic journey you can't afford to miss; make sure catch it on the big screen.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Greate combination of story and technology ..
While sci-fi movie are mostly depend upon vfx ,dune part two give you chance to see mesmerizing collaboration of character building , acting skills ,story telling and nevertheless mind bongling ,larger than life size vfx and cinematic marveolous",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Best movie I’ve seen in a long time!!! The sound effects and cinematography are incredible!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Villeneuve shows that he is a genius in being able to adapt the Dune books to the big screen effectively. The visuals are spectacular with great performances from the cast.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","I had so much fun watching it. I liked the quick plot, realistic battle scenes, subtle conflicts on the love front, the emperor's shaky authority and fall, and the complete disappearance of rival forces. I'm looking forward to part 3. In particular, the process of becoming a Fremen and the siege of Arrakis will likely remain in my memory in the future.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",The nearly three hours can be a little exhausting but the effort is compensated quite well by the development of the plot and characters; and it's a blessing that you don't have to read the original book to understand everything. Waiting for the next chapter?,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","It shouldnt be called part two, because it was a sequel to the first, it was the same movie , just redone. Dune- redone!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","The second half of the book is better than the first, and while part one was great, this is breathtaking. Just like in the book, once the Fremen arrive on the scene things really get interesting. What an adaptation. This is a stunning achievement by Villeneuve. Amazing casting, extraordinary effects, the soundtrack is astonishing and the action doesn't let up, all the while staying so faithful to the original story.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Amazing story, music and visuals! Loved it!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",'Great adaptation of the book.  Somedetails were ommitted for the movie.,POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024",This is the greatest movie I have ever seen in theaters. Hands down. From the acting to the score and the cinematography. I can’t remember any experience that has come close to this. Go see this movie!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Constant action, outstanding effects.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",The first movie gave me hope that someone other than the TV miniseries might honor the writting of Herbert. This movie ruined that for me. Not even close to the book.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","This movie went hard from start to finish, so much character development and story to see in this film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Best Sci Fi movie I've ever seen, probably the best film of 2024. I bet it's definitely gonna snatch up some Oscars. The only thing that took me out of it was Christopher Walken's portrayal of the Emperor. Other than that, fantastic film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","For fans of the series, the display of this one was excellent - solid amount of storytelling and charecter development - good balance of action and conversation - i thought their were some parts that could have used even more background but the movie would have had to be another hour!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","One of the best films I've ever seen in my life, especially as a fan of Frank Hebert's work, even with some changes I thought it was a very sensational film!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Keeps you on the edge of the seat for it's whole run time. The characters are fleshed out. Each frame of this movie was made with love for the craft.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","The comparison between the two movies and the book is unfair. The book is much better than the movies. There's no denying that. The first part of Dune was a reasonable adaptation. This second part was a very good adaptation. However, beyond being an adaptation, Dune, part one, was a good movie, whereas this Dune, part two, was a very good movie.
If we stick to the film as an adaptation, it will lower its rating, but if we focus on the film as a pure and simple cinematic work, it's a great film and surely, if not the best film of the year, it will be among the top 5. It's a movie to be seen and rewatched in the cinema at least twice. It's genuinely good!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Lisan al Gaib! Very EPIC MOVIE! Ganyan dapat mga movies ngayon. 10/10 overall. I also like the cinematography👌p,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",It was so good. I love the changes Denis incorporated. The actors performances were fantastic. I was almost out of my see at during Pauls speeches.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",The Muad'Dib of the Sci-Fi movies. Thanks Denis Villeneuve for this great adaptation. It is already iconic.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","A masterpiece of the sci-fi genre.  Villenneuve continues to show he's one of the great directors of our generation and one of the great sci fi directors of all time.  The cinematography and sound are spectacular, the whole cast is fantastic and Timothee Chalamet transforms into the true movie star of this era.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Saw the fan premier and I've read all the books, a lot of major story line changes but they are done in a way for everyone to be able to follow along without it being over complicated. Amazing film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Destinada a ser un clásico de la ciencia ficción al igual que los libros. Película superlativa. Filmación de alta calidad y efectos especiales notables. Música y actuaciones buenísimas. En los aspectos a mejorar existen ciertas diferencias con la novela que eran innecesarias y faltó desarrollar más la evolución de Paul en MUad dib.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","In the end, this can only be described as a no-holds-barred romp ..... Director Denis Villeneuve jumps into what could easily be a sequel to the by-the-numbers franchise and creates a feast for the cinematic senses!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","As someone who loves the books I can say the film made an excelente job. They were able to cut of some parts that were a little bit slow to ad more action without losing the soul of the story. I didn't like what they did to Alia, but the movie is so good that I barely missed her. Amazing soundtrack, the time flys. It's just an outstanding job.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Brilliant!!! Epic!!! Visually Stunning!!! A treat for the senses!!!! A Cinematic masterpiece. Sets the Bar for Science Fiction movies. A truly immersive experience that transports you for nearly 3 hours to another world. ""A"" Listers brought their ""A"" game!!! Testosterone and Estrogen oozed off the screen. Battle scenes and hand to hand combat to rival anything that came before it. Truly a creative spectacle to behold. No disappointments here. 👍🏾👍🏾⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024",I had forgotten how violent the book was.  The movie has lots of combat and other violence.  Not many peaceful characters in this movie,NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024",Epic and amazing! This is what we go to the movies for. ,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","A true masterpiece of cinematography. From the gorgeous wide shots of Arrakas deserts to the close shots of heated battle, Dune Part Two holds up and surpasses the first installment of the Dune franchise. With a runtime of 2h 47 mins I felt every moment was used perfectly, I was left wanting more at the end of the movie. More of the Emperor, more of the Revered Mother, even more of Feyd-Rautha.

Hats off to Chalamet who gave a award winning performance and left me in no doubt the hopefully further movies in the Dune universe will be just as awesome. A must watch for any lovers of Sci-Fi and the grim reality of a universe spanning empire.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Long movie but not a boring second.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",It was amazing experience to watch this movie on theatre,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","A must-watch, especially on the biggest screen!
Fair warning: It's not really a family movie. It is not Star Wars, as in the lines between good and evil aren't all that clear. With that said, it is a very honest portrayal of how a theocratic empire rises.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","I legit don't understand why people are saying this movie is that great. I've got so many questions, first off, why do they fight with swords if they have laser weapons and rockets? Also, what's up with the Batman voices? Why does everyone speak like Batman? Because they have dry throats? Also, people will hate me for this, but Zendaya her acting is not great to say the least in this movie. 

The first movie was good, but I created and account on Rotten just to say that this movie isn't as good as people say it is.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Can there be such a thing as a perfect film? Dune II is a masterpiece!,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",An absorbing cinematic experience. This film is a must see masterpiece. The stunning visuals take you deep into the world of Dune. Amazing cast!,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",A must-watch in Dolby / IMAX cinemas,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Utterly. Stunning. The best possible adaptation of this work (even despite it's sometimes radical deviations from it). Powerful. Visceral. Kicks the legs out from under you. Terrifyingly relevant. Greatly exceeded my expectations. All the stars.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Have you ever watched a movie that made you wonder how you can possibly continue your life without being involved in the world that the movie has sketched? Dune 2 is a gem of a movie, and should serve as the GO TO example of how fiction is done well.

The only flaw with this movie is that it isn't 2 hours longer.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",A scale and story I haven’t seen the likes of since LOTR Two Towers! It was absolutely amazing!,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Even more visually dazzling and fully realized than its predecessor, Dune: Part Two sets a high bar for science-fiction filmmaking and director Denis Villeneuve's future projects.",POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024","This was pretty close to the original, not as good as the old one on acting, but still better than part 1 of this trilogy. But its more action and modernized so that gets it some points there, and a few different takes on the book and original movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",One of the best films ever made. Pure Cinema Masterpiece. enough said.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Not sure how to grade it any other way than 5/5 but wish i could go higher! A triumph of cinematography, world expansion, and direction. Timothy comes alive as Paul and Rebecca Fergeson is a perfect villain. Honestly - just please see this in the cinema.  Total subversion of the chosen one trope, the epic battles were not exhaustive. I loved it.",POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024","When Part 1 came out, the parts left put made sense and i had hoped would show up but with Part 2 the story has been changed from the book and that left the movie dissapointing such as still no spacing guild, no Alia, Paul amd chani's relationship story was changed as well and the time was compressed in which the war on the harkonens was shortened. Overall a passable movie but with the change in story from the book, I was dissapointed...Worth watching the one Time but that's it really...",NEUTRAL

Please see it on the big screen - X - Imax - XD .  Go on the bargain day soon if need be. This is what movies are about, Big stories on Big Screens ( with big sound systems) Zendaya is actually good in it. In part one she wasn't in my opinion.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 6, 2024",Movie is PEAK Cinema. A must watch film.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Incredible on so many levels. I haven't read the books, so there's that. Unlike many, I appreciated and enjoyed the pace of the first hour. I would have liked to see it [the pace] continue throughout the rest of the film. Yes, I would have sat through [and enjoyed] a longer film. I thought they should have taken more time to rally the troops and takedown the powers that be. Felt a bit too quick, a bit too easy. The baddies seemed more shrewd, calculating, and ruthless in the first part. Less so in the second. In other words, I wish it were a series. Having said all that, I really enjoyed the film and will see it again. So many impressive elements! SUCH a good time at the movies.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Excellent continuation of Dune. Excellent story. Great acting and a beautiful movie to watch. I was on the edge of my seat much of the movie. I can't wait for part 3! Definitely go see even if you missed part 1, but I suggest watching part 1 first.",POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024",I don’t rate movies but this one is different. Dune part 1 perfectly sets up this movie to be the climax so far in the story. The level of immersion in this film is unreal. I recommend watching it on IMAX in the center of the theater for the best experience. sources - (trust me).,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","One of the best movies I have ever seen. I am racking my brain to think of a movie that I have enjoyed as much in the last 5-10 years. The cinematography is gorgeous. The score is amazing. It is reminiscent of lord of the rings, game of thrones and star wars, but would never be mistaken as a ripoff. Deserves every bit of praise that it is receiving.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",This is an extraordinary movie in every sense. The way it deals with the issue of faith and power is just incredible.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Absolute worth watching, riveting ,",POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024",Literally wanted to walk right into a second showing and watch it again!!  Fantastic!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Denis Villeneuve does it again! This is DUNE at its finest. The film was absolutely a blast, from the acting to the soundtrack this film was the complete package. Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya absolutely are stunning. Balancing a beautiful connection that pours out into this film. Action sequences and fight scene had me begging for more. In the words of Christopher Walken "" I got a fever, and the only thing that can cure it ..is more DUNE""(*not actual quote). I wouldn't be surprised if this didn't get film of the year easily.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",This movie is blow away and the epic scope and acting are perfect. Definitely see it on the biggest screen possible,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",A lot more action than the first. Must watch,POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024",Its been decades since a part 2 of a movie hits the mark for me and this was it. I cant believe we waited so long but it was so worth it. Perfectly done!,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Dune: Part two was amazing! Just when you think the producers are going to cut the movie and make you wait a few years for part 3 it keeps going! Picked up right where it left off plus more! The movie is full of action, adventure & some major plot twists! I will have to catch it again! Highly recommend! Go see it!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",It has big worm energy,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Must see very well scripted and done this is what Star wars should have been could have been and wasn't,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Before I went to the movie yesterday, I watched the 1984 version and then the 2021 version so I was all prepared for the background of part 2! 
I loved the movie and the cinematography was fantastic. Can't wait for part 3 and I hope I'm still alive to see it because I turned 82 yesterday!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",A visual feast. Crew probably still shaking sand out of their shoes. Austin Butler stole the show.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Best and longest movie ever! Engaged the whole time and the plot is magical.,POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024","Ive read the books, seen the first DUNE movie, many times, seen DUNE pt. 1 several times, and just watched DUNE pt.2, I was amazed with the visuals, acting, and following the original story.  GREAT MOVIE, I need to see it again, Its that goof!

SIX Stars!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Only not 5 stars because it was a touch long!,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",OMG! Part 1 moved slowly and this was no better. If you did not see Part 1 you will be lost and if you are thinking about seeing Part 1 just pass.,NEGATIVE

"Mar 6, 2024",Great movie I really enjoyed the first and this was better ,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Minus one star for playing with the chronology and characters and minus one for neglecting the weirdness and other major worlds and groups in the first book of this universe. Should have been an HBO series.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024","Pretty intense, very loud, sometimes hard to understand the words, but very good!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",This movie is like the dark knight to Batman begins,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","This movie fixed everything wrong with the first movie… and somehow with a plot so thick with sub-plots, everything feels so clear. Almost three hours and I wish it was longer. Can't wait for the next movie if it's green lit!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Best Movie of 2024 i know is early however is goint to be hard to see a better movie this year or maybe in the next couple of years.,POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024",Sooo  long!  An the volume was so high!,NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024",(Insert martin Scorsese cinema meme),POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","did not live up to the promotions of expectations... copy the voice of batman,,, trick, infra red filming unique for sure... relies on special effects, which were good... a bit overdone and under acted... very entertaining for sure... but not a home run.... a little slow paced.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024",Most entertaining movie our family has seen in a LONG time!,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Very long but a huge improvement over part 1!,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Intense and epic.  Visually stunning.  Featuring some of the biggest new and old movie stars.  Dune is a book that needed this movie.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024",This movie was so epic! Great follow up sequel.,POSITIVE

"Mar 6, 2024",Stunning visual and sensory experience.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",I had so much difficulty understanding the dialog that I left the theater an hour into the movie. I didn't know what was happening and it was frustrating. I may watch it again when I can have subtitles.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Book nitpickers may disagree, but I found it a great rush of action and character development (after the first half hour).  I felt genuine chills at times, and that is saying a lot at my age.  Despite a huge number of deaths, there was little blood.  Highly recommended.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Best cinematic experience in years!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Gives me Faith in Movies again! A+ 💯,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Superior follow-up to a masterpiece. Unforgettable IMAX experience. Beyond expectations.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","This movie meets or exceeds expectations for nearly all moviegoers.  The acting and the visual masterpiece that Denis Villeneuve puts together are mesmorizing.  Fans of the Dune series will likely leave the theater asking themselves, ""Dune without the Spacing Guild, what is that exactly?""  There is a reason why, ""The Spice must flow"".  Taking liberties with the story line by omission is OK I guess, but no Spacing Guild?  Really?",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","I have to say that I was disappointed and left wanting. Too many things were left out and glossed over from the novel. It feels like they missed the point of the story. They replaced dialogue with stunning visuals and overwhelming sound. They did not do enough with Paul and Chani's relationship, the loss of their first son, or Paul's reluctance and final submission to accept a destiny that he feared. It was like watching Anakin Skywalker fall to the dark side and submit to a life he did not want, but was fated to perform. The movie should have felt like the ending of a novel, concluded, but the film left everything unfinished for the 3rd film based on the 2nd novel.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024",Excelente. la disfrute de principio a fin.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Hands down one of the best movies i've seen in over the decade, Denis Villeneuve is a master at his craft while Timothy & Austin as well as the rest of the cast are exceptional, five stars!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",One of the best movies of all time,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Dialog was incoherent for the most part. Much of it whispered or mumbled. What wasn't was often in some sort of fake Farsi with subtitles that went by too fast to be read. And the talking was endless. Mostly nothing happened. Could not follow the plot because I could not tell who was fighting who and it was just preposterous. Why with all their tech are they fighting with blades? I read the book. Part 1 was OK. I kept having to look at my watch. It was a waste of my water.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",It was fantastic! Didn't mind the few liberties taken with the story.  Looking forward to seeing it again!,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","As far as visuals go the film was spectacular and some of the scenes were really well crafted.
It is difficult to compress the Dune universe into a film for sure, some scenes were presented without explanation but I think hoped the audience would just accept what's happening without questioning it.
Chani is the worst character though, she has only two facial expressions (😤+😠) and added very little value to the story, Rabban has only two volumes (shouting and kissing feet) but the casting of Fayuab (the other bad guy) was a masterstroke.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024",I found it to be very well made. The actors were great! The special effects were on point. No complaints.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Awesome film.  Great special effects, Chalamet was terrific as Paul and Zendaya was great.  Marvelous adaptation.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Watched it today. It is a visually beautiful movie and the special effects are top notch. I know it differs in some respects from the novel but I read it so long ago that I cannot recall every specific thing. I guess there will need to be a part three since so many things were unresolved at the end.

I will confess that I felt that having Christopher Walken as the Emperor  was a serious miscasting of that role. In addition, that whole scene made very little sense since you would expect the Emperor to have better security.

All in all, a good movie, entertaining, and it had Rebecca Ferguson :)",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Magnificente film! As a reader of Herbert's books, Denis Villeneuve exceeded expectations in adapting the first book. I eagerly anticipate him making a part 3, and indeed succeeding in this storyline, finally showing the dangers of religious fanaticism.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Excellent film. Engaging with the storyline.  My friend and I enjoyed Dune: Part Two to its fullest. Thank you very much for keeping movies exciting to partake in.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","This is why we go to the cinema, to be carried away and surprised! I expected to see a very good film, I left having seen a masterpiece. The same feeling as after seeing The Empire Strikes Back, with the desire to know what happens next and the desire to watch this second part again and again",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Absolutely breathtaking beautiful film,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Brilliant, breathtaking!  All the negative reviews about this film are due to a misunderstanding of the story itself (it seems too complex for too many people already)... or simply written by people who don't appreciate beauty, creativity  and the art of cinema.  It's simply a masterpiece!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",every timothée chalamet movie is amazing and this was so good in the visuals the story the characters everything was amazing must see,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",I have never sat in a movie theater and felt on the planet. Dune is a masterpiece of sound and epic scale. every act is better than the last. The entire cast is perfect. the entire score is perfect. this is absolute cinema,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","My five word review:

Cinema as it should be.",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",No hay palabras suficientes en el español para describir lo increíble que es esta película.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","While the first movie felt like strictly story building to me, part two is far more of an epic. There is plenty of story and action, leaves you wanting part three immediately.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Sin lugar a duda Denis Villeneuve es un gran director pero como todo hombre cuando quiere ser perfecto pecan de soberbios, arrogantes y orgullosos, y les pasa a todos los directores q siempre salen con que quiere poner un poco de su talento cambiando o alterando los hechos de una novela ya creada, Dune una super novela de ciencia ficción que ha sido recreada en película y serie siendo está última la mejor q se apego a la novela, está era magnífica oportunidad de superar eso pero no lo lograron ya que el argumento final de Dune 2 lo destrozaron, porque no pusieron a Alia quién es la q verdaderamente mata al Barón Harkonnen, esa trama de enojo de Chani nunca fue clara y no tiene nada de sentido, cuando en la novela siempre está del lado de Paul, que paso con el primer hijo de Paul q es asesinado por los Harkonnen y Sarukan cuando el emperador llega a Arrakis, son aristas o detalles muy importantes que tenían q ser incluidos y que dificultarán el montaje de la parte 3 y que prácticamente ya no se basara en la novela xq apartir de este momento todo el argumento tendrá q ser inventado todo por no seguir el librito ni modo ahorita si tenemos una película con buenas secuencias de batalla, muy buenos efectos , muy buena fotografía pero la trama de la novela alterada y muy mal llevada en su conclusión.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","They did it. Finally, Dune done right. Just about perfect.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Very entertaining a lot of action throughout!,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",One of the greatest movies I've see . Easily the best film to come out in the past decade. Simply stunning. Unbelievably entertaining. Just fantastic.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Not sure how to understand it or exactly what angle to see the movie from.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","One of my favorite movies of all-time. Truly epic, exhilarating, and layered science fiction at its absolute best. It took me a couple days to just come down from the experience.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Three words: piece of Art!! Purely flawless film, either plenty of action, character development, story building, and so much excitement left for the third film of the saga, simply outstanding.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Best move ever made, IMHO. This is an accurate depiction of the book. And the cinematography is sublime, as is the acting, soundtrack, SFX, sets, direction, production.... I could go on. The storytelling is perfect, and exquisitely paced. Timothy Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides is mature and believable, but Javier Bardem steals the show as he does in the first movie. There are slight comical elements to his character, but in a good way that does not spoil the mood.

This is a must for sci-fi fans, or anybody who enjoys a proper, classic movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Fantastic. Haven’t seen an epic like that since return of the king.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","It was a good action film, they may have tried to put too much into the film because it jumped a bit without explanation! Otherwise I enjoyed it!",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",The Visuals are Good but I'm not gonna lie the Dune movies are so boring. Some may like it and that ok! My opinion is it just drags on for almost 3 hours and all they did was fight in a desert the entire time.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Plenty of action  great story line.  Actors were awesome. Cant wait for  part 3!,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Amazing special effects compared to other modern movies. Great soundtrack too.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","masterpiece.  
slight changes from the book, but expected in a movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Loved it. Was much better than the original.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",This movie is so good I'm obsessed.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",I loved the movie was captivating the entire time I think Timothy deserves an Oscar.!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Well made, awesome sound n visuals...no mindless kung fu'ie loo'ie, deeper story. There better be a part three!",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","A sci-fi movie like no other, Dune Part 2 is exhilarating. Who knew a world of sand could be so visually rich? Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Florence Pugh, and Austin Butler all put in award worthy performances. Dune Part 2 is likely to be a movie that will be talked about for many years in the category of greatest sci-fi films and sequels.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Visually stunning with amazing music. Hard to take your eyes off the screen and some real emotional moments with genuine jeaopardy for many of the characters. Can't fault the acting with some powerful performances, particularly the female cast. Can't wait to see it again.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Best movie I have ever seen. 100/10,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Great movie.
It came full circle and has met and exceeded expectations.

I hope the series continues!!!",POSITIVE

"Mar 5, 2024",Everything was insane! Such a masterpiece,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Amazing movie it was a masterpiece of a movie. Better than the first one.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","🤯🤯🤯 MY GOODNESS, what a film!!! Dune Movie Part Two is the film I wanted to keep wanting more!! You don't feel the almost three-hour cinematic experience!! This type of film is why you go to the movie theater, and they exist for this visual and complete story immersion!! Outstanding storytelling, acting, and music score! I would love to see this in IMAX for a second view and I would love to chat with people about it! I highly recommend it! This film could be watched as a stand-alone, but honestly, watching both films back to back is a cinematic experience you truly want to check out! 🤓🤩",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","It was great movie, its long hut I never felt bored",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Choppy editing, decent watch once movie series. When Dune 3 comes out, I think I'll pass.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","A fine follow-up to the Part 1 that dragged a bit in the middle and then wrapped up in a rushed finale, Part 2 falls a bit short of Part 1.  The pacing was uneven, with the middle a bit bogged down and the finale feeling quite rushed.  Walken felt like a weak character, while Charlotte Rampling continues to carry the Bene Gesserit cult along with her menacing character.  Rebecca Ferguson's character arc was perfectly done.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",I can't wait for the next one!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","After really anticipating Dune 2 we were sorely disappointed. If you are a Frank Herbert fan of his Dune series, this is a far cry from them. Not sure why the writers/producers/directors felt the need to change this dynamic story so much that it wasn't Dune. If you just like a big, sweeping sci-fi, then this knockoff is for you.
 The characters were anything but in tune with each other. Alia Atreides Doesn't even appear as a child when her grandfather is about to die?! Chani is a spoiled brat that never bothers to become a Sayyadina, and the Harkkonens aren't red headed - just pale blobby people. If you enjoy tearing up classics, then this mess is for you. There is a lot of explosions and special effects, so for those who really enjoy eye popping EFX over strong storyline, go for it. I, for one found this movie a waste of time. If you enjoy Dune, the book series, I highly recommend the SyFy three parter, Dune, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. Even though this version had light haired Caladan characters (instead of the dark-haired as depicted in the book and the Atreides twins are portrayed much older), this was a much closer adaptation to the first three books.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","WOW the movie just gets so much right with the visuals, the acting, the tone, and the musical score. It's epic, it's entertaining, it keeps your eyes glued to the screen. I didn't even notice the almost three hours runtime until the credits rolled.  My sci-fi agnostic girlfriend couldn't wait to see it again before we even left the theater. 

I read the book way back in highschool so it's not all super fresh in my mind. I'm sure there are tons of inconsistencies and minor details changed for the screen adaptation and there is a little bit a barrier to entry with the backstory but I feel like the also exceptional Dune part one sets it all up perfectly.  

See it on the biggest and best screen you can, but if you can't get your prime viewing seats I'd wait for a later, less crowded showing. All those poor people in the front row will need neck braces after it's done",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Faithful to the book and much better than  part one!,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","This movie had many moments that moved me. Numerous chilling moments of what a little faith in something or someone can move others to do, think, or feel. Great movie all around.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Im a Christopher Walkin fan but feel he was miscast here. It was a distraction. 
Zendaya did okay but spends a lot of time just frowning. The rest of the cast was excellent. 
The sound effects and music should win academy awards- they were amazing and made the movie.
Ive never read the books but the director did an excellent job making the stories cohesive. Loved it overall.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",One of the best cinema experiences I’ve ever had. Brilliant movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","It's an objectively pristinely crafted film. This is cinema at its finest. One shouldn't experience this on a 40 inch tv for the first time. You really will thank yourself for seeing it where it was intended to be seen. Everything comes together in this film. The cast, perfect. The score, perfect. The writing, perfect. I could list more because everything is perfect. Great films exist but rarely do we get a convergence of brilliance like this. It's, in my humble opinion, the biggest milestone in cinema. I don't say that lightly like you may assume.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","I went in expecting an amazing movie coming from the first one and reading the book, and it blew my expectations out of the water!",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",As good as the first.  Worth watching at least twice.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","great scenery, action and story",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Mind-blowing. If you don't see this film, you really are missing out. All the actors deserve a Oscar.",POSITIVE

"Mar 5, 2024",Loved the score and action sequences and the actors performances really hooked me in,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","The special effects are amazing and the acting continues to impress. Not having read the books, I wasn't sure I could follow the story, but I managed to do that. It was an entertaining almost three hours.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",epic! cannot wait for part 3.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Fans of the books will have a lot to appreciate here. General audiences may be left confused. If this film is building, as is rumored, towards a big screen adaptation of Dune Messiah, then the groundwork is laid. Stunning visuals and audio design.

I miss the Lynchian ""thoughts"" in this series. Instead we are told a great great deal.

They ""straight-washed"" the Baron, but we knew that was coming...",NEUTRAL
"Mar 5, 2024",Hands down the best movie of 2024 and the best Sci-Fi ever made right up there with Alien and Aliens. The inner Godzilla and Star wars fan inside me hurts at this statement but unfortunaly is the truth.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Loved it. Watch it in the D box. Fantastic,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Stunning visuals, incredible sounds, superb acting - definitely a must see.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",One of the greatest movies made in the last ten years. The creative adaption of the original novel adds flavor in areas like the sandworm riding sequence. The music and the sound are the heartbeat of the film. Watching this in IMAX was truly an experience of the year.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","It was good, but we didn't know there would be a part 3 later. Very disappointing.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 5, 2024","I really liked the last Dune film. Even more so on my second viewing. Dune: Part Two is bigger, more engaging, and even more impressive. While no film is perfect, this is one of the best I've seen in years. Bring on Dune: Part Three.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Great Movies. I just wish we didn't have to wait so long for part 3,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",A remarkable IMAX experience. Denis Villenuve is goated ,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Literally one of, if not the greatest sci fi movies in my 25 years of life. Gonna need a good sound system for this.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Dune part 2 for me atleast was a whole lot better than part 1,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","A perfect science fantasy epic! Perfect pace, perfect cast, perfect direction…this film has it ALL! A true masterpiece the kind of movie Hollywood needs right now! So mind blowing…see it on the BIGGEST screen possible! So epic! Bring on Dune Messiah!",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","A good balance of storytelling and visual spectacle.  Well acted, nicely paced (long movie that I didn't think about how long it was while watching).",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",The best sci-fi movie of all time.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","A surprise to almost no one, Dune Part Two is good. What comes as a much bigger surprise is that it isn't just good, it's incredible. A landmark cinematic achievement that is able to improve upon every strength and weakness of Part One while still adding even more fantastic material, it excels in every aspect. Dune Part Two is easily the most visually stunning, well written, and compelling blockbuster since The Lord of the Rings. In the face of modern Hollywood mediocrity, Dune Part Two puts to shame anything put to screen in recent memory. It deserves nothing less than to be enthusiastically praised as a true masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Best on many levels. Action. Thriller, Mystic, Romance.  Well Done",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Absolute epic tale. Rebecca Ferguson gives an amazing performance. Set designs the best I've since Endgame. The story and plot are a bit choppy in the beginning but the movie goes along at a good pace and battles last enough to one wanting more. Can't wait for Part Three!,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Some parts were just long! Still a great movie, it felt like stretching to get to 3 hours.",POSITIVE

Everything was nearly perfect, the acting, the visuals, the score. I'll be back to watch this at least a couple more times in the theater.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","For decades now, the public has been told ""Dune cannot be adapted"". Villeneuve has now seemingly done the impossible.
Dune Part 2 is a monumental achievement whose flaws pale in comparison to its brilliance. Running at 2.5 hours, Dune 2 almost feels too short and I'm already clamoring for extended cuts and a third film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","This film was a beautifully tragic sci-fi epic the likes of which we have never seen before. Timothee Chalement (sorry if I spelled this wrong) was INCREDIBLE and definitely better in Part Two than what he was in Part One. Austin Butler was UNHINGED and absolutely TERRIFYING as Feyd-Rautha. The rest of the cast is amazing as well. The scale of this film is enormous. I have never seen a film as large in scale since maybe Lord of the Rings. The world building is once again great. The religious themes were interesting and unique. The action intense and, well, EPIC. That is the only word I can use to describe this film: EPIC. Dune: Part Two is truly a work of art.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","AMAZING, Epic.  Does not disappoint.  Stayed pretty close to the book, the parts they left out didn't hurt the movie at all.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Overall the movie was spectacular to see but a lack of understanding about the effects of the water of life and a failure to see how Paul can predict the future will have a negative impact on the next movie. An easy example would be why did Paul need to ask his mother if Leto had known she was Harkonen. Paul can speak directly with his father. He knows what he knows. Unless the goal of the trilogy is to paint a stark difference between religious and non-religious peoples, Paul will need to be accepted as ""supernatural"" as Chani did in the books.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",A masterpiece ! Best sci fi movie since interstellar in my opinion.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",So incredibly intense. A must see in large format. An improvement on the first one for sure.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Lifetime fan of the novel and could only wish for a proper visual adaptation.  Villeneuve does not disappoint with either of the parts.  So well done, both visually, thematically and emotionally.  Now just have my fingers crossed that he'll make the adaptation of Dune: Messiah.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","A sci-fi large in its scope masterpiece. Action, cinematography, sound effects & performances are elevated. Timothée, Zendaya, Austin, Javier, Rébecca, Josh & Florence 🔥 Way better than the first one. Amazing score. Dennis Villeneuve did that. 5/5",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Even better than part 1.  Exceeded expectations and the soundtrack outdoes part 1 as well (and that says a lot).,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",I loved the visuals and the heart throbbing sound. Timothee Chalamet was amazing. It's unbelievable that the same actor performed the role Wonka as well as the swashbuckling Prince in Dune. People who have not seen Part 1 should watch it before seeing Part 2.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Incredible movie all around. I think it is superior to the first in terms of sheer action, higher stakes, and character development. Timothy is a boss in this movie and does an incredible job. Action sequences are top notch, as is the cinematography and score. Only one moment in the film felt a bit rushed, but in terms of running time it might have been necessary, also an almost unreal/quick leap in personality change felt a bit jarring/unwarranted for the quickness of it. But I highly recommend, and most definitely recommend seeing it on the big screen! Can't wait for the next one, hope it happens!",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Top 3 Alltime.
1. One upon a time in america
2. Dune 2
3. Top Gun: Maverick",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Sensational! Chills every act. Go see it in the cinema because I got a 4D experience basically - the speakers reverberation made my chair rumble with the earth worm and war  cries . SO COOL. (Also if all the girls didn't already have a crush on Timotheé Chalamet -thy do now),POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Cinematic masterpiece. Wonderful blend of adventure, action, mystery, thrill, and romance elements. As this IP comes from before popularized sci-fi franchises like Star Wars, it can be seen how attempts have been made to spin-off certain aspects from Dune, but not nearly as well as this original story.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",I loved everything about it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","It's an outstanding movie, I loved it. Waiting for part 3",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","STUNNING! CAPTIVATING! So much about this movie was amazing. The fight choreography was beautifully crafted, the strength that they gave Chani, how in depth they began to reveal characters and bringing the film closer to the books was all outstanding.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","A gorgeous followup trip to the 101st Century!  I love the way the story has been expanded to fill what will presumably be a 8+ hour trilogy.  I loved every second of this film.  Although I will see Part 2 many times, the long suffering wait for Part 3 begins ;-).",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Has LOTR Return of the King vibes. A Masterpiece!,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Absolutely fantastic. As someone who's read the original book three times, and seen all the previous iterations of the novel, this is without a doubt the best by a long shot. There were some alterations made to work within the film format, but frankly I thought it all worked well and added a bit of mystery for me as a viewer that I enjoyed. Really awesome work Denis! Here's to hoping for a 3rd and a 4th...",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",A visual and acoustic masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","The best movie I've ever seen, and the only movie review I've ever written.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","The movie was choppy. Editing was horrible, there were inconsistencies with how the actors looked between scenes. Sometimes they had blue eyes, sometimes they didn't. The scenes didn't match or flow. I kept asking, ""where did that come from?"" Regarding the worms: do the worms stop to get passengers on board?",NEGATIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Incredible movie, spectacular soundtrack, one of the best in science fiction.  It made me want to go back to the movies because I was sick of bad movies like Marvel or the latest Star Wars.  I'm going to read the books just for the movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","I want to love this movie. Despite being in a confused state throughout the film, I enjoyed what I was seeing visually. The lack of dialogue didn't work for me, although it's an aspect that would lessen the more I learned about the characters and world. I just don't get much of a chance at that within the movie. Despite my uninvolvement of the Dune world and its characters, I still have to be honest with the faults of the script and editing.

Other than the overarching plot, scenes happen rather than you being lead into scenes via an emotional journey. The first hour is a back and forth of random tests and does she like him or not. Many characters simply appear in the movie, some deep into the runtime, including a main villain who has no discernible traits other than evil for the sake of it. Some characters appear very briefly and don't do much at all. The motivation of everyone was stripped out of the script. We see an abundant amount of screen time on someone riding a worm, but large battles will abrubtly end after very little setup. Did we need a large segment of screen time involving the nukes, when we could've just been told that there's nukes? The nuke scene feels as a standout filler sequence perhaps to be overshadow a few dozen moments of filler that could've been replaced with plot.

I would challenge the praisers of this film to explain why everything was perfect. Austin Butler's character was great! Why? Because he was so one dimensional? The battles are the best! You mean snippets of battles that we got and one where it was hard to tell who was who. The score was amazing! Oh, the unbelievably overused bong noise that will randomly appear in the most tepid of scenes? Even the ""twist"" ending was foreshadowed in the first few minutes. This film is all spectacle with no emotional payoff. The number one praise that people will use to describe greatness of Dune 2 is the cinematography. This should be a leg that a great movie stands on, not the foundation. Although the direction and technicality of the look of Dune 2 is epic, the writing and editing are faulty. Maybe upon rewatches I would like it more since I might understand more of the details (after getting those details from other sources), but it's still nowhere as good as it could be or as most everyone seems to think it is.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 5, 2024",Dune part two was fantastic I absolutely enjoyed it,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","It is indeed better than the part one in storytelling, the audio and cinematography was amazing, I really enjoyed it in the cinema. However, the love story between Paul and Chani wasn't convincing to me, felt kinda awkward... Zendaya's performance in the later was plane... I couldn't understand what she wants to express... hopefully in part three it would be much clear.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 5, 2024","I liked Dune. I LOVED Dune 2!! Pitch perfect throughout. It isn't easy to make 3 hours fly by, but this most certainly did, and it even left me wanting more. Absolutely amazing! EPIC! Stupendous! etc., etc., etc.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Cinema Messiah

Just when you thought Oppenheimer was the top of adult spectacle, along comes Dune 2. As much as I enjoyed the first part, the second leaves it in the dust (literally and every other way).

The scale of the film, the effects, the worms, the witches, all take second place to the characters - TC's Paul, Austin Butler's amazing villain, RF as the witch mother, SS as Fatso - all great - but Javier Bardem steals this film as he did No Country and that sill James Bond movie. This film's star is desert fanaticism, and the emotional pull of the revolution, in which Bardem finds himself as the John the Baptist figure. This really is what Star Wars SHOULD have been all along but never was. Villeneuve is perfect as the director here - he captures the big in the small and the huge in the big. Zendaya is also central to the drama, but she is not so great, but maybe that's not all her fault.

It is long, slow and moody as hell, so unless you're prepared to be pulled along with the story, you might just fall asleep. Not me - it all worked for me. It is an absolute triumph of a sci-fi, one of the very best. Unlike the first film, it seems real and not pretend.

Pee first, then settle in and be prepared to be astonished.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Relentlessly stunning and haunting!,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Absolute must see! A Star Wars movie for a new generation.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",A cinematic feast alright but has deficiencies. Like some others thought part 1 was better and whisper it Zendaya has too much screen time. She's just not a confident enough presence for the role. Also thought it was just too clinical and clean. Too story boarded. However very much worth a night out in the cinema.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 5, 2024",Stayed basically true to the storyline.  Great effects and sound support.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",I also wanted to add that I viewed the movie in a new Screen-X theater (wrap-around screen) and the experience was amazing!!!,POSITIVE

"Mar 5, 2024",The movie followed the book closely with very little creative liberty keeping the integrity but adding some more realistic features. Timothee and Zendaya as well as all cast members gave brilliant performances. The music pulled you into the world of Dune making it hard to come back to the reality of the theater room. 10/10 movie.,POSITIVE

"Mar 5, 2024","At a level of artistry rarely seen on the big screen, Dune: Part Two illustrates what defines cinema: to transport the viewer to a different world. The passion behind this project seeps from the screen as one peers into this nigh mythological environment. With a piece of filmmaking this immersive, its story of visions, prophecies, and The Chosen One — a trope so exhaustively common in sci-fi and fantasy — becomes all the more sorrowful.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Its a Masterpiece. This film will be remembered as an all-time great. This is why I love movies!,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Dune part 2 was the best sci-fi I believe Ive ever seen.  The scenes were breathtaking and the actors were at the top of their game.,POSITIVE

Picture this: mind-blowing visuals, heart-pounding action, and characters so cool they practically ooze charisma. This sequel takes everything we loved about the first installment and cranks it up to eleven. As a cinema fanatic and a die-hard Dune fan, let me tell you, this movie is pure magic. From the breathtaking desert landscapes to the intricate political intrigue, every frame is a work of art. And don't even get me started on the performances - each actor brings their A-game, making you feel every moment right down to your core. So, if you're looking for a cinematic experience that's out of this world, Dune Part 2 is where it's at. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!""",POSITIVE

"Mar 5, 2024",Before Dune Parts 1 and 2 the most faithful book to sci-fi movie adaptation was Lord of the Rings. Not anymore. Wow. Part 2 channeled Frank Herbert. Visuals were stunning. Acting was brilliant. Producers of this saga didn't worry about pleasing this or that group. They just made a great movie faithfully using the source material.

As a bonus, it's a lot faster paced than the first part (as far as I remember)
Would absolutely recommend",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","The mystery is gone. Denis and team have opted to turn a great science fantasy story into a squabble between two teenagers, one of whom literally pouts like a spoiled daddy's girl in the final scenes. One scene follows another with little or no connection. How do they take a worm for a trip like it's a Greyhound bus? Where did these laser guns that the Fremen used come from and why does this make a few thousand of them superior to a far more numerous and advanced enemy like the Harkonnens? Lynch's Dune made the Fremen advantage clear. If Denis et al had taken more time to develop the essentials of this story than delving into a social experiment showing how the Fremen are ""aw, shucks…they're just like us"", there would have been more majesty than a glorified Friends episode. Paul Atredes was the ""messiah"" despite the weak comedy and open blasphemy. Herbert's sequel's title Dune Messiah kinda lets that one out of the bag. Good point: I liked the Harkonnens. Stellen Skarsgård was an excellent bad boy. The special effects and sound were fantastic and inspired awe despite the insipid Fremen business.

"Mar 5, 2024","This was an okay adaptation of the second half of the original Dune novel.  Be aware though that the ending in the movie is before the ending in the book, clearly set up as a cliffhanger so they can make a Dune 3, and 4, and 5, and so on, given that Herbert wrote 6 novels, and his son has written more, plenty is left to work with.  The cheap setup ending really ruined the movie for me.  David Lynch's ending was MUCH superior to this ending.  And, saying Lynch's awful movie did something better is sad, b/c the Lynch movie was horrendous.  The acting, special effects, and most of the story were okay, but the sell-out bid for another movie ending really torpedoed this for me.  Avoid the movie if you like closure.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 5, 2024","Dune: Part Two is a sci-fi sequel to the 2021 film adaptation of the book. The movie takes place right after the first film with Timothee Chalamet as Paul Atreides who teams up with Chani (Zendaya), and the Fremen to seek revenge against the people who destroyed his family. Now, I remember going to see the first movie and not knowing anything about the book or this movie, all I knew was that it was a new sci-fi film that people said was more mature than Star Wars and the amount of excitement I had when i walked out of that theatre was just the beginning because this movie exceeds just what the first part started. I feel like this movie does a lot better with setting up the story, explaining key factors and context, and also teasing what is to come in a possible sequel. The acting in this movie is so phenomenal, especially the chemistry between Chalamet and Zendaya. We were just beginning to see their relationship in the first part and this movie really fleshed out these characters and how this movie ended for the two was really fascinating to me and makes me wonder if we'll see these two again like we did. The two new additions to the cast were Florence Pugh and Austin Butler and I was really intrigued to see who they were and the roles they would play and they both were amazing as well. You could really feel the antagonizing threat that Butler's character was in this movie while also watching them set more up with Pugh's character and her destiny was interesting to me. The visuals in this movie were gorgeous, you can tell that the vfx team really worked hard on this movie, there were certain shots in this movie where they were just breathtaking and made me appreciate how beautiful cinema like this truly is. The action in this movie was both entertaining and thrilling and there were parts that really made me feel the threat that was at stake with the music cues and how effected I felt while watching the sequences play out. While watching this movie I was even debating whether Dune might be better than Star Wars just with how big the scale felt just in these two movies alone. I truly am enjoying this mature sci-fi tone that I feel is lacking with Star Wars. I also feel like this second part does better at establishing rules and explaining certain things better as the first movie felt subtle and like the writers were holding back and afraid of revealing too much too early. My one gripe or negative thought with this movie is there were many times where I felt like certain scenes weren't focused on enough and like the movie was skipping forward so much to pass time and I just feel like that messed with the flow and pacing a little bit but overall this movie does flow much better than the spice does in the first part. Overall, Dune: Part Two is not only an established adventure that ends with a more closing conclusion, but both enhances the first movie while also letting this part bask in all that it offers, action, visuals, tone, direction. production, performances, this movie truly might be top 5 movies of the year for me. Dune: Part Two gets an A+",POSITIVE

"Mar 5, 2024",Fantastic movie! It totally exceeded my expectations.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Visually very impressive great production design  grandiose self important...  but did I care?,NEUTRAL
"Mar 5, 2024",This has to be the absolute worst adaptation of Dune that has ever been made.  It didn't follow the book from the first 5 minutes in or onward. I wouldn't waste my time or money to go see it if you have ever read the book. If I was the director I would bury my whole body in the sand for a 1000 yrs. It sucks !!!!,NEGATIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Dune part two might have been one of the best movies I have ever graced my eyes and ears on wtf. From tiny details like the sand falling off churning machinery to the epic coloring and sound effects, the entire film was incredible. The acting felt realistic, not over done with crazy facial like a musical theater performance, which I feel from a lit of Sci-fi's. It did the books justice, and brought it all to screen perfectly. Overall I left the movie theater feeling like this was the climax of all media I have ever watched.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",By far the best movie of 2024 it will win every award as part one did! Dune: Messiah will be even better!,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Better than part one, starts off a bit slow but picks up A LOT as the movie goes on",POSITIVE

"Mar 5, 2024",Awesome Hollywood movie magic fun! This sets up a trilogy I think they are trying for a typical movie franchise !,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","An amazing adaptation of the book, genius screenwriting and epic action. Ending confused me a bit, I didn't think the book ended like that, will have to re-read. Everything else was focused, intense, and extremely well done. Rest of Hollywood, please take note.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","A bit dark, but super intense and entertaining",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","I loved this movie! Filmmakers crushed it, beautifully done. Go see this in the theaters if you can. The ambience is worth it!!!!! Overall a compelling storyline that fuels a strong third film while still coming off as a strong continuation from the first movie, which is hard to do with a sequel.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Cinema. You rarely see it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",A cinematic experience. Wonderful storytelling in a world filled with life and lore coupled with magnificent acting from a talented group complimented with astonishing visual effects.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Dud part two is more like it. Not enough action.  Boring.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Loved the movie - however the end was rushed. There was a big buildup of both Feyd R and the relationship btwn Paul and Chani and out of nowhere he proposes for the princess' hand. There was no development of that transition. It happened very quickly. The books pace is more balanced. The Feyd collosseum scene was unnecessary and very long... and Alia still not being born is frays far from the book,POSITIVE

"Mar 5, 2024",Dune 2 was as pretty good movie I liked how much action there was but there was a lot of great scene and the battles are impressive and I love the action that I think the movie was better than the original movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Visually - Giedi Prime was the most amazing thing I've ever seen. literally wow'd in the theaters - Truly a masterpiece,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Great, excellent, wonderfull ! Life is not in vain when watching this movie! Soundtrack a time of quiet between the storms gave me goosebumps, very majestic",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",A brilliant sequel. Denis Villeneuve and his fantastic cast deliver a true SF masterpiece once again. Can't wait for part 3 !,POSITIVE

"Mar 5, 2024","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. And I did so as soon as the trailer started. I dont want to give it away, but I found these to be the most creative trailers that Ive ever seen in support of an imminent movie! Ask for the film itself, absolutely spellbinding fast-paced provocative and very very cool!",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Visually exceptional, great acting and special effects,",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",This was a very good sequel to the first film. I really enjoyed it. I think it was better than the first one. lots of Action and good plot development and storyline. Awesome!!! 👍.,POSITIVE

"Mar 5, 2024","This movie is only another lame blockbuster. This movie did not give the importance to the details from the first movie such as the importance of the planet Dune. The movie was rushed only for the action because I guess that's what makes money. I'm sorely disappointed. The character development was lacking, many details were unnecessarily altered that were of importance. Hollywood is going down. I could only rely on A24 movies now. 😢",NEGATIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",It was not as good as episode 1. I did not feel they handled the beauty of the books. They didn't even touch on the Weirding Way.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 5, 2024","This was a breathtakingly beautiful film, with impressive soundtrack and phenomenal acting from the cast. Fans of the Dune book will definitely have some issues with the changes made in the second half of the film, but these things are unavoidable with adaptions. While there were some pacing issues in the middle, they were not significant. This is a truly enjoyable film that needs to be seen in theatres.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Dune 2 is simply one of the best theater experiences I've had in decades. The cinematography is exquisite, it holds close enough to the books to cause no major complaints, the casting was dead on, and the pacing, fx, etc. were on point.  
It was an ideal theater experience. The sound, images, story, direction, and acting all came together for a perfect theater experience. It held my attention, without fail, for the entire length of the film, and left me wanting more. It was immersive to a degree that I'm not sure I've experienced before, and set the standard for what a big screen movie should be in this era.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","I was pretty excited to see this movie. I felt the first one set the stage pretty well with a perfect reimagining of the awesome original. However after an about 1/4 of the way through the movie, it began to slip, then slide to and fro. I felt like the director tried to do too much, injecting a lot of details then racing to another subplot. The supporting characters were very artificial, some actors over acted, while others under acted. Climactic scenes were brushed over in a moment of gratuitous gestures. It was like Villenueve was directing with one arm tied behind his back and delivered a rough draft and they ran with it. Just didn't feel like it was in line with his resume to date.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 5, 2024",EPIC. amazing movie! 10/10,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Freaking epic ********. This is fantastic cinema mythology and a wonderful movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",best scifi film since empire strikes back and maybe the best ever,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Com muito mais ação do que o primeiro. Duna part 2 mantem a qualidade grafica e sonora do primeiro, so que com muito mais lutas e ação e deixar aberto para um terceiro filme. A parte negativa é que ele é lento e você sente o tempo do filme igual ao primeiro, mas vale ainda assim pela ação e pelas lutas",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Whilst visually very impressive I feel that the first instalment of the saga was better. I feel the movie shied away from establishing shots which made the scope of the film feel quite closed off. The second antagonist to the film, the emperor, I feel was miscast given all the mystique built up in the first entry. The sardaukar army also had a fantastic set up only for them to feel very underwhelming.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 5, 2024","It was an incredible film. First time I’ve left the theater impressed in a long time. The acting was incredible. The cinematography was fantastic. Definitely a must watch, and will be the best movie of the year.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Great plot and action. Some time skips but still good enough detail,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Honestly, I found it slightly better than part one, since this contains more action sequences. Can’t wait for part three!",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","It has stunning visuals, fantastic acting, and a powerful story. The pace is a little slower than I expected. It is a demonstration of what comprises good cinema.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","I am an Italian user, I watched the film a few days ago apart from the excellent special effects, even the action scenes, I found the film quite boring, I found the cuts made in some points which sometimes made it unclear and almost hasty some passages, a film well done on a visual level, but I didn't feel the same emotions as the first film, perhaps too high expectations reading the reviews that defined it as a true masterpiece, which in my opinion it wasn't. Everyone with their own opinions obviously.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Superb follow up to part one. Its intense, exciting, well acted and brilliantly filmed. One of the best science fiction films in many years. See it on the largest screen you can find!",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Lot of action, wont bother the length of the movie. Must see!",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",This is the best Sci-Fi sequel since Alien 2 or The Empire Strikes Back. The Cinematography and art direction are flawless.  The actors give excellent renditions and Villanueva becomes a new Spielberg and beyond in this beloved series.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","The second Dune was true to the book- although some
details were omitted- but overall well told. The characters were rich and well acted- cinematic quality was great- of course worm travel was excellent and the Freman walk will likely be a dance move- if it isnt already!",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Absolutely brilliant.  Music, cinematography, performances and wardrobe all the highest possible quality!",POSITIVE

"Mar 5, 2024","Absolutamente sensacional,  fazia tempo que um filme de ficção não tinha uma história boa com uma apresentação melhor ainda.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","I will say, it is an improvement from the first movie from the visuals, the action, the drama and even the performance.
I will admit that a couple of parts I kinda wanted more but those are my kind of nitpicks and I won't say too much as to avoid sharing spoilers to everyone.
Even from someone who still hasn't read the books, I will say this is one of the most phenomenal movies out there in cinema history for the 2020's.
It's worth a watch and I will say, this is worth being a nominee for Movie of 2024 along with a couple of other categories.
9/10.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Seeing it in IMAX was astonishing, that sound staging with action was just unrelenting, the story was great, the difference from the 80s version is similar if you see the original deleted scenes, but DV understands and wants to explain how and why the manipulation of people was done. It has legs for a 3rd and 4th movie, and I will be seeing it again in IMAX, I just can't get over how well it all gelled together. Best sci-fi I have seen in yrs.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","One of the best movies I've ever seen! Peak performances by Zendaya, Butler and Chalament, visually unbeliveably stunning and a soundtrack that shows us the genius of Hans Zimmer once more.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","Dune was good and so was Dune 2. They both should have been spectacularly mind-bending. An audience tells the tell following a movie. If the crowd stays over to talk and decompress from what they just witnessed or let out any emotional response, you have something special. The writers and director missed the golden opportunity to deliver. The casting was fine. The story behind Dune is epic. I'm left with a feeling you get on a blind date when you meet the wrong person.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 4, 2024","In general, I like Denis Villeneuve's films, but not this time...

It's not easy for me to say, but I have to conclude that this is the first film that so masterfully uses ""emptiness"" or ""nothingness"", this film is like an empty vessel, like a lifeless desert, it is beautiful in its own way, but it contains nothing but sand. The world of the ""master"" turned out to be sand-empty, the characters seem completely lifeless to me, the dialogues are emotionless, deliberately pretentious, I don't see much sense in them, they are absolutely not interesting to listen to, and they only confirm the shortcomings of the work. I would characterize the painting as minimalism in the void - a reflection of the inner world.

Fiction is one of the most difficult and expensive genres, and Frank Herbert's novel is a real masterpiece that requires special attention.

And I am well aware that to bring such a work to the screen is a huge work and beyond everyone's power, and the setting and ENT itself are tricky to perform and contain many ""pitfalls""

Villeneuve's vision and style, in my opinion, somewhat damaged the original source. The book text has been shortened and changed, which in turn affects the meaning of the story, conversations between the characters (oriental-style gibberish) seem like childish ""gibberish"", which makes them ridiculous and annoying without any benefit. It seems to me that the picture is not fully completed, the events are too compressed and leave many unanswered questions. The role of Christopher Walken in the film turned out to be quite poor and insignificant, he simply had nothing to play, and the antiheroes remained underdeveloped, unsaid, and even the most important ""villain"" faded from the narrative, Villeneuve could not come up with any intelligible arch for him, this once again shows the shortcomings of the creator, it is difficult for him to give personalities, but it is easy - images. The visual part of the work overshadowed the drama, leaving a feeling of fading and emptiness. To fully understand and analyze this picture, I will have to revise it, although I absolutely do not want to do this, because the visual style of the director in this picture turned out to be a common method that offers nothing but minimalism, contains neither meaning nor emotions, but only small images on a large empty canvas.

I will conclude my lengthy discussion with the words of Leonardo da Vinci: ""Where the spirit does not lead the artist's hand, there is no art...""",NEUTRAL
"Mar 4, 2024","As a long-time Herbert fan, I have a mixed opinion on this remake. My method of rating was determined by how well the movie conformed to the original Herbert characters depicted in his writings. Plot devices for cinematographic flow and entertainment are completely different. For example, in Lynch's 1984 version of Dune, the director made creative choices to advance the movie and entertain the audience (hero, Paul Atreides, overcomes enemies and sets everything to right with a distinct movie conclusion). Lynch stayed true to Herbert's characters, even if embellished, throughout. Villeneuve has strayed from my one key principle of novel-to-movie story-telling: he changed the motivations of certain key characters. This is particularly true of Chani. Perhaps I'm most sensitive to this as Chani has been one of my favorite characters for many decades. Herbert's Chani was central to Paul in attaining his maximum potential. Chani exemplified the power of women in a man's world. She supported Paul, compensated for his character weaknesses, and anchored him to his humanity. Herbert relied on subtle and not in-your-face feminine power, which by the way, successful women have accomplished for centuries. Villeneuve created a belligerent, brooding, and vindictive character in his version of Chani to assimilate with modern audiences. Perhaps men believe that women need to reiterate these traits to make them formidable: ridiculous. To me, this is complete sacrilege against Herbert's character. Further, the chemistry between Chalamet and Zendaya is forensic at best, totally decimating Herbert's love story, probably as a direct result of the atrocious character rewrite. This begs the question: Villeneuve, what makes you think you know better of how to portray Chani than Herbert himself? When it comes to the Fremen, the movie does provide a documentary-like and true-to-life aesthetic and rendition of Herbert's vision.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",This movie exceeded my expectations in every way. Very faithful to the books. When I left the theater I immediately wanted to go back in and watch it again. LOVE this movie. I hope Dune Messiah is in the works. If not it should be!,POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024",wow just wow....awesome and I'm not even a sci fi fan.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","If you are a fan of the book series, this strays from the book so much, the plot is almost unrecognizable. While it's visually appealing and the special effects and costumes are better than the David Lynch version, this is so disappointing from a story perspective.  I really tried to give this one an open mind but it was just annoying. I found the acting just okay for the most part, I did feel that Zendaya was ridiculous but perhaps that's exactly how her script was written. I think I'm done giving Denis Villeneuve a chance as a director, this is now the 3rd stinker of his I've struggled through.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Great second part to the story. Very entertaining. Interesting new characters. Excited for Messiah.,POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","Good action, but the monotonous desert is broken only by a monochrome scene, and the plot was trying.  Made-up emotional issues not really present in the book makes up most of the film as well as some important character changes that are cringe (characters forced to take actions they did willingly in the book).",NEUTRAL

"Mar 4, 2024","Dennis Villeneuve and his team have without a doubt set the bar for what  every sci-fi sequel should aspire to achieve. He created the most masterful balance of storytelling, pacing, action, romance, suspense that I have seen on screen in a long time. The acting is another level as well. Timothee Chalamet, Austin Butler and cast (too many too mention but all noteworthy) have also performed at an inspiring level. This movie will make your jaw drop, and is absolutely worth the price of a ticket, and that ticket should be to an IMAX theatre.",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","LISAN AL GAIB

The movie was much more fast paced than Part 1 and it definitely felt like after they held back on part 1 they were blasting through part 2. 

The movie explored complex topics such as Religion, Colonialism, etc. in a very intellectual way.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Beautiful, grand, huge, but also intimate. In many ways I preferred the first one, I guess because of the awe I felt seeing and hearing these alien yet fascinating visuals and sounds for the first time.
However, this film has several moments which surpass the first one. The lore deepens and I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes. 
I do think the director should remain the same throughout, but we'll see.
My favourite character was the mom; she looks so interesting.

However, if you haven't read the book -how would you follow the story? no mention of the space guild, the mentats, the weirding way, the blue eyes, the power of Maud dib is just not there. very disjointed. the director is giving Chani and oversized role vs the books and Alia is hardly mentioned. Glad I went, but--again--if i wasn't a die hard fan --would be totally lost. suggestion--watch the 1984 movie before you watch this--or--read the book-even better! thank you",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I'll add myself to the minority of reviewers who didn't care for the movie.  Most of the audience sat there at the end a lot bewildered. Yes, it was epic in terms of effects but the artistic license changes and omissions were annoying. No Guild, the Alia change, the Jihad coming too soon. The biggest WTF was probably the timeframe. No way he did all of this in six to eight months to be believable. Also there were a lot of characters who were miscast. As a Dune fanatic... Meh.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","I was excited to see the sequel, but when it finally came I was disappointed. So much of the movie was played in slow motion with melodic music playing in the background in an attempt to build tension or drama, but in my opinion there was far too much of that.

"Mar 4, 2024",Dune 2 embodies perfection.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Any work of visual art -- which is always very non-linear -- is somewhat lessened by trying to describe it in very linear written language...but, my best take:  This was a masterpiece in every regard, and certainly including the state-of-the-art CGI in the battle scenes, except one:  for lack of a better word...""tone.""  To me, the tone of the movie was a bit off as compared to ""Dune"" (Part 1).  It just wasn't as high-impact-stunning as the first, which had to be exceptionally good or a follow-on movie (this one) was never going to be made.  If there were one thing (and there wasn't) that I'd point my finger at in this regard, it would be the overall feel of the relationship between Fremen warrioress Chani and Paul Atreides.  And as for that, in a word:  ""forced""...not authentic.  This may be because of both the natural lack of chemistry between the two leads, and the ""overtime"" of attention on them in this Dune series version. 
 Best I can do for putting a finger on the issue of tone.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Visual spectacle with lack of substance. Its a steep departure from the book and characters motivations dont seem well flushed out. Chani lack purpose and serves only to be a rebellious teen. Visually its amazing though.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","loved it, made some changes according to the book, however they were necessary changes in my opinion. should see it in IMAX!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",This was one of the most impressive movies in terms of world building to have come out in a long time. The hyper realistic VFXs paired with the sheer scale of all the different places that are shown is jaw dropping!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Just saw it in Imax. Great experience. Loved the story and the battles within it. I highly recommend it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","A true cinematic experience! The positives speak for themselves and the only drawbacks I can see right now are changes from the book. I understand the changes but I wouldn't blame book fans for taking issue with these things. I wish there was the time-jump and that there were more surreal and trippy elements but that might add to the runtime so I get it. I'd be remiss if I didn't say that Greig Fraser and Denis Villeneuve are this decade's cinema dream team. THANK YOU studio overlords for green lighting this project. Hopefully, this will signal to the industry that moviegoers hunger for something grounded and substantial over forgettable CGI-fests.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",It's a masterpiece. I can't wait to add it to my library.,POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","Very Duney indeed. I likey Daddy, I likey.",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","If you haven't seen Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Avatar, The Matrix or Gladiator, then you'll enjoy the Dune films.
Still can't get my head around why they're stepping off intergalactic spaceships to fight with blades.
At least George Lucas had the good sense to put laser swords in his space opera. And make the protagonist somewhat likeable.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","THE ONLY TIME I LOOKED AT MY PHONE WAS TO CHECK HOW MUCH TIME THERE WAS LEFT, BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END!!!

I never review movies, and in fact I hardly go to the cinema; but after watching the trailer and the reviews for this one I felt like I had to and, oh boy, it sure did meet my expectations! What a great movie. If you liked the first part (I remember watching it and being a bit like meh), you'll love this one. 

As other people have pointed out, even if you are not that familiar with the Dune world (like me), the plot is very easy to follow, yet almost every minute in the movie there is something happening that is interesting and relevant to the story. 
In fact, apart from a very, very few cheesy scenes (you know, like the typical hero doing some acrobatics and killing a bunch of people, or the love scene that leads to a kiss), I must say there aren't many moments where you could even get bored.

After drinking my whole soda and holding myself for what it felt like forever, I finally decided to sneak out and go to the bathroom when one of the couple of these love scenes started and I had to literally run back to my seat because I was too afraid I was going to miss something important. Indeed when I arrived back after a minute, the scene had already changed and something important was going on.

Totally recommend it. I cannot wait for part 3!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Absolute must see, even if you aren’t a sci fi fan. Dune is the greatest sci-fi film of its generation. True masterpiece. If there is one film to not be missed in the theater. It’s this one.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Lives up to the hype. This is epic cinema done in a way we rarely see anymore. I haven't stopped thinking about it since I saw it. The story is multi-layered and deals with some of the darkest aspects of humanity … including the wielding of superstition and religion to manipulate the masses. The production is absolutely top-notch and sets a new bar in sci-fi filmmaking. I feel giddy that a movie like this was actually made and people are excited about seeing it! It gives me hope for the future of cinema. 

There are some valid criticisms of this movie, as there are some unexplained plot holes, and some of the events feel a little rushed … but these are minor complaints when taken in context.

To those claiming it's all CGI / AI, google the pics of the actual sets they built for this movie, including the massive emperor's throne room. And DV didn't take a whole team to the Arabian peninsula so he could create yet another green-screen marvel movie. 

This movie is the real deal. Go see it and support great sci-fi filmmaking!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Not since the Lord of the Rings has a book been so well adapted to film.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",The epic scale of vision and artistry expands ones mind beyond imagination. To all the individuals who made this movie possible I say BRAVO! Absolutely a Masterpiece for the ages. I cannot wait to see the next installment.,POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","Dune Part 2 is just the most thoughtful, mature, and well-crafted Sci-fi movie with the ending we needed after the ambiguous ending of Part 1. Just the very best Sci-fi movie of the last decade.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","For a fan of the book, too much has been changed or is missing. Chani is not betrayed and does not take off in a rage: a terible way to end the movie. The only purpose I can think of for this flagrant deviation is to force the studio to make part 3 by not giving the audience closure.  Also, what happened to is Paul's son? Where is Thufir Hawat? Paul's sister should have been born and freaked everyone out. No money ws spent on showing the grandeur of the imperial court; why be emperor if you can only afford dingy and bare rooms? Often visually stunning and mostly good but, in the end, an unfaithful interpretation.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 4, 2024","It was ok. Not as good as the first part. Visually stunning of course, and great special effects. Doesn't follow the book like part one did. No chemistry between the leads though.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 4, 2024","Visually stunning, emotionally gripping; the best film I have ever seen. I was immersed with the characters and story from beginning to end. I had to stop myself rising out my seat when Paul speaks at the council. This is a masterclass in sound design and exposition vs visual storytelling. Every scene with Feyd Rautha is somehow heavier than Daemon Targaryen's presence in House of the Dragon. I cannot wait to see it again.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Dune part 2 is a movie with a very endearing plot and characters that you can get close to, in this movie they develop concepts that they showed us in part 1. The only problem I see with the movie is that it can be complex to understand, and that it is a movie with a very extensive story, other than that the movie is perfect in everything.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",This is a masterpiece of cinema.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","We were immersed once more in the art and creativity of this wonderful story. I anticipate Dunes to be a world hit and to become immortalized forever. TC was amazing!!! I see an Oscar... and Zendy, gorgeous and bold.... we missed Duncan ... I wish he could've made it...

"Mar 4, 2024",Great action. Great character development. Perfect casting. Must be seen in IMAX.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","No words can start to grasp how you feel while watch this masterpiece. I can only assume this is what people felt watching The Empire Strikes Back when it first came out. This was art.

"Mar 4, 2024",This is by far the greatest movie I have seen In a long long time. I can't tell you how refreshing it is to go the movies and see an extremely well made movie.

Acting is perfect soundtracks are amazing cinematography is what we are used to it from greig fraser you can see how much everyone cared for this movie and it pays off one of the best experience I've had in cinema,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I saw Dune Part two on IMAX and it was stunning. Epic cinematography, Amazing sound. A longtime fan of the book series, I can't get enough, quickly enough to satisfy my appetite for this adaptation. I'm not even upset that some of the original story has been tweaked a bit.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","The film ignores the novel. Paul and Chani's relationship is portrayed completely wrong, doing Zendaya no favors. 
By the end, we are hoping the next sandworm eats her.
They ignore one of the most critical scenes and perhaps the best line from the novel, at Jamis's funeral rites. (With a key moment taken from Paul and given to Jessica.)

The entire point of the novel--Paul essentially transcending humanity--is played as a side note. Which they had to do for their completely misguided take on Chani to work.
Gurney is a weak shadow of his musical self in the book.
The birth of Alia and her role at the end?   Erased.

The mumbling--and most deadly--Count Fenring?  Gone.

Mentats as essential advisers? Gone.

Ferguson and Bardem are great, though they end up making Stilgar a figure of ridicule.

The more I think about it,  the worse it gets. Dropping it from three stars to 2.5. 

Make that 2.0.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Nowhere near as good as the original one.Guess will satisfy the younger generations,quiet messy and so boring though.Acting is also mediocre from the younger ones,Zendaya is just awful - ruined the character….I feel the higher rating are biased.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",An outstanding cinematic experience. It must be watch on IMAX.,POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","This movie is the definition of Epic! An absolute masterpiece that I cannot wait to watch again.

"Mar 4, 2024","I actually made a Rotten Tomatoes account simply to relay what a triumphant achievement this movie is. It is a surreal, and immersive journey, displaying an unmatched level of visual beauty. The movie does stray from the book in some ways, but it does so intelligently and with narrative purpose. The costumes, writing, cinematography, and acting are all top notch, and the musical score is absolutely perfect. This film is a career moment for everyone involved. Simply stated- It is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","The two part telling of the story of Dune (book 1) was amazing. The intensity and atmosphere of the Dune books was captured flawlessly by these 2 movies. The characters came alive, and most importantly, the character of Paul developed through Duke's son, fugitive, Freeman fighter, to messianic leader. Whether you loved the Dune books or just want to watch an awesome Sci Fiction adventure into a unique world, watch these movies. Can't wait till they adapt Dune Messiah and Children of Dune.",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","-Dune messiah is an epic story about the desperate play for power and survival of Paul Atreides against the wills and plans of several powerful factions in an intergalactic future.  A dependency on a crucial resource only found on one planet gives Paul reason and motive to manipulate the native people to become their messiah.  Paul's rapid rise to power leads to an abrupt ending with a souring betrayal and sufficiently used populous.  Regardless, the cinematic experience was immersive and I can still feel the blade Paul grasped that slipped through his hands. ",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","In a word...EPIC.  If you're looking at the run time and feeling anxious...don't.  It holds your attention.

I know Dune is based on a book series and had a movie way back, but for me it was better to have no knowledge of the source material.  Going in without expectations made this a great movie.  

Watched Dune Part One at home on HBO MAX and it was great to be able to see Part Two in an IMAX theater as the visuals/sound were incredible.

And for anyone making Star Wars comparisons, remember that Dune predates the original SW and was influential to George Lucas as he was developing his story.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Darn near the perfect movie.  Hollywood take note, this is what you get when you assemble real talent and they work together to produce a true masterpiece.  Ironically, I doubt this will qualify for best picture because it does not hit the DEI quota. Tragic.",POSITIVE

(It’s only hinted at) The other changes all make sense and you really can see how he was able to take control with his presence. The changes to Chani are also pretty good.  People say that there wasn’t enough chemistry but to me it looked pretty good.  You can see her conflict really well.  Excellent movie would recommend to anyone who was a fan of the first one, or likes epic fight scenes.",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","For a film that's almost 3 hours long it sure didn't feel that way. What can I say? Both the film and experience (in IMAX) was astonishing. The visuals, sound, story, acting was all top notch. Austin Butler killed it as Feyd-Rautha. If you enjoyed the first Dune you'll no doubt enjoy this entry as well. I highly recommend this film for anyone who loves action/sci-fi/fantasy stories OR if you want to escape reality for 3 hours. Either way...I loved DUNE Part 2.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I felt the movie was well written, very good CI, with much more action than part one. I took away a half star because the movie concluded on a cliff-hanger but I have read that a part three is in the works and will conclude the trilogy. If you saw the 1984 movie, don't expect to see the same thing after Paul ingests the Water of Life. I never read the book but what I have been told, this movie follows the book much more closely than the 1984 movie, so I'm lokking forward to the final film, which will probably be released in 2028.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 4, 2024","While Dune Part 2 is visually stunning, as a fan of the book, I was disappointed by the changes made for the film adaptation. The director seemed afraid to confuse audiences with the ""time jump"" that occurs in the book series, resulting in the loss of much of the complexity of the Fremen culture. Far too much effort was put into setting up for the next book in the series, leaving me with the feeling that this film was merely a dream sequence of one of the possible futures that Paul sees. The biggest disappointment by far was the changes made to each character's story and motivations, especially Chani.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 4, 2024",So amazing. Such a visual spectacle,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","In short, Dune Part 2 is a film worth seeing and appreciating, all its visuals are beautiful and delightful to see, the acting work of the entire cast is more than competent, it is brilliant, it feels like piece by piece this universe is settling its bases correctly and concisely; However, despite all this, I do also believe that the opinion of it is a little exaggerated, being the same compared to films like the Lord of the Rings, I truly respect that a new science fiction saga arrives and that it impacts the way it is doing it, but I do believe that the saga is still far from being considered a classic. Maybe it's just a matter of time before my perspective on the film changes. But by now Dune Part 2 is a good film with its respective defects that I hope will last and be an example to follow in other production companies.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 4, 2024","*SPOILER FREE* 
The Dune franchise  (part 1 and 2) is not perfectly executed, there are some minor pacing issues, but it is genuinely one of the most immersive worlds ever put to screen and as good as anyone can possibly hope for. It feels real. The world is real. 

When I think of the word immersive, I am implying that the world feels lived in. The world isn't begging for you to understand it with contrived exposition. But it does instill a sense of curiosity. Dune makes you want to understand it. Exposition is done with subtly, characters don't always show their hand, and the world feels like a place you need to learn. 

And for a huge sci-fi epic, I love that about this franchise. I believe it. 

Backed by an incredible score, unreal sound design, and mesmerizing visuals that looks like you are actually looking at reality, importance is placed on its fully realized characters. You completely understand everyone's motivations and nothing feels contrived to move the plot forward. You believe the relationships are real, and the characters convince you its lore and world are as real as our own. 

That is what blows me away, it feels grounded and huge at the same time. 

One issue, is pacing in its final act, but when you watch it you understand why. Also I consider part 1 & 2 the fully fleshed out story. Watching one without the other makes the story feel incomplete. So I can't say it's perfect. 

But what dune offers is unprecedented in scale and believability. Go to the theaters and genuinely enter this world. 

There is so much more to talk about, but the long and short of it is don't miss this. We have to support movies like this to convince Hollywood that we want quality at even the biggest scale.",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","The beauty of that film is out of my comprehension. Cool thematics were explored in a very fluid way. The narrative has no break, every scene leads to something important.

Paul's character development from the first to the second along with his relationship with channi, the tension between him and his mother, the funny but serious moments of stilgars glazing and just the overall tone and pacing of this movie are done PHENOMONALLY. i hardly ever review movies but i felt like i had to write just how amazing this movie is. i saw it with my girlfriend who didn't like the first movie but she thouroughly loved the second one. im going to watch the first and second one again with my friends this week and i plan on watch this movie for a 3rd time in theatres again because of how much i loved it. After wonka i thought Timothee was a goofy guy but after seeing this movie, you understand just how amazing timothee chalamet is and how this movie is THE sci fi movie of our generation. WATCH DUNE 2",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",The sound was at times overpowering. but the acting was superb and the sets and clothing was absolutely spot on. the movie run time was great.  and I would highly recommend it to others.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Timothy Chalamet does an excellent job evolving into the role of a slightly deranged leader.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Blown away by the closest adaptation to the book so far!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Dune pt. 2 is a cinematic masterpiece that must be seen in the theater...
Every element of this film is of the highest quality and completely enjoyable.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Epic!!! What the StarWars sequel trilogy should have been in tone and scope. Cannot wait for part 3!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Excellent movie. Continues the saga of the Dune legacy.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Do yourself a favor and familiarize yourself with the back stories of this universe but then go see this!  was great!!!! might go see a second theater showing!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Too long and disjointed.  I doubt people that hadn't read the books could follow the story. Part 1 was much better, although not as good as the original movie.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 4, 2024","I was actually surprised when it had ended, because it was so good, I never lost interest.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Great movie - locked in from start to finish. Cant wait for Dune 3,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","been a long time since I was fully engaged by a cinema release. The sound, music and visuals 100% gripped me. Yeah, there are some plot holes, but forgivable.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","A treat for the senses, Dune Part 2 wraps up the story with an epic and powerful spectacle.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","What the cinema was made for, unbelievable film",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Great visual effects but weak story line, confusing and too long.  Would have been just as good shaving of an hour.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Loved Timothee Chalamet,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Does Denis never go wrong?
Well in this movie he keeps me on the end of my seat. There are parts here and there where I think I have to watch again to give the last part of the star. In all it's a beautiful movie, it follows the story well and underlines the struggle of growing up and making sometimes impossible decisions. The epic music and incredibly beautiful filmmaking make this a must-see movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Good, not great.  The first movie was better, and this one relied exclusively on the character development from the first to prop up the plot.  I would say this movie's success is more a reflection of the lack of good options at the theaters over the last two years.  I would watch again, but should've done so originally on my couch.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Even I, a northern non-fundamentalist for the original film, can't deny any aspect of this absolutely encapsulating and brilliant film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",The worms and the battles are amazing!!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I really respect the fact that this thing is almost relentless in its bad vibes. No cheering, you are only be overwhelmed.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Incredible movie.

I liked dune 1 because Denis really slowed down the pace for world building.

Dune 2 absolutely benefits from this decision. Incredible movie, unbelievable pictures and the score from Hans Zimmer is just goosebumps.

The movie has everything: slow quiet scenes and on the other hand the action/ fighting scenes. Out of nowhere I felt goosebumps on my skin more than 5/6 times.

Go and watch Dune 2 in cinema!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Dune: Part Two is great. It has incredible action, captivating drama, and a stellar cast. The only main issue I have is the ending. After waiting 3 years to see the conclusion of the first Dune, we got another cliffhanger. I would have preferred something that wrapped up the story in a somewhat satisfying way, but what we got was just something that sets up another sequel.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",It was okay. Nothing to write home about. I could have waited for this to be on HBO. LOL Two movies that built up to a third movie is really dragging it out. We spent half of the movie with him in training. I almost fell asleep twice!,NEUTRAL
"Mar 4, 2024","Absolutely a film to watch, but given the premises, the budget and the heights to which the film aims i felt like it really felt short in some aspects. The special effects, most of the acting and the fight scenes are stunning, among the best i've ever seen, however the story lacks a lot. The first hour keeps the world building we saw in the first film, almost arriving to the point at whpich boredom starts to become overwhelming. Then the action scenes start, with the freman starting to fight the invaders. For me the problem from now on is that you never see a struggle. The good guys just completely waste the arkonnans without any type of organized resistance or attempt to repress them (they just continue sending small groups to them to be massacred in the desert) until when the main bad guy appears, magically (plot hole in my opinion) discovers the hideout of the good guys and massacres everyone, again in a one sided battle not shown on screen in which nobody even tries to resist (until that point the fremen where easily massacring the other guys, but suddenly as the plot requires it, the bad guys are better then them?). Then the good guys organzie themselves and again you have a  one sided battle in which the bad guys just get massacred. It makes you ask yourself why they didn t do it before if it was so easy, the film doeesn t really transmit the feeling of a struggle. It seems like if both sides receive power ups, to then become static again, waiting for the power up and response of the other side as if in a tennis match. Furthermore also most of the side plots are confusing and badly explained. I arrived at the end of it really confused to then discover that there wasn t really an end, the film just gets interrupted in the middle of yet another fight. In overall is a film to watch and then forget. Good cinema experience but that s all.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 4, 2024","Boring and weird, lacklustre fight scenes. Directionless. Did I mention weird?",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Loved this movie. 

No further comments necessary.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","This movie is why we still need to go to a theater to experience movies! I was completely taken into the story and transported to the dune universe. I had a smile on my face from the beginning and marveled at all the amazing things we were treated to on the big screen. Nit pickers will pull apart the small flaws in this film. But what is a perfect film? that is subjective. This accomplishes what the best films do, they give us a break from our small worlds, allow us to take a break from our problems and enjoy some needed fresh air and enjoy a needed mental vacation only a short distance from our homes. If you love good sci-fi and need an escape definately go see DUNE part 2! I reccomend seeing part one for the first time or again to prep your brain for the setting, but definately go see it in the theater in all its Big Screen glory!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Not a boring moment, not once!  If you enjoy movies about prophecies.. then go see this one.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Although it can be slow at times, the action, characters and thrilling visual more than make up for it. Timothee Chalemet and Austin Butler are huge stand outs and make for a great dynamic. Hans Zimmer's score is thrilling and boosts the already amazing visual aesthetics.  I am very excited to see where this story goes in future instalments.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","This film was more than a movie it was an immersive experience. Dune: Part Two is so effective and grand that it catapults you into another world, the world of Frank Herbert's Dune. One of the most beautifully crafted and captivating films I've ever seen, Dune: Part Two has entered the realm of my top 5 favorite movies for sure. A masterpiece of sci-fi that I will be sure to enjoy many times over. May thy knife chip and shatter if you happen to miss out on this amazing adventure! Enjoy!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",It was different than last movie all over the place but I was able to keep up. I like the new twist and the more in-depth to the whole story along with the changes,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","This outdoes the original in every way. Everyone turns in incredible performances. I would have picked someone else to be the Emperor because his presence distracting, but his role is rather minimal. If you are a Sci-Fi fan, you MUST see this movie in the theater.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Music way tooo loud and disrupted conversation on screen
Anti climactic ending
Maybe leaving it open for Dune 3?",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Stunning visuals. I have never read the books, so came in with little expectations or knowledge of the series. First Dune was great and Part Two was unbelievable.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I believe that Dune: Part Two was better than the first one, but it still just has a lot of slow parts. These movies are mostly for diehard fans because sometimes the storyline is hard to follow. Overall, though the cinematography is truly amazing and something that needs to be seen.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 4, 2024",Absolute Cinema! Watch in biggest screen possibile! Sci-fi is back!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","So i was debating if i should watch this move in a theater or just wait till it comes out digital and OMG thank good i watched it in the theater, the movie had me hooked from the beginning till the end, everything in this movie is amazing from the actors to the amazing camera shots and the best music ever, the fight scenes were amazing and the CGI looked like it was real life, all and all i give this movie a 10/10 and i kinda want to go to the theater to watch it again, Wold 100% recommend this Masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",What more to say then WOW,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Duna Parte 2 é um espetáculo cinematográficode narrativa, fotografia e sonoplastia. Bebendo abudantemente da fonte criada por Frank Herbert, Denis Villeneuve deu seu toque pessoal desenvolvendo um ambiente crescente, desbravado por meio de um enredo instigante e que mitiga questão que surgem na construção da trama. Duna (2021) e Duna 2 (2024) se tornam um clássico cinematográfico instantâneo. É inegável a potência construída por Villeneuve que mais uma vez se destaca na criação visual de universos.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","This has been the best movie I have ever seen so far this year! The cinematography, acting, settings, and I don't want to forget about the fights!!!!! I can't wait for future parts to come!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",The Holy War begins. -Jessica,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Did not equal the first.
Too much fighting, no plot. Diverged from the book.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Couldn't have been done better! If you're a fan of the Dune series- don't miss it!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Dune: Part Two is the epitome of where art and science fiction converge. Magnificent, grandiose, and sensitive, it stands as a masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","More of a Spiritual Experience than a Film. It is Dream States, Drug Scapes, Enlightenment, a tale of Fate, a Hans Zimmer Music Video, and a Madman’s Rise from Humble; to Messiah. If the first movie gave you chills in your neck and into your shoulders and up into the bottom and middle of your skull, this one will give you more. ",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Loved it. The acting, cinematography, story, everything.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Awesome movie although it did change things from the books a bit.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",One of the best movies I have ever seen! ,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Best movie I've ever seen. Everyone brought their A game and delivered tremendous work in every facet of this masterpiece. Run to the theater and see it on the biggest screen you can find!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Great special effects.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","That was so amazing. The take on first book (s) was spot on, the beautiful cinematography, the acting/story and special effects - would not have been the same on any size TV!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Unbelievable!! Going to see it again,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",I fell asleep during the movie. Would not watch it again.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","It did Dune justice, worth watching!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",The definition of being lost in a movie. Completely forgot I was watching a movie for 3 hours. Even during the slower parts of the movie. 10/10 best theatre experience I've possibly ever had,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","a great adaptation, i was ok with all the changes they made from the books (Leto 2nd, Alia, Lady Fenring, etc.) but I wished we had the mentions of the Golden Path and The Spice Must Flow.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Great sound track .follows the books as close as they could,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Breathtaking. Truly captured the passion and intrigue of the book.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",A great movie after so much time,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",One of the best movies I've ever seen. And the best cinematic experience I've had in IMAX.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Well told and had amazing visuals. It was well-acted. A bit too loud but that could be the theater's fault. Well done,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Truly epic, great character and story work, with one of the best scores of the last couple of decades.  Very subversive movie that is not shy about it. Thoroughly absorbs Herbert's themes about the dangers of hero worship.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","O ritmo está bem melhor do que o primeiro, a ação e o CGI também estão ótimos!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Best movie I have watched in a long time, possibly of all time. The 3 hour run time does not feel like enough as you will be sucked in from the beginning and won't want to look away. Dune: Part Two is a true masterpiece, and is much more than your average dystopian sci-fi film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Did a good job on the backstory of the main characters!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","The filme is perfect, there are some things that are different in the first book, but regardless... it is a master piece, the songs, the environment and the adaptation are breath taking. And I don't even want to get in the character development (Paul, Feyd, Chani and some other characters).",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Dune 1 & 2 were both movies that did the book credit!  And that's pretty rare.  Awesome Job, Loved them!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",A must watch!!! No words needed for this movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Best movie I have seen in a long time, planning to rewatch again! We made the mistake of not seeing it in IMAX. Great visuals, soundtrack and storyline. This sequel was definitely better than the first movie! I wish it were longer, the time flew by.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","If you enjoyed the story and/or the visuals of the first installment then this becomes a MUST-SEE! Watched it yesterday and was impressed to say the least, brought so many different elements to bear all within the first hour and the story came to a very tense and resonating culmination towards that last half hour! Very well paced and edited to match the screen time and did not feel too long or drawn out to me. My GF was compelled and she usually isn't one to be immersed much into a storyline. I would say, highly impressed with the adaptation, pacing and editing for sure! Kept the viewer not just entertained but invested in the characters and the storyline. Although, not a stand alone piece, this second part I would surmise be the better of the three parts in as far as the story development and action are concerned. Highly enjoyable in the right format, I would say definitely watch this in IMAX if at all possible...Worth every penny!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Visually brilliant, the music intense and well suited to the dramatic story line. Skipped parts of the book that weren't necessary but kept the best parts. 10/10 for me.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Absolutely breathtaking. One in a decade. For sure will gonna watch it in IMAX again.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",This movie is a masterpiece. Very impressive and immersive.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","First review I'm writing on rotten tomatoes, simply because I can't believe some of these „expert opinions"" - seriously, you're giving it a 3/5? WHAT THE FUCK is wrong with you? 

I watched it in Dolby Atmos (of course) and what can I say - honestly the best cinema experience I've ever had - maybe even the best movie I've ever seen. The cinematography is amazing, the sounds / music is amazing, and I simply love the story. It's something new, it's exciting, and it's not as generic as most other movies. Even though it's 3h, it never got boring. I was even leaning forward in my seat at times, really scared/excited for what's going to happen - I usually never have this. 

Sure, opinions are subjective. But if one rates this masterpiece as a 3/5, one is crazy.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","A masterpiece. See it in the biggest, loudest place you can find.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","A Gritty, chilling, dramatic, stylistic epic that perfectly adats it source material into an incredibly visual universe. The next star wars indeed.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Despite trying not to laugh initially at Austin Butler sounding like a bald, space Elvis, this film is everything that cinema was made for. Whether you are a seasoned veteran of the Dune books and stories or you love Sci-Fi and Fantasy, there isn't a trilogy of films that I have been so excited and enthralled with since Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. Villeneuve has created something that will stand the test of time in cinema, and Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is stunningly beautiful. There is no part of this film that bores you, even the parts that are perceived to be 'slower' are still so engaging and the ability to build character arcs for those characters that are only in one film is excellent. 
Dune: Part 2 in short, is a cinematic masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I found this the best piece of cinema i have ever seen, its amazing. so well done and best characters ever.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I can only imagine that the way I felt after watching this movie is how people in 1977 felt after watching Star Wars for the first time. Denis Villeneuve's vision for this story, accompanied by Greg Fraser's cinematography and Hanz Zimmer's score, is a visual and emotional masterpiece. The characters are SO compelling, the story makes you feel every emotion, and the action is thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is a masterful Sci-Fi adventure. It's Star Wars for adults.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","For the most part I liked the movie enough to watch it. I absolutely loved Part 1 and watched it several times. I have read the book, and I expected some changes to the story because the book is massive with content and I can accept that. Part 1 did that well. Part 2 however, deviates from the story especially with  the character Chani to the point it damages the story. I think the director honestly thought he could do better than a great source material.  The absence of  young Alia from movie was also disappointing and unnecessary. At this point I’m pretty worried that Dune Messiah will be a giant waste of time.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 4, 2024","This movie is without a shadow of a doubt the greatest movie of the 21st century and possibly of all time. It definitely deserves a spot up there with the greats like Empire Strikes Back and The Two Towers as this movie is the definition of perfect. 

Dune 2 delivered in every way meeting and even exceeding all expectations. I am truly lucky to be alive to witness this movie as I did in IMAX.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Filmão do krl this switch descrever 500 oscars, habe the best fight and War scenes EVER. Fuck star wars (I love star wars thought)",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",This movie was absolutely fantastic. This will for sure be an Oscar contender for the 2025 awards. The cinematography is phenomenal and the action is superb.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","A fantastic adaptation of the book continued, Villeneuve got the scale bang on once again, paticularly the battle scenes. Visually even better than Part One, his rendition of Guedi Prime was superb. And of course all tied together with another brilliant score from Hans Zimmer. I'm sure it's going to be just as good on a rewatch!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Visually spectacular! So good to have a near perfect film experience after the general dross that have been served up over the last year/s…,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Thoroughly enjoyed this.  Did not disappoint,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Wow- great film that was worth the wait (not having it last Fall was discouraging).  Loved every bit of it- found myself very moved by it!  3 hours is long to sit- but the movie held you in your seat!!  A++++,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","This gave me everything I wanted from the Dune universe and more. An amazing adaptation. Pacing was right, acting brilliant, visuals were phenomenal and the slight departure from the book worked in my opinion.",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","The best IMAX movie experience ever, legendary story, stunning photography, master's soundtrack, a near-perfect movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Even if you're not a fan of the Dune Series (books, games, movies, short series, etc) or an avid follower of the MuaD'Dib, this movie is by far the best one so far. The fact that the writers did their absolute best to show only the most important moments is astonishing. The cinematography is on point, the sound is awesome (definitely recommend watching the movie in cinema or with good sound system / headphones), the plot was clear but well presented, the whole package was complete.
After the 3 hours have gone I did not feel like I've spent 3 hours strapped to a chair. It was a pleasure watching this. Go watch it !",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","An excellent film with stunning sets, landscapes, and an outstanding cast.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","As a reader who is addicted to anything dune, I can confirm dune part 2 is very cool :D",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I loved it. The world building, the music score (best of all time?) the brutalism, the acting, the epic scale, the action and above everything else, the athmosphere! This is how it's done, this is science fiction for adults! I got severe goosebumps from watching the rise of the Kwisatz Haderach! An absolute masterpiece. Dune 2 delivers on the promises of the first film and opens up for a third installment.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Think everyone was disappointed in how it ended. Too many subtitles & weird names of the tribes, etc. Just a movie you don't walk away from with a good feeling. You just say to yourself why did I waste 3 hours of my time. Wouldn't see it again if you paid me.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I really liked the Dune saga, and part 2 was not a disappointment!",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","Absolutely stunning effects! Will there be a part 3??  It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so impactful, I literally felt like I was in the actual movie! My heart stopped multiple times! This is on the same level as the greats such as  Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. I plan on seeing it a second time.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","There’s too much to compliment and praise about a nearly perfect film,, so I will focus on my nitpicks. 1. Walken did a good job, but he pulls me out of it. 2. Florence Pugh’s Princess Irulan needed just the slightest bit more development,  3. Gurney & Rabban’s fight should have been a bit longer and more intense for a better payoff. 4. The final battle between the Harkonnen’s/Emperor and the Fremen was a little too easy for them to win, although the battle was incredible. 9.7/10!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",It's impossible for me to give anything less than 5 stars. This film is what the cinema was made for. Denis Villeneuve is a visionary genius. Can't wait to see it again.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Excellent film. Best I’ve seen in a long time.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Beautiful sets and landscapes. Excellent cast. One of Hans Zimmers best score with the vocals of Lisa Gerrard that bring awe to yet another level. Best version of Dune so far but ending is not satisfactory: now we expected Dune 3,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Great movie. But it fails to really tell the accurate story with its changes to Chani and a few others. when will Directors ever learn that we don't want their own version, we want the authors.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The first movie was solid. This second movie was epic. I remember seeing Dune in the 80s and this reboot of the series puts it to shame. Bravo, Denis Villeneuve.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Symphonic epicness and world building of lord of the rings. AWESOME,POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","IMAX version is EPIC!
Great action, great audio, good acting,  expands on the OG Dune and part 1, can't wait to have this for the home theater! 
Storyline seemed to jump forward 2 or 3 times where it felt like they had to edit parts out due to time.
Maybe a director version someday? 
I would give it 5 stars then.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Excellent, as you might expect given Part-I previously.  Of course, leave's-open the ending for subsequent sequels from the Dune ""franchise"".  Not sure how long they can keep up this quality level though!",POSITIVE

Dune Part 2 is fraking great!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","This was an incredible movie. The acting, cinematography, soundtrack were all phenomenal. There were a few times were the dialogue was hard to hear. This is 100% a movie you should see in Dolby, IMAX or whatever giant screen you can find.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",I love it! Great production and powerful music!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Great cinematography and amazing musical score. One of the best franchises of the genre, and an extremely impressive follow up to what was already a fantastic start in Dune (2021).",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",It’s everything we hoped it would be,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Dune: Part Two was hands down one of the best cinematic experiences that I have witnessed in the last 30 years! This film is meant to be seen in the theater on the biggest screen possible. For those who thought Part One was more on the slow side with more character development, will be very pleased to hear that Part Two ups the ante with the action spectacle. There was so many iconic scenes and visuals that it's hard to say which one was my favorite. Our newcombers for Part Two with Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, and Christopher Walken are all awesome. Austin's character especially is very good and he transforms into the role. Some may not even realize that it's him in the role, as his features and voice are both unrecognizable here. I can't wait to watch the in depth behind the scenes to see how this movie was made. Music Composer Hans Zimmer does an absolute terrific job once again on the score as it is epic on so many levels. Part 2 does such a great job of story telling that even if someone missed Part One they would still understand what is transpiring. I'm already looking forward on what Part Three will have in store for us. Dune: Part Two gets the highest rating score possible with a perfect 5 stars out of 5. Go see it!",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","As epic in scale as it is complex in narrative, Dune: Part Two continues the Dune saga in an exceptional fashion.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","A little on the long side but definitely everything the first movie brought to the table and more. A lot more light hearted which helps with a near 3 hour film of literal doom and gloom. It’s hard to see next years Oscars not give this movie all the same accolades as part 1 but since it’s a sequel I’m sure the lazy voters will snub this greatly. All the characters get more depth which is a plus. The lure that the Dune IP has to offer is something that today’s audience can eat up like there’s no tomorrow. The story was easier for me to follow this time around, it’s just that some of the names escapes me at first and it didn’t help that everyone either spoke like Batman or whisper talked, and the sound was both loud and demanding on an enjoyable scale. I highly suggest seeing this in Imax. This movie is great and I look forward to future projects. If you don’t like the franchise or any of the cast members then this movie probably won’t tickle your fancy, but if you’re turned off by anything in the film… why are you watching? If you love cinema, this is a movie to be experienced, not simply seen. ",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","A complex, action-packed, beautifully imagined science fiction epic. There were no popcorn tub gimmicks or IMAX for me -- just a decent seat near the center of a small-town one-screen movie theater. It still knocked my socks off. Feels like a once-in-a-generation moviegoing experience on the order of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and the original Star Wars trilogy. I suspect this will start a lifelong love of Dune for many young viewers, and should delight most readers of the Frank Herbert books. Where the movie's story and characters deviate from the literature, it tends to elevate or streamline concepts in a surprising and satisfying way. I can see how this film may leave some viewers confused, or how it might disappoint those who want a more faithful telling based on the novel -- an impossible wish, but an understandable one -- but anyone with a pulse should find it well worth their time to at least watch Paul Atreides attempt to ride the sandworm.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Satisfying end to the movie and was pretty true to the book. Some fans will gripe about the dialogue or the changes to the Chani arc, but overall it felt good. Held to the pace and spirit of the books. Visually it was stunning. Visionary entertainment. I think Frank Herbert would have been pleased. Pretty well acted throughout. Stilgar was less a fanatic in the books but I was OK with that. Chani and Paul were well acted. Their love wasn't romantic but felt lived in. Like an older still loving couple who'd been around each other for along time. I personally wasn't a fan of the Walken casting for the emperor. He was OK. I would have preferred Sean Bean or someone of that type. Bean can bring a nobility and pride while being flawed. I'm thinking of his performance in LOTR which could have had some of that same feel. Anyway, still a marvel to look at and I'll probably see it again.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Best sci-fi movie ever.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Visual effects are insane. This movie did not disappoint. Left the theater feeling empty hearted because I still wanted more!! It has been a while since I’ve watched a quality film. Great job to the whole cast and crew. They all did an amazing job. I can’t wait to see the final chapter of the film.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","It's impossible to summarize Dune Part 2 because none of the typical analysis applies.  What it does better than any modern science fiction film is take you there. Dune Part One showed you another world, but Part Two throws you into that world and it does it forcefully. There will be many different view points on what people felt and saw on that journey, but what won't be in dispute is that they were on a journey. 

Thematically these movies share far more with the Godfather 1&2 than say Star Wars.  It is about weilding power, and the price you pay for doing so.  Those details are not always pleasant, the good guys do not alway win, and the ones that do often lose much of what they care about in the bargain.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Intense and incredible piece of film making. It feels slow but moves along steadily at the same time, which is quite a trick. The book is pretty ponderous at times. It works on more than one level as well. It's a story about fanaticism, the price of leadership and blind belief, and stays true to Herbert's vision while making some great tweaks -- The role of Chain is really powerful. Great acting and Austin Butler is terrifying.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Dune part II is a great sequel to the first. However, for anyone who has not yet seen part I, it may be confusing. The cinematography and storyline are arguably the most impressive features of Dune Part II. The acting, in certain moments is not the best, but that is made up by the stunning visual effects and cinematography.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Great action and effects. Very complicated story told in a complicated way. Some dialog was hard to understand even in imax.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Tactile and epic.  Every piece of machinery and grain of sand is felt through the screen.  The battle sequences in Dune: Part Two reach toward the level of quality in setup, scale, and character payoff seen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

The sound design is so detailed -- you can hear the hydraulic hiss of the thumpers reloading in closeup shots, but when a father angle is shown, you can only hear the bass of their rhythmic thud on the sand.  Hans Zimmer provides and even better soundtrack this time than in part one!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Visually spectacular! Dialog was fantastic! Stunningly Beautiful adaptation from book to screen. Proves once again Disney ruined StarWars. The only struggle in the movie, is Christopher Walkin as emperor. Great Job! I will see it in theater again.",POSITIVE

I loved the first film, I wasn't surprised realizing the second was going to surpass DUNE. 

Please see it in the theater.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",This movie has spoiled in watching future movies. It is the most visually and auditorily stunning movie I have ever seen. you must see this in a good theater to fully enjoy the work that the production crew has put together. Worth every penny.,POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024",Masterpiece! Seen 3 times now!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","First off, Dune Part Two does justice to Frank Herbert's visions when he authored the book. The complex thoughts and writing from the novel is carried out beautifully as the story switches out between separate planets and settings, and ultimately creating different cinematic experiences every half hour or so.

Focusing less on comparisons around the book, Dune Part Two feels unique to the first movie. Regarding their similarities of how Part Two upscales everything that Part One did right (and removed EVERY criticism I had with it), the pacing of Dune Part Two is crafted excellently.

Each arc in the story is written and filmed like a Greek Epic, with Timothée Chalamet being your Heracles. Simple dialogues will distract you with beautiful sunsets and brutal battles immerse you with the sense of victory or the pain of loss.

I especially was a fan of Austin Butler's performance as one of antagonists and his acting was downright horrific at times, when mere logic causes an advisor to have his throat slit due to Feyd's psychotic tendencies.

Chalamet stepping up as a leader in his Hero's Journey is a transcendent experience, as he quickly transforms from bland, intelligent, and strong rich kid to a planning politician with a guide to his goals within his mind. Overall, Paul Atreidus becomes an actually interesting character.

This movie had some unintentional comedic moments. The Fremen's reaction to anything that Paul did made my near-entire theater laugh three times.

Already, this review is getting very long, but props to Hans Zimmer for creating yet another majestic score for a movie.

That's not all I have to say, but you get the picture.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Epic. This is what action sci-fi movies should be. The entire movie was an experience I havnt felt in a theater for a very long time.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Great cinematography and acting.  The storyline was easy to follow .,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",This was definitely a blockbuster movie and a must see for all who were fans of the first movie!  Loved the acting and cinematography!  I didn't give it 4 stars due to a couple slow parts .,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",It was so awesome!! Highly recommend it,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","This movie captures all of the pages of the source material from the book, perfectly, step by step. I have never been so impressed with a movie series that has stayed true to the book and left out all of the Hollywood exaggeration and sway from the story. Magnificent.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","This movie was very well directed.I really thought that the visual effects,set design ,costumes,sound effects,music score by Hans Zimmer,story, casting were all out standing!Acting Timothee Chalamee , Zendaya and the other supporting cast were all be very convincing.At the least  Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya both deserve nominations for an Oscar.I can only hope that Academy of Motion Pictures will give this movie the recognition it deserves.Two thumbs up from me!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Wow!!! Exceeded expectations…!  Top 5 ever….,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","""Dune: Part Two"" is spellbinding science fiction with plenty of brains and spectacle. This movie continues where the previous film left off and is just full of visual flair and many jaw-dropping moments. I do feel I preferred this movie as it's more payoff, and less exposition-focused. I do feel I liked the film because there are multiple moments that are just spectacular on an IMAX screen and the way the story and characters come together, progressing the story, as well as setting up for more, is done really well. I think the performances of this movie are all good, but it is really the direction and visual style of director Denis Villeneuve that makes it stand out. He has solidified himself as one of the great modern directors and someone who just knows how to make good sci-fi. Overall, it is a great continuation of this universe that I enjoyed seeing in the theater and think gets better the more I think about it.

Update: Not even a week later I went to rewatch this thing in IMAX. This movie is outstanding and the story really clicked more for me upon the second viewing. I think this is one of the finest sci-fi movies of recent memory and Denis has really crafted something special here, and I can't wait to even watch it again in the near future.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Breathtaking!!!!!!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Ridiculous, confusing, long and pointless. It didn't end cleany and there is obviously a part 3 coming -but i won't be going. But nice costumes lol. The first Dune part 1 was a tad better but was also in need of some serious editing. Long does not equal good. Story matters and this just has a terrible story that I never cared for. I never cared for any of the characters. There were so many stabbings and shootings as to make one sick.  Have fun

These films will not stand the test of time.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Exceeded my expectations! I really enjoyed the movie. 9.9 out of 10.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Absolutely mesmerizing. Fantastic!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","In ideal sequel fashion, ""Dune: Part Two"" takes each element that made the first film so appealing and amps it up to nth degree. The action, the visuals, the performances, the stakes — everything's much more impactful and impressive this time around. Gotta say, though, if they somehow find a way to bottle whatever the first half of this movie was running on, Hollywood will have tapped into the kind of God mode none of us could've imagined possible. The color palette, the camaraderie, the character development, even the budding relationship between Paul and Chani (honestly something I never thought would end up being one of my favorite parts) was just so fulfilling to see. None of this is to say that the second half is lesser or bad. It's just different, bigger and rife with more implications for the future of this franchise. Something about seeing the humble beginnings of this journey on Arrakis that I really vibed with. Also, you gotta love the slow burn build-up around Austin Butler's ""Feyd Rautha."" Both the actor and character are just having such a blast and I'm here for every minute of it. Really, really enjoyed this. If the past decade of cinema has taught us anything, it's to throw as much money as possible at Denis Villeneuve. Moviegoers eyes and ears (I'm looking at you, Hans) will be better for it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Perfect ending for this part of the story. I only hope they continue telling more.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",best IMAX theatrical movie this year and last year hands down,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",I really enjoyed it. Ive been waiting a long time so expectations were high. It did not disappoint.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","So accurate to the books. The arena scene shot in infrared was stunning. Great acting, great production, overall, the best film I've seen in the last year.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Beautiful yet turgid. Dune: the movie planet where every inhabitant speaks in the same gloomy monotone as every other inhabitant. It's like a single bland personality inhabiting a hundred different  characters' bodies, all of them slogging through utterly pedestrian dialogue for 2.5 hours. It's relentlessly monotone and tedious, by hey, it looks good. No doubt. Director Denis Villeneuve has boasted in an interview that he ""really hates dialogue"" and jeezus is that ever obvious in this gloomy slog. Every character speaks every line as if it's an epic profundity from the lips of a Byzantine priest.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 4, 2024",The end was just phenomenal. I wasnt thrilled about the last 45 minutes until I was there and now I know why it was that long.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Simply amazing.  Loved it even more the 2nd time I saw it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Loved the visuals & soundtrack. A lot happens in the story. Action scenes are excellent .,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Fantastic! There were a couple liberties taken from the source (I think by necessity) but they pulled off the story beautifully. Not to mention the tone of both halves was perfect. (Chef’s kiss - muah!) I hope a way can be found to continue the story with the same love, dedication, and hard work that was put in to these 2 movies. Definite must see!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",It was amazing! Def gonna be a part 3!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Blew all my expectations away!   Bonus, is there going to be a third movie?!?!?   Please say yes.",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","The iMax soundtrack was set way way too LOUD, but the movie was a faithful adaptation.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I really enjoyed Dune part 2. Although, it was a very long movie, and I definitely felt it while watching the film, i understood that it had alot of story building to do. Im not mad at it. I would rather for book to movie adaptations to capture most things that has occurred. If you don't really care to capture the cinematic art piece in theaters, it's ok to enjoy at home on your couch, and take breaks in between if you cant sit through the whole movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Amazing. Visually stunning and amazingly written.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","it's a good movie. The, scale look and sound of the movie is epic. The story mostly follows the book. No major complaints cause if you've read the book you know the challenges. My biggest meh is for the limited amount of sophisticated dialogue. I think Denis felt he had to keep both movies simple for larger ticket $$. I've seen it twice and I'll see at least once more in IMAX.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Very short 2hr 46 min.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Absolutely brilliant portrayal of the book. Authentic acting--strong character development over time.  Desert scenes were amazing, e.g., desert views, worm-riding. Appreciated the realistic presence of People of Color in the desert regions. Sound-track music was hauntingly beautiful and fit the setting. Stunning military and fighter scenes.  Captured well the ""plans within plans"" for power-holding and manipulation to gain power. Javier Bardem was wonderful. I am waiting for DUNE Part 3.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",This was the first movie I've seen fill a theater at an early showing on a Sunday. For good reason this work lived up to the hype. A modern day Star Wars must see. Closest thing I will experience to what it must have been like back then.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Watch Dune part 1 then come see the masterpiece that is Dune part 2.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",It's the best movie of the actual cinema a true cult movie in the make.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","A true 5/5 movie, well worth watching, I think it's the best Sci-Fi franchise since the original Star Wars.

So great, watching in theaters is a must. Truly impressive!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","This movie is a gripping and well-acted film that skillfully builds suspense. It showcases the enduring influence of ""Dune"" on science fiction, particularly on works like ""Star Wars."" The film leaves me hopeful for a wider recognition of it's impact on the genre.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","This is a great example of CGI enhancing a story instead of carrying a story. I’ve never never read any of the new novels, but I’ve heard so many stories about it. I was also told that there was no way they could turn this into a motion picture. However, after watching both part one part two, this is probably the greatest cinematic experience since Lord of the rings.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",It's a shame Hollywood can't make more movies half as good as this one in today's day and age.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","lost storyline, things happen out of nowhere, extremely loud and predictable, they try to lift this kind of movie by adding all those obnoxious sound effects that end up making you stand up from your seat and leave the place altogether. I wish they would give money back for what we paid for such a boring movie.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",I thought it was an epic production and followed the book very closely which I really enjoyed.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Amazing cinematography, acting and story. I’d give it a 96%. ",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Visually stunning. The score is still great. It feels better than the first one, still has a weak plot for me.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I found nothing compelling about it, I kept checking my watch.  Part 1 was at least a 7.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Lots of action, amazing special effects. You could really feel the struggle to grab hold and and not fall the first time Paul rides the sand worm.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Epic Hard Science Fiction faithful to its source material.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Engaged throughout the whole movie, loved the whole show!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I've watched this 3 times now. This is a monumental piece of work, the kind that only seems to show up once every few decades. I never thought I'd see another cinematic miracle after Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings. Denis Villeneuve is one of the GoATs of cinema with his audacity in adapting Frank Herbert's dense sci-fi epic into this spectacular cinematic masterpiece. He has honoured Frank Herbert's work so well, transposing the spirit and key themes of the book to tell this compelling story. 

Dune: Part Two is made at the highest level of craft from cinematography, production design, visual effects, and sound. Everything feels so tactile and real.  Hans Zimmer's score is just sublime here, especially with the love theme.  The casting is just impeccable and I wish I could spend more hours with these characters. Watching this on IMAX is the only way to fully experience this epic. 

Now I need 'Dune: Messiah' to finish Paul's arc. I need it more for Chani and Princess Irulan. 

Final verdict: Great-Mother Sandworm out of 5 stars.",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","i went to see it tonight 3/3/2024... The special effects were great, but they changed the story waaaaay too much! It was somewhat unrecognizable!

"Mar 4, 2024","With exceptional showings from A-list actors like Timothee Chalamet, Austin Butler, and Rebecca Ferguson, and Hollywood heavyweights such as Villeneuve and Zimmer, ""Dune: Part 2"", is a movie set up for success. It manages to radiate an aura of mystique that seems to finally capture the evasive spirit of the original novel on the silver screen. Villeneuve's unmistakable craft has established himself as one of the premier auteurs of the sci-fi genre, setting a new standard for films of the future.  In spite of this however, despite the initially slow pacing, the movie still manages to create a romance that seems excessively bland and generic in nature.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",This is an epic masterpiece comparable to Lawrence of Arabia.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",There weren't any scenes that weren't perfect.  I assume there will be a Part Three and now I need to go back and watch Part One.  Somehow I missed that.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Great movie saw it twice!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Amazing. Epic. Beautiful.,POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024",Outstanding! Epic story and a stunning visual and audio experience! This is how you make a film saga.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Excellent movie and I can't wait for the next one!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Spot on, even if long, but then the story is long. Sooooooo well done in every way. Casting for 2 leads was perfect for both parts. SF reader here and never could stand Herbert's writing but the story make great movies.

Special xfx and sound should no MUST be experienced in a theater like IMAX or REGAL RPX ( better in RPX as it has seat thumpers that make you a part of all the actions).

Part 1 was 5 stars part 2is 4 1/2 as some of the visual and the story itself are not as dramatic.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Cinematography and sound were untouchable,POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024",Dune Part II triumph!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Dune: Part Two is absolutely brilliant, it's better than Part One in pretty much every way possible. Dune: Part One was just a setup, while Dune: Part Two truly is the real deal. Dune: Part Two is about Paul trying to gain the trust of the Fremen, at the beginning of the Movie there were many that believed Paul was the Messiah, but there were also many that didn't believe it. Anyway the final act of the Movie is by far the Best part, it includes a lot of action and breathtaking visuals. The acting was also incredible, the acting of the first Movie was already pretty great but the acting in this one is even better. I also loved Paul's character development in this one, seeing him go from being just the Duke's Son to becoming an all knowing hero who can see the future was incredible to watch. Overall Dune: Part Two truly is amazing, and it's definitely the Best Movie of 2024 so far!",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I didn't quite fully understand the meaning behind why everyone kept calling Dune Part Two (DPT) ""epic."" I understand now.

Having read all the books, thoroughly enjoyed Dune Part One (DPO), and then to watch a back-to-back early release double feature of DPO and DPT I can say I'm beyond impressed. Impressed truly doesnt even begin to embody and sense of the granduity of DPT.

DPT seamlessly picks up from where DPO left off, creating an even more immersive experience. Nonetheless, beyond my imaginable capabilities somehow DPT increases the meticulous level of attention and detail to the films mise en scene.

The costumes once again go above and beyond, I'm not sure how to even put it into words. They looked real. They fit the scenes. They looked like they belong.

The musical score, I didn't think it could get better than DPO - I stand a fool! The musical score for DPT leaves you with goosebumps for almost the entirety of the runtime. If it doesn't achieve an award I will truly battle the great houses myself!

The visual effects. Lost for words, truly dont could encompass how stunning they are here. You'll have to lead on faith for this one.

All the actors and actresses complete this film, not like it's their job, but something they truly want to work on and truly do beyond their capabilities for and this shows.

The hype is real. The spice must flow. The third Dune must come.

If you liked DPO you will lose it for DPT. Enough said.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Excellent! Cannot wait to see how they conclude it with “Dune: Messiah”,POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024",omgoodness! The twist that the movie took! And the fighting scenes did not disappoint. Im ready for Dune 3!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","After a second cinematic viewing, I gotta say: this movie absolutely swept me off my feet. Dune: Part Two embodies the very essence of cinema, gracefully navigating the spectrum from highs to lows, discreet and thunderous moments, and seamlessly weaving together a tapestry of buildup and action, story, and emotion.

Every accolade in the technical realm rightfully belongs to this cinematic gem. From the meticulous craftsmanship in costumes and makeup to the masterful cinematography, true to life visual effects, and intricate production design—each element contributes to this film's golden excellence. And let's not forget the breathtaking SCORE by Hans Zimmer, undoubtedly propelling him toward yet another well-deserved Oscar.

Denis Villeneuve, surpassing his own high standards, has skillfully brought together a remarkable ensemble, presenting a set of films that truly does justice to Frank Herbert's universe. Special commendation must be extended to Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, and Javier Bardem for their truly awe-inspiring performances on the screen. Powerful, vulnerable and lighthearted moments, brilliantly brought to life.

For anyone considering a cinematic experience, especially in the grandeur of IMAX, Dune: Part Two stands out as a must-see movie. It is a guarantee that you will not be disappointed!",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","As the first Dune part, the second was as amazing and breathtaking. Seen in IMAX.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","While I'm not as invested in this particular universe as I am in others and while it was slightly pretentious in tone, this movie grabbed my attention with its awesome action/fight sequences, its interesting twist, and the powerful way they ended it! Denis Villeneuve is a very skillful director with a detailed eye for filmmaking and I cannot help but like every movie of his that I see. The villains (especially the new younger one) were intimidating and the internal disagreements and conflict that the Freman had among themselves made the film less simplistic and more like it would likely be in real life among any group looking for/waiting for a prophet. Quality action, visuals, story, and characters/character development makes for a quality film!",NEUTRAL
"Mar 4, 2024",Great movie with suprior cinematography.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Great visuals, bounced around too much and was too long.",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","Dune for Dummies.  Visually excellent.  Solid cast.  Made no sense.  Dialog written for cretins.  ""Side chick angry"" ""pale Drax mad and frightened""   Fun and completely forgettable.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 4, 2024","Deviates a lot from the book in ways that work great for adaptation, but it also seems like fight scenes were also cut short to keep the story moving. The other main downside is the score isn't as front and center, probably to highlight the changes after the first film. From how long this took to come out I feel like a director's cut might be even better",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Definitely one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. The experience was fantastic, I spent more than 10 minutes with my mouth open trying to understand the film and its grandeur. Absolutely cinema.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Happy with the movie. It was really well made and had some exciting spots even though there were also some slow spots.,POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024",excellent rep mtl ma G Denniis,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",first 1/3 of the movie dragged on. overall movie was good but I wouldn't watch it again.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","The epic sci-fi film we were all craving. Denis Villenueve doubles down on everything that made the first film good, making this film incredible. The action sequences and visuals were astounding to experience on screen. Hans Zimmer’s score is its own character and really carries the emotion of the film. Zendaya, Butler, and Bardem brought their A-game and were great, but Chalamet REALLY stepped it up from the last film and brought this intensity to his character. This film was everything a sci-fi film should be: intense action sequences, an epic score, emotional, and characters we care about.  Dune Part 2 isn’t the best film ever made, but it is definitely a science fiction masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Kept the story close to the book. Epic cinematography that kept my interest through the slow parts. Wish it was shorter, but accuracy beats budget.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","This is the first film I've seen in cinemas, where I understood what it must have felt like to watch lord of the rings, star wars and other classic experiences while they were being released in theaters.",POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","It is hard to make a pile of sand, some awesome worms and a bunch of rag wrapped people be interesting for nearly three hours.  I like the story of Dune but the screen adaptation is no where near the Movie of the Century, perhaps not even the last ten years.  As usual, the critics are living on some movie planet far, far away.  Get real.  Worth the see, one time, kids will be bored to tears.  Save em, people in the movie need em.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 4, 2024",Phenomenal!! If you can see it in 4DX. The acting and cinematography and story line kept me totally engaged. Wow! ,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","I wish this would have been a miniseries. It felt like they packed a lot into a couple hours; but it was still good. More interesting than the first one. Visually impressive, intriguing storyline, great buildup for the next one. I will say, though, I don't really care for Timothy Chamotte. He's too boyish to buy as a leader and a soldier.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Special effects and story. Great acting. Desert girl who plays love interest is not good actress, they need to replace her.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",Very exciting and intense the whole way through. I hope part 3 comes sooner!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",I actively avoided all marketing for this film so i could watch and react honestly and open mindedly. No movie speech has given me more chills up my spine than that of Maud-dib Usul. Never read the books but MAN!!! I was blown away. Magnificent artistry throughout and I felt like i wasn't bored at any single point. I didn't know it was 3 hours but I swear it felt like 2. I need more!,POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","This movie was a great follow up to the first Dune. Absolutely incredible acting, cinematography, music. It was incredible. Definitely a longer than usual movie but worth every minute.

"Mar 4, 2024","Dune 2 One of those unnecessary, take-themselves-way-to-serious- religiously vicious movies And way to loud!!! Waste of 30 unless you absolutely love religious wars Come to think of it, are there any other kinds of wars besides religious wars Technically very well done, but, for me, just a big loud variation on the theme I feel bad for Frank!!",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",An absolute Masterpiece! Such a breath of fresh air!! Gave me faith in the Cinema again!,POSITIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","Great epic tale....great cinematography, sound, storyline, acting. Held well to book.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Don't be duped by this movie!
If, like me, you were led to believe that this is part 2 of a 2 part movie, then you've been duped. This is part 2 of a 3 part movie trilogy. This movie has so many cliffhangers at the end there is no way there isn't going to be a 3rd part.
I left the theater feeling betrayed. I am sick to death of Hollywood lying to me about stuff like this. 

Anyone reading this be warned that 1) you need to go into this movie with the first movie fresh in your mind AND 2) be warned that the movie does not ""resolve"" properly. You won't leave this movie feeling satisfied. 
This movie doesn't review the first movie, it just picks up after the first movie with no refresher course. The first movie was 2 and a half years ago. Are we really supposed to remember every little detail from a movie 2 1/2 years ago? No. This was probably part of the plan all along. Wait so darn long for the second movie you almost HAVE to watch the first one again. Oh and of course that means spending more money. It's hard to remember every little thing from the first movie, but you NEED to know every little thing from the first movie to understand the second movie. Otherwise the second movie is a mostly confusing bunch of gibberish for the most part.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",A bit of a meandering slow plot line like first.  At least there was a little action / resolution towards end - but all leading to another movie.... clearly.,NEUTRAL

"Mar 3, 2024","I rarely give a movie a perfect score. Dune part 2 wasn't totally perfect. However, the cinematography, scale, special effects, score, and choreography were all some of the best I've ever seen in any movie.

It's one of my top 5 movies ever.",POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024",Best sci-fi movie of the century.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Some gorgeous cinematography/digital landscape artistry, but the characters were sadly clich and were too lacking in dimension to be impactful. Cutting a full hour out of the film would have at least made it a tighter, rollicking piece.

"Mar 3, 2024","If you like the 1st Dune movie then you will enjoy this one . The cast, story and visuals are outstanding!! This is a must see on the biggest screen possible!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Dune 2 is an absolutely thrilling and biblical sci fi epic. Not only does it fulfil the promises made in Part 1 but gives us hope to see more with Dune Messiah. Timothee Charlamet, like Paul Atreides has grown into his role and gives one of his best performances yet. The whole cast are at the top of their game and Hanz Zimmers score rocks yet again. The film isnt perfect but how Denis Villaneuve has managed to adapt such dense source material is just masterful.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I had never read the story, I didn't know the background. It gave me a hard time on part 1, who, what, why, I had question marks all the time. But now, I enjoy part 2 much better, I know who Paul is, what the spice does, and why Paul wants revenge. The better I understand it, it means the more you need to watch part 1 before it. There's definitely a knowledge threshold. 

When I watched it, I could think but couldn't think deeply. I accept Paul as the saver, but I don't accept how he becomes the saver (If Stilgar believes in me, I could be their saver, too). I accept Freemen hates Sardaukar, but I don't accept it's because of spice (Freemen cares about the water much more than the spice, TBH). I accept Freemen fight Sardaukar, but I don't accept how the rudimentary side wins the war (Sand Worms vs Spaceship?)

Overall, it's a filmed poem, an opera, a sang. You can enjoy it on a gigantic screen, with Dolby Sound, but please don't read my review.

Emotional Personal Careless Score: 8/10",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Perfect. No notes. 

The adjustments to the narrative were not only necessarily for adapting it to screen but gave fresh fire to the story's central tensions and overall message.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Definitely must have bladder control as you won’t want to miss a single moment of this epic (running 2 hrs 45 min).   Details important to flesh out the stories are generally not left behind so even those who have never read the books (you really should though) will understand the complexities.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Dune Part Two. Review.

Luego de que Tom Cruise nos diera un Masterpiece en el 2022 con Top Gun Maverick, nos habiamos quedado con las ganas de un filme épico, desarrollo de personajes elite, un guión en la madre y la banda sonora mas bestial que e escuchado este año, asi fue como todo comenzó y finalizó al ver Dune 2.

Dune: Part Two amplía la cautivadora construcción de mundos y las impresionantes imágenes establecidas en la primera película sin dejar atras la banda sonora de mi querendon Hans Zimmer que le da ese toque épico al filme en cada momento. El director Denis Villeneuve crea magistralmente una experiencia visual inmersiva, dando vida al planeta desértico Arrakis y sus colosales gusanos de arena con un detalle impresionante me acordo mucho a filmes de Star Wars y The Lord of the Rings solo que en Dune 2 
La historia profundiza en las complejas maquinaciones políticas y las luchas de poder en juego, aumentando los riesgos para Paul Atreides y sus aliados Fremen.

 Si bien la película sobresale en sus aspectos técnicos y ofrece secuencias de acción emocionantes, algunos pueden encontrar el ritmo narrativo deliberado y la profundidad emocional reservada para ciertos personajes. Sin embargo, aquellos interesados ​​en la intrincada historia y los temas del universo de Frank Herbert encontrarán mucho que apreciar en esta ambiciosa y visualmente impresionante secuela, ta to asi que Zendaya, Josh Brolin, y hasta Austin Butler como Feyd Rautha un personaje sadistico, calculador y rudo, haciendo quedar mal hasta el mismo Batidta con el personaje Beast Rabban, caras nuevas como la princesa Irulan (Florence Pugh), el emperador  (Christopher Walken) y la James Bond girl Léa Seydoux como Lady Margot Fenring son de esos papeles que le dieron ese toque a la gama de personajes, sin dejar atras a la hermosa y talentosa Rebecca Ferguson y el tremendo Timothée Chalamet que se robaron el show.

En fin este filme lo tiene que ver todo el mundo eso si les advierto dura casi 3 horas que es larga, densa en historia, acción y escenas epicas. Altamente recomendada. La primera esta actualmente en MAX.

Clasificada: A
10/10 Masterpiece!",POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024","Great film.  The director did great with setting up tension and moving along without feeling the need to hold audience's hand.  As a result, there can be subtlety and mystery that warrants a second (or third) watch.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Very long.   Needs less preaching.   Needs more worms.   Needs more Dave Bautista. Christopher Walken terribly miscast.   Beautiful set design.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",Cinematic masterpiece .   Christopher Walken meh .       Not 100% accurate to book.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",The dune fighting and travelling scenes were breath-taking. The use of colours was magnificent and extraordinary. Viewing in an IMAX theatre was definitely an epical enjoyment. The pictures telling the sci-fi story were convincing enough to fuse viewer into its universe.,POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024","I have not seen an epic so well crafted, acted, and executed since The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The visuals, sounds, storytelling all take you into the world of Dune.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",A rhapsodic masterpiece and triumph of human creativity! The culmination of decades of technological and artistic evolution beginning with Frank Herbert's completion and publication of the novel in 1965 and brought to life in a grand crescendo in 2024 by the peerless Denis Villenuvue. This is a work infused with and possessed by such powerful spirit that watching it brings about a genuine spiritual experience. The story is treated like a Holy text and the cinema a Holy Temple. One of the great works produced by mankind.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",I likes the first one better- this didnt follow the story line - the rich subtlety of Dune got lost in this.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","While the movie itself, and the visuals make for a fantastic cinema experience, and tells a wonderful story, lovers of the book may find themselves leaving a bit deflated due to the treatment of some characters, and the complete omission of others who featured in the first instalment and seemingly vanished without trace.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Well crafted but anticlimactic. Big and loud but in no way exhilarating. Maybe next time.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","Excellent Part 2 of Dune! I really enjoyed this movie, possibly even more than part 2. I cannot wait for the next one. I haven't read the books,  so everything is unexpected for me. Timothee & Zendaya are fantastic. Well done!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Simply incredible. This has easily the potential to rightfully enter the history of great cinematic trilogies. Epic, dramatic, unpredictable, but always grounded in a well-built world. All the actors give great performances and all the characters are believable and interesting. An absolute must, which improves on the first and manages to tackle many themes effectively.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",This is why you go to the cinema! It's an amazing picture. Beautiful shots with an extraordinary score. It grips you and never let's go even after it ends you want more. Congratulations Denis and company on a beautiful and gripping picture. A must see!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Monumental and the best sci fi movie I've ever watched,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Dune Part 2 is different. From the romance to the action to the oddly satisfying deaths. It has what you need. I do recommend watching Part 1 so you can fully understand this master piece. 🏆10/10.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Wow. Just wow. Can a movie be any better? I don't think so. It's a must-see-experience (highly recommended in IMAX theatre).,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Really fun movie, and the pacing was great. I'm glad they extended the first book in two movies!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Visually lovely to look at.  A lot of characters and action!,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",Cinematically stunning!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Second time seeing this movie only reaffirms my impressions I got before. A masterpiece in sci-fi cinema. One for the ages. I hope we get a chance to see the director Denis Villenueve do Dune Messiah. What a picture man.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Excellent movie. Timothée Chalamet continues his dominance and his growing career. I was never much of a DUNE fan but after the first one a few years ago and now the second one, I definitely am a new fan.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",It captures the book beautifully.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","This film was great, can't wait for PT3",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",great and amazing movie highly recommend!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","phenomenal, the chemistry between Chani and Paul is great. just everything about this was great, can't wait to see what's in the works for Part 3",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",the cinematography was absolutely spectacular. the fighting was choreographed to perfection and the backgrounds were stunning overall a perfect movie. if it doesn't win an Oscar the Oscars are rigged,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Truly amazing cinematic achievement. Better than the already great Part 1 in all aspects. Great acting; breathtaking cinematography; excellent soundtrack. I actually ended up wanting at least 30 more minutes. This will surely go as one of the best sci-fi sequels ever. Really hoping Part 3 is greenlit soon.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Beautiful visually.  Great cinematagraphy on the desert scenes.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",Very good fast paced film. Great action but the characters need more depth.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",If Dune Part one was the fellowship of the ring of sci-fi then Dune part two absolutely is the two towers of Sci fi. It is the best movie I've seen in about 5 years. It deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Absolute epic on all grounds. Pays homage to the source material with a stacked cast and an amazing adventure. ,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",I think the movie was very entertaining with great visual effects.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Im a Dune fan so my opinion may be bias 
I love the characters, the story line, the action. All of the above! Thank you",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","A sci-fi sequel that builds on everything, even the heavy philosophical discussions that will evoke complicated feelings for some, Villeneuve's Dune adaptation continues to be visually epic, characteristically layered, and boldly unique.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Pacing was substantially slow in the first half, too fast in the second. Omissions of world building (like not describing the nuclear reaction of shields and lasguns, making blade fighting important; missing Sardaukar infiltrators; and certain missing characters like Count Fenring)  and canon changes were distracting. Does show the terrible, unstoppable momentum of the Fremen Jihad once it gets moving. Timothy Chalamet was a brilliant Paul in all respects,  and the Austin Butler Feyd Ruatha was genuinely intense without being over the top. Beautifully filmed.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Definitely awesome. The soundtrack is amazing. I wish a couple fight scenes would have lasted a little longer, but overall this was solid. Part II was worth the wait after seeing the first.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",One odd thing- I don't think that part 1 or 2 explained WHY spice was so important.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Great movie to follow up with the first. CGI was incredible
 Enjoyed the Character development. Just a bit lengthy. Highly recommend.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","3 hours of movie, and you still want MORE.  Congratulations tò Villeneuve and all the cast.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Fantastic sequel to an already fantastic first movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Very cinematic. Very beautifully shot. Story pacing turned me off.  Not made for a causal movie viewing,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","Like it all , no dislikes. Hurry and make number 3, its on mommas bucket list :)",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Sci-Fi masterpiece. Can't wait to see where the story goes from here.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",From start to finish  loved it.  Kept you on the edge of your seat.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Insanely fantastic film. The acting (Chamalet was astounding), the story, the visuals, the music. Spectacular",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Amazing. Long but worth it. Acting, cinematography, storyline, everything A+",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I am biased for knowing the novel, and elevated the movie by almost a half star because it was a pretty strong adaptation of the original work. More cinematic, more movie like, yet faithful to the original spirit. Other than that, no contest on the grand scenes, but pitiful character development or plot advancement, very weak shallow antagonists. It definitely will not stay at 9.0 IMDB ",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","Visually stunning, with an incredible score, and a handful of great performances. Denis Villeneuve continues to make a case for himself as one of the best directors in the business.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Pretty Damned Impressive, everything just seemed Soo Right. Writing, Directing, Cinematography, action sequences, casting, character development, script. All in all a visual and sensory crescendo to be sure. 5 stars easily earned. I can't wait for the last installment.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The Good: This visuals are awesome, the action is awesome, the acting is awesome. 
The Bad: It's an overused plot. Rich kid loses everything, moves in with the poor, falls in love with a poor girl, uses the poor people to rise up and take his rich life back. 
Yes, I recommend this film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","exceptional movie, I haven't felt such emotion for a long time",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Cinematography and choice of story lines were reinforcing, in exposition of the plot.
I prefer it to the Lynch version.
But everyone has their own opinion, and seeing all three is worthwhile.
I enjoyed it!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Great film! Haven't read the book. I feel somehow sorry for Chani. The ending for me was little bit disappointing, but probably it is similiar in Dune novel.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Dune is a masterclass in storytelling, worldbuilding, and cinematography. Most characters are fully realized with motivations that push the story forward in interesting ways. Unlike a lot of films, characters aren't used to service the demands of the script therefore, most people feel layered and three-dimensional. Unfortunately, I feel as though the antagonists could have been fleshed out more, but that doesn't take away from the powerful moments that involve them. If you're looking for a film with emotion, striking visuals, and large-scale warfare, then Dune is the film for you.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",At this moment (until part 3 arrive) its the best film in this decade.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Long live the blockbusters!! This movie is everything and more that I expected from Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Dune after the stellar part one! Epic visuals, character portrayals and sound. It was worth the over two year wait. It's a must see on the biggest screen!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",I didn’t want the movie to end! So good!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","What a great movie.   I would definitely give this a 9/10.  The action is top notch, the acting is on point and the parts they adapted from the book makes this version feel like you are a apart of the environment.  Over all, this movie hits the major points of the story and makes you feel as if you are there.  If they could have had a small bit of inner-monologue to tell you what was happening at the end, it would have made that part a little more impactful.   Over all, great movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",One of the greatest movies I’ve ever seen. Go out and watch it NOW,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Kept you in your seat!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",An absolute master piece! The movie got my full attention through out the entire 2hours 45min. The visual and audio enjoyment is on a total new level.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",my heart was just racing. Gotta be in my top list of all time so far! Hanz Zimmer score was freaking incredible!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","If you read the book, you're probably going to be disappointed in this movie.  Out of sequence events, different story lines, changes to characters and more.  All that aside, this movie seemed to meander around.  Not like the first movie at all.  It was pretty, but that was about it for me.  Hard to tell if there will be a Dune 3, or if they will add things from the 1st book to Children of Dune.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I was disappointed in the ending. Although it may have followed the book, I wasn't expecting such a cliff-hanger.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Banging. Close to perfect as it gets,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Visually and audibly spectacular. Performances, effects, story, all well above the usual blockbuster fare. Well worth the running time, which is paced brilliantly nonetheless.  This one is an achievement of the highest order.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Sequel well potrayed. Nothing but equisit.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Very slow, predictable, time lime was confusing, and the back and forth between dark and bright scenes made it hard to watch. Everyone around me was shifting in their seats due to being uncomfortable for that long and some were napping. Save your money and stream it from home (and I watched in a Dobly high end theater.. but it was a waste).",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",This is a work of art this film is as close to perfect as you can get from emotion to amazing action and great character. Timotee does a amazing job! (Don't know how to spell it) amazing ending to set up dune part 3,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Amazing movie , very entertaining",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Liked it. It was on the long side but great.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Fantastic! A few deviations from source material I didn't like but overall and epic experience,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Dune 2 was incredible. It's early to say movie of the year… but movie of the last 5-10 years from a sci-fi perspective. It holds you and builds to an ending that is just incredible. This may be my favorite movie of all time. Everything about it is just right.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Outstanding. A reason to come to the theater,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Worth watching. I enjoyed every second of it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I have watched Dune Part 1 100 times and to be seeing Dune Part 2 is so awesome… I was actually on the edge of my seat and almost yelled out a multiple times. Paul's speech in the south gave me goosebumps. I'm not exaggerating, this is hands down the best trilogy ever made. I will watch this again and again and again. There's not a movie I haven't seen and Dune is better than them ALL! Can't wait for Dune Part 3",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Watched it at IMAX, it was brilliant! Sometimes I even had goosebumps",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",One of the best movies of all times,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Everything from the score, editing, and cinematography is top notch. Denis is able to catapult off the world-building first movie to dive deeper into the prophecy Paul has to deal with. Paul's struggle to fight for the Fremen without fulfilling his visions is constant throughout the movie, and the acting couldn't be better.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",A masterpiece of a film. Everything about this movie is amazing.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Great story!  Kept me engaged the entire time.  Looking forward to Part 3.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Superb cinematic qualities. Perfect music score and magnificent costumes and acting.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Everything I expected and more. I brought my 10yr old son that usually has a horrible attention span. He watched it as closely as I did. Some scenes were so internally intense, I couldn't remain still in my seat. Only question that everyone should be thinking about now. How long do we have to wait for Dune 3 Messiah?
Please deliver us the Messiah, Denis Villeneuve.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Excellent Movie! Performances were great & Austin Butler's performance shows he has fantastic range. Could not take my eyes off of Florance Pugh, though.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",The whole show/story is awesome. Well made movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Staggering achievement. One of the best movies you will ever see,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Having to wait 24 minutes for the movie to start sitting through all the previews.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","In my opinion, this film transcends mere viewing; it is an immersive experience. I consider it not only one of the greatest science fiction films of all time, but also one of the most exceptional cinematic achievements. Since the release of Interstellar, I have not encountered a film that has elicited such a profound emotional response within me.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Way too dark and violent.  Celebrates gore and darkness.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Excellent cinematography and music. Follows the books storyline closely and really captures the feeling of it. Truly draws you in and transports you from the movie theater into Arrakis. Entertainment at its finest.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Great conclusion to the first installment of Dune.  The film is long, but goes very fast.  We really enjoyed it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Better than part 1, that is all",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I'm not a critic by I can confidently say that Dune: Part 2 by Far beautifully concludes a masterpiece started 3 years ago and an amazing portrayal of what the author would have dreamed to see on the big screen. The acting, special effects and the creativity has is simply captivating. Can't wait for the third move.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",A great continuation of the series and keep all the great moments going.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","While it stayed somewhat true to the books and original movie, the weirding modules was leftt out. Fabulous acting and awesome action scenes. Really did enjoy.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",10/10 All time favorite film. Truly a masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Part 2 was also good.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","It was great! The cinematography, score, action, the way the different worlds looked etc.  Acting, visuals and so much more were fantastic. The experience was absolutely amazing in IMAX. Definitely recommend seeing this especially in IMAX!",NEUTRAL

"Mar 3, 2024",Epic follow Epic.  Incredible film.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","MUST SEE! Absolutely amazing, utterly speechless",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Did the books an absolute justice, given the time constraints of making a nearly three hour movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Faithful to the book. Great action sequences.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","exceptional movie 10/10.....it is not such a good adaptation (6/10), there are changes in the story that do not make sense and very important parts have been omitted...I recommend reading the book to see how the original story unfolds, much better",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",Dune Part 2 was brilliant! It was so much better than I expected and I expected a lot.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",It was everything we had hoped for. A+ movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Stunning film. One of the best storytelling films since LOTR.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Overall I liked it but it was still a slow burn for most of the movie. Feyd’s character was refreshing.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","Oh it's so boring, it could be at least 80min, so it would worth it, but more than 2 hours, unnecessary",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Absolutely stunning!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","What a masterpiece! DUNE: PART 2 shines as bright as the sun as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time, joining the ranks of STAR WARS and many others that have changed the history of cinema for generations.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",The movie was really good. I just didnt like how it ended. Must going to be a part 3.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Denis villeneuve once again proved that he's incapable of making something less than epic.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",like the fact that it ended just like dune1 most likely going to be a third.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",One of the most spectacular movies I have ever seen! Absolutely breathtaking! ,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Action pack! Revenge History of Paul, gorgeous movie, definitely an IMAX must see!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Dune: part two is such a great movie. This is one of the best movie experience ever, true cinema.
Great acting, directing, story, cinematography... Everything about it is great.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I just saw part two last night.  I thought part one was pretty good, but part two was absolutely excellent. They did an incredible job of fixing the disaster that was Dune (1984).  It's not the easiest book to turn into a movie, and yeah, they changed a few things, but I don't think a better job could have been done.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The movie was great. For me it has good re play value. I can go back and watch it again. The action was very entertaining. I will say its not for kids, you’ve been warned lol",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",deep...and I fully understand pt1 now,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Movie Was Near Perfect, Great Cinematography and Sound!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Epic. The only word to describe it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Loved the action, editing & cinematography. The dialogue was sometimes cringy or borderline laughable when it came to the romance. Our protagonist and his mother become a lot less likable, but I'm counting on that changing in the third film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Awesome movie. I would recommend watching the first one before viewing. 5/5,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","As an addicted reader of the Dune universe, I can say it was an amazing movie.  There were items left out that furthered the plot, but I had hoped to see- such as the guild.  However, like the rest of the audience in the IMAX, I was stunned and speechless to the end.  Best sci-fi I have seen the movies in a long time!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I don't care what others will say, this movie was just a garbage that visually looks innovative. It is somewhat better than the Part One, however, the storyline was horrible. Complete failure in chemistry between characters, they all felt really forced with zero emotional connections.

And as a Christian, I don't think they should use such strong biblical words such as ""Messiah"" ""Water of Life"" in a very foul and odd context. Using these words was a pure mockery to God and Jesus Christ.

I won't even bother watching the sequel.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Setting up a great story if they continue with part 3.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","What a terrible movie. Scenes were cut short and had no buildup for the next scenes. The best scene was the main character capturing a worm and that's all there is to say about that. The so called ""epic"" battle at the end was horrific, the enemy literally didn't put up a fight, they got steamrolled by worms. This movie is the equivalent of the gaming industry catering to the casual gamer.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","variations from the book but still make for an epic movie. The first movie in a long long time to get excited about. definetly a ""must see""",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","This is no plastic, popcorn movie like marvel and so many other's. This is a beautiful, intelligent sci-fi epic! The first hour was perfection. The only nitpicking I have is the editing in the third act. Some scenes could have been shorter others longer. But overall this was FANTASTIC!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",I was disappointed by The script and how gratuitous the violence was. It didn't contribute to the plot or the film in my opinion.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Visually stunning.  Great character development!  Worthy!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Fantastic movie, first Dune movie was great and this one is even better!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Just one word: EPIC !!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I liked the movie, but it wasn't what I waited 2 1/2  years for.  the story strayed from the book a bit.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",One of the best movies I seen in the last 10 years it looks absolutely phenomenal visuals are some of the best i've seen ever. The sound is amazing! Acting is great. It seriously is one of the best movies in a decade I really hope they finish out the series.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Somehow better than the first (2021)! See it on IMAX, if possible! I really hope we don't have to wait 5-7 years for the third!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",It couldn't move any slower.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",It was a really great movie and adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune! Though the movie strays a little from the book it's really nice.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Liked Part One and really enjoyed the much-anticipated Part Two,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Absolutely phenomenal - story, scope, cinematography, production, casting, and that soundtrack! A refreshing reminder that Hollywood can still produce amazing films in 2024. Builds and improves on part one. Everyone ought to see this movie!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Denis Villeneuve has created a true masterpiece with Dune: Part Two. It's up there as an all-timer with iconic sci-fi films like The Matrix and Blade Runner. We can only hope that a third installment is already in the works. Don't miss out on witnessing cinematic history once again in the realm of sci-fi spectacle. This is one of those films that comes around every so often but leaves you utterly awestruck. So, head to the cinemas of IMAX for an unparalleled experience that will leave you wanting more.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","It's good looking and fairly spectacular, but I'll echo a critic who said we saw most of the same spectacles in Part 1. Our two leads are very pretty, but Zendaya has more charisma than Timothee in this one (though thank goodness he's uncomfortable with being the white savior). Good score and hissable villains.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",Compelling from beginning to end.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",One of the best movies I have seen in a long time! Epic storytelling! Can't wait for part 3,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Loved that they took time with the story, that builds to the action amazingly. Actors did really well, especially Timothy, Rebecca, and Austin. Great cinematography.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",I found it to be a little long.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Best movie I have seen in a long time! Great for a fan of dune or sci-fi l. I was  on the edge of my seat the entire time!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Like I read recently, this is why we watch movies, why we go to the cinemas. Dune is a spectacular experience!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Visually striking and breathtaking magum opus from Denis Villeneuve. Technically brilliant with stellar performances from the ensemble with the tour de force being Timothee Chalmet and Hans Zimmer's killer score.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Distilling a very dense novel into it's esential themes and bilding up the role of Chani's character,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Javier bardem being waste and some weak dialogue and are two of the few detractors from this outstanding epic.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Absolutely stunning an probably one of the biggest movies of our generation.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Dune: Part 2 is an absolute masterpiece. My jaw has never dropped more in a movie. The pacing is much quicker than Part 1 and the cinematography is just plain epic. The music score by Hans Zimmer is equally fitting, epic and magnificent. This movie demands to be watched in IMAX or an AMC Dolby Cinema!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",The visuals and score was amazing but in the end Tim's acting and really everyone's acting is the best they have ever done. Amazing.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Refreshing to see a film with a vision and doesnt cater to the lowest common denominator. An engrossing epic.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","This is Cinema, this is why we go to the theater ",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Well crafted movie.  Like that the movie wasn't gory or sexualized.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","One of the most amazing experiences i have had at the movie theater. Amazing scenarios, amazing soundtrack, amazing acting, the way the story unfolds and the tension. Could not be more impressed",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","In one word this movie is EPIC! These Dune movies are the best scifi movies since the original Star Wars. This is definitely a theater experience. I was sad I was not able to see the first one in theaters but this viewing more than made up for it.
The sequel is better than the original, and that is a high bar to pass for me.
The story is fantastic.
The visuals are stunning.
The score WILL be bumped on Spotify.
The actors brought their A-Game too.
Can't wait to see it again!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Full of character development, action and excitement. Didn't realize almost 3 hours had passed! Terrific movie!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Better than the first one for sure. I actually didn't mind the slight deviations from the book cause it kept me on the edge of my seat. I'm really hoping there's a part three because it ended right where it's about to get good!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Great Movie. Satisfactory and sufficient cinematography. Paced perfectly. Beautiful Visuals.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",My only complaint about this movie is that it wasnt three times longer so we can spend more time in this world. Absolute perfection. Plan on seeing it several more times before it leaves theaters.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Dune 2 was a masterpiece! Can wait for the next one.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Amazing visual and sound a most for movie lovers,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Delivered beautiful cinematic visuals with a great score.  The story is great, costumes, special fx etc...all top notch.  I'm a big Christopher Walken fan, but he was not well cast for his part as the emperor.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Visually stunning and more faithful to the books than previous incarnations. However beautiful actors posing and pouting. Zendaya still can't act. She better get all the roles she can because once she turns 30 that is all for her. Still wooden acting.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Denis Villeneuve has done it again!  While he made a couple of minor changes, probably to set up for Dune: The Messiah, this movie was truly a masterpiece.  Although the movie was over 2-1/2 hours, it never dragged and kept us interested all the way through!  Can't wait for the next!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Ok very good movie, great performance from TC, Austin Butler is freaking awesome, however some lack lustre scenes that really drag the movie out are difficult to watch. It's a very good movie but not a masterpiece in my opinion.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",Awesome representation of the novel even if it doesn’t get all the way to the end of the book. Leaves room for another installation!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Absolutely the best theatre experience ever, this tops everything, don't wait for streaming, find the best theatre near your and watch the movie in that, truly out of this world.",POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024","Good movie , plenty of well known good actors. Cant wait for part 3.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Together with the first part, this is the best Dune adaptation ever made. And it's great!

The cast is great, the story is compelling, the cinematography is beautiful and even at it's long run-time I was thoroughly entertained all the way through.

I didn't believe that Hollywood made movies of such a grand scale anymore. But I'm glad they do.

Nuff said. Go see it!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Fantastic. Most visually appealing movie in many years,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Excessively violent, very little plot advancement, had my eyes closed for over 20 minutes total, and story still ongoing. Somebody edit it already",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","The movie was just so slow and boring. The dialogue was also uninteresting with many long pauses in between. However, the SGI, the sets, and the costumes were amazing",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Beautiful soundtrack,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Very rarely do you see sequels outdo the predecessor but this one did just that.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Amazing achievement. Deserves all the awards. Please give us Dune Messiah!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Very well made, I have nothing to complain about, highly recommended!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",This was so well done. Probably my favorite sequel movie since Empire Strikes Back.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I'm not normally really into SciFi, but this was outstanding. In every respect!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","One of the best movie experiences ever! I've read the books and understand why some purists get upset, but I think all the changes benefit the movie and make it an unforgettable experience! Can't wait to see Messiah made into a movie!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Loved the action and special effects. Very realistic. Just didnt like that they changed the ending. Unless there is going to be a Dune 3

Definitely a must see movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Best Fantasy/Sci-Fi since Lord of The Rings. Differences from the book are acceptable and were expected. No major deviations from the primary source. Great acting and the best use of CGI in a very long time. I loved it...,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","An absolute masterpiece in science fiction, or in any other genre, to be honest. It has to be experienced to be believed.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Movie had me speechless. Will definitely be seeing it for a 2nd and 3rd time in theaters.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Very good story telling. Fantastic cinematography.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","It is a great movie. Probably, the best movie of the year. Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Timothee Chalamet, and Austin Butler were great. I believe if Dune: Part 2 is successful….this franchise will be the next Star Wars.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","One word : SPECTACULAR. 
This is truly a cinematic masterpiece to be witnessed in a big screen. The visuals of first movie were impressive but this one even better. Every cast member did amazing job. This is not an average sci fi where in every scene some ka boom action is going on, but in every scene is important to the plotline. The fighting techniques were so unique. And the music by Hans zimmer gives chills. My favorite character is  Lady jessica played by Rebecca Ferguson.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Again, I was a little underwhelmed. I still think Chalamet is the wrong actor for the role of Paul Atriedes. Lots of explosions, battle scenes, etc., etc., but they left out part of the story. It makes me appreciate David Lynch's version from 40 years ago a little more. It was more true to the novel. For example, the Weirding modules were missing. These modules amplify human sound into a lethal weapon. Alia, was already born with powers of a full reverend mother in the original. Also, this movie was way too long. Movies like Infinity War and Endgame move along at a much faster clip so you don't realize how long they are. This one moved way too slowly. Don't get me wrong about Villeneuve. I loved Arrival and I really liked Blade Runner 2049. This was a bit too much of a stretch. Cheers.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",It's a complete movie! Right up there with the best Hollywood has to offer. Nothing this decade has even come close.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Visually stunning, did not like much of the films revisions of the books basic plot points (compressing the time frame this movie takes place in is just stupid - Paul was in the desert for years, not a few months).  I though the first act was far too slow - should have pulled Feyd into the story much earlier.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",Will see this movie again. 3 hrs did not feel long at all.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Amazing sound, special effects, acting. 
Complicated storyline",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Big fan of the books and I've been pleasantly surprised at how  the writers adapted such a complicated story to a complete and cohesive screenplay. The writing, acting and effects are spectacular. The sound production alone deserves an Oscar. Must See on big screen.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Watched the movie on IMAX last night and it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. Masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The second installment of Dune (a third is in the works),  is visually stunning, contains more action than Part 1 and features new characters and better still, good performances by favorite faces, both new and long familiar, in those roles.  Florence Pugh,  Christopher Walken and Lea Seydoux all make memorable, if too brief, appearances in this deliberately paced and engaging sci-fi saga.  As he did in Part 1, Timothy Chalamet leads the cast effortlessly, giving another nuanced and emotionally balanced turn.  The rest of the cast, Rebecca Fergusen, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and everybody else (too many names to list here) are colorfully entertaining and believable.  Mr. Butler and Dave Bautista are especially chilling as members of the evil Harkonnens.  Whether you've read the novel(s) or not, you're likely to thoroughly enjoy this movie, expertly directed by Denis Villeneuve.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The movie is good. But it is not the masterpiece they promoted. In any case, the first part attracted more attention because everything was newer, more original. In this second part, it's just more of the same. And in the middle of the film, since there is not much more to tell, a void is produced that, to a certain extent, is boring. Maybe they should have left it in a single 3-hour film.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",when timothy duned all over the place i knew it was movie of the decade,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Outstanding effects! It's an epic film.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I watched the film at the cinema last night (where I would advise everyone to watch it) this was the best experinace I have ever had at a cinema. The film/movie/masterpiece is amazing. 

The visuals and dramatic effects were unbelievable. At times (you will know if you have seen it) I felt as though I was on a roller coaster and in the movie. 

The casting was phenomenal, to have the lead and supporting actor and actress as the Tim and Zen just shown how amazing DV is. 

No disrespect to them both at all but having walken, brolin, bardem, skasgard etc.... as supporting the supporting cast is just genius. 

I enjoyed the 1st film but it wasn't an 8+ out of 10 film until I watched part 2. Part 2 was a 10/10 in my opinion and after watching it made me think yhat part 1 was a 9/10. 

DV made the part 1 just as a set up and introduction to the 2nd. He didn't try to do something that didn't need doing because he was clearly so confident of his skills to make the 2nd a true masterpiece",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",This is what cinema is about. It's a beautiful film with a stellar soundtrack. The story has many subtleties but is very easy to follow. The character of Paul was a fun but also scary to watch develop throughout. It'll have you wanting to rise out of your seat with how intense it can get!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I love the whole story, I thought it was really well illustrated in the movie actors were great, the scenery was great dynamics of the worms and right in the worms. Costumes were fantastic. Also, seats were extremely comfortable. All the people running in the shower, really nice also and very accommodating",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Across the swing universe that is Dune there's a lot visually and sound that's are stunning in this sequel that requires you to have seen and understand the concepts from the first movie. 

Acting from Austin Butler as Feyd Ratha Harkonen and Christopher Walken as Shaddam who are visceral believable and fun to watch. 

Unfortunately Timothy Chalametee and Zendaya are barely believable becoming a couple in their lead roles and that's the sole negative to this film. At times their relationship feels hard to fathom like Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman wooden phantom menace and while it detracts it does not destroy the film... 

The cinematography is spectacular as is the sound. See this on 70mm Atmos sound if you can as the worm riding scene is worth the ticket price alone...  

Javier Bardem as Stilgar steals the show as he brings warmth and humor to his role.

Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica is also amazing.

At 2 hours 40 minutes it's epic and sweeping and will have you riveted most of the time.  I can't wait for the next one...",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","I want two hours and 35 minutes of my life back.  I can't figure out what draws someone to see this movie.  Part I was alright.  After seeing part II, I don't want to ever see another Dune movie again.  Painfully slow moving and fake alien languages requiring subtitles only make enduring this movie more heroic.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Really enjoyed it. Looking forward to the next one,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Truly epic movie!  The visuals were stunning and the storyline was amazing.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Très triste que l'adaptation soit si peu fidèle au livre, d'ailleurs beaucoup des scènes les plus fortes ont été laissés alors qu'il y avait vraiment un gros potentiel avec cette qualité d'image ( je pense surtout à Alia et à l'enterrement de Jamais qui m'ont beaucoup déçu).",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","....Villeneuve has a massive franchise in his hands...all he has to do now is nuture it. Epic movie, from the cinematography to the music to keeping to the original Herbert storyline, the second piece of this trilogy is damn near perfect. (hopefully he will produce everything thru the last two books of Chapterhouse.) Everyone involved with this production deserves merit. To George Lucas, J K Rowling, and the late Gene Roddenberry: you have company coming.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Cinematically this movie is flawless. Everyone brought their A+ game, from the acting to the cinematography, the directing, the score. Everything is perfect. However the pacing and plot is still slow. If you've seen part one, it's more or less the same. You would do yourself a disservice if you saw that but not this one. It's incredible what they've pulled off in film as a storytelling medium",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",Like Dune Part 1 ... Dune Part 2 was equally amazing both in the story and filming that holds as close as possible to the book. Cannot wait for Part 3.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",There was solid action.  Way to long and slow to deveope.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The movie was amazing and so refreshing to see! Denis Villenueve did a fantastic job at continuing this franchise, and I must say the coreography of the fight scene between Austin Butler and Timotheé Chalamet at the end was phenomenal. I was also so pleased to see Zendaya as Chani in this movie more than in the last one portraying such beautiful character. Last but not least, I need to put my congratulations to Florence Pugh, and the make-up and costume team, who did a spetacular job!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Phenomenal. I'm trying to think of a better sci-fi movie I've ever seen and coming up blank. The visuals, acting, and score are all amazing. Can't wait to see it again.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Get movie in all aspects, substance is everything and this movie has it all",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","It's a good interpretation of the Dune book but it actually leaves many holes for viewers who haven't seen previous versions or read the book. Would have liked to see more of Gurney Halleck backstory less of the emotional bonding of Paul to Chani we know he cares after first five minutes didn't need a hour of this, and the tradition of making fight scenes at night so no details have to end, you can lighten the scene and still understand its nite the audience will understand and enjoy of fill would be better.
My suggestion is watch Dune 1984 version first and then all the missing holes from part 1 and 2 will be filled in. Story is needed to appreciative Dune its not just effects.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",I can’t stop thinking about it. It was what good movies are made of.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The movie was too long, the ""climax"" at the end was actually anticlimactic.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","This movie deserves an Oscar, and I hope they don't forget about it since the Oscars are so far away.  The story arc (thanks, Frank Herbert), the directing, the acting, the special effects, the depth and complexity of the main characters, the moral story behind it all, superbly done!  It will go down as one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Just falls short of the original but if this is to be the second of a trilogy then it's a very solid part 2. The sound was the best I've experienced in a cinema!!,POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024","A powerful film, a masterpiece, with a deeply profound cinematic experience, one that I have never come close to experiencing before. For me, the best movie I've seen, by far.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","""Dune Part Two"" stands as a majestic work in the sci-fi cinema landscape, an unmissable experience that demands to be seen on the grand canvas of the cinema screen. This film marks a turning point, defining a before and after in the genre's cinematic history, reminiscent of the revolutionary impacts of giants like ""Star Wars"", ""The Lord of the Rings"", and ""Jurassic Park"".

From the very moment the first chapter ends, viewers are thrust into a relentless adventure, backed by spectacular visual effects, an exceptional cast, an already immortal soundtrack, and a plot so captivating that six hours would not have felt excessive. Denis Villeneuve masterfully introduces innovative elements, demonstrating a commitment and dedication that seem to elude many of today's productions.

To say ""Dune Part Two"" is a masterpiece is an understatement; it's a cinematic experience that those who love movies cannot and should not overlook. A tribute to the greatness of visual storytelling, it leaves you breathless and longing for more. A must-see.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Dune Part 2 is the ultimate Sci-Fi film. I was blown away of how this movie went way above my expectations that I anticipated. Every actor/actress in this movie did a phenomenal job. The highlight is obviously Timothee Chalamet, as he brings the best performance Ive seen him do and is really close of being one of my favorite actors in Hollywood. Austin Butler brings a terrifying and phenomenal performance in this film as well. This film still leaves a chunk of me disbelieved of what ended down in this film. So with this film already being a huge contender for Film of the year 2024, it is gonna be hard for a movie to be as this good as Dune Part 2",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","This is an audio-visual masterpiece you MUST see in theaters. You will later regret it if you don't.

 I've never said this before, but this is clearly on the level of Empire Strikes Back.

There are some things to criticize with the writing in this movie. I felt the battles in the first half came out of nowhere and seemed disjointed from the main story.

Also, a certain scene happens that makes me think, ""why didn't they just do that from the beginning…?""

But you will quickly look past these criticisms because virtually everything else about the movie is perfect. And it's an epic the likes of which I've only seen a few times in my life.",POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024",Seeing this on the silver screen is the only way!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The title says Dune but the movie isn't Dune.

Dune Part 2 doesn't have the feel, nor the story of the original movie or books.
Part 2 had very little with Paul Atreides becoming  Muad'Dib!
The ending was rushed and terrible!

If directors want to make their own version of remakes they should change the title!",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","While visually a very compelling movie, the deviation from the book in several areas reduces its impact. Also leaving a great deal to be desired is the ""performance"" of Zendaya, who apparently has one expression for all occasions. This could be due to the greatest deviation of character from the book, or just an inability to emote human feelings to any great degree. Christopher Walken was sadly miscast in this movie as the Emperor, a true injustice. The absence of several important characters in the book, most notably St. Alia of the knife, and an unnecessary plot of a religiously divided Fremen, utterly change the ending in a most unsatisfactory way.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Dune part 2 does not miss on any level. The action scenes are thrilling. The story is impactful. The visuals are breathtaking. And the soundtrack is flawless,POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024",Faithful to the original story. Excellent filmography.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The movie was impressive in terms of effects and costumes. The worms had never been more beautifully depicted. But this was a story of what Dune could have been, not what Dune is supposed to be. Biggest disappointment was how core characters were so drastically different from what they were meant to be,  which makes the movie flat and lacking any depth just a bunch of effects and fanaticism.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",There are a few moments while watching this movie I felt I was watching something historic happening in cinema. It's one of those films that will have longevity. Beloved for decades to come. Masterpiece for sure. See it! The see it again.,POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024","As I watched Dune Part Two, I had an increasingly sinking feeling. Oh no. What have they done? Changing things when adapting a book is expected. Different mediums need different approaches. But the changes need to make sense. Things I think are core to Dune are missing from Part Two. New things added don't work as well. I won't list anything here due to spoilers. I'll maybe blog about it in a few weeks. Maybe not. It certainly looks great, and I rated it 6/10 for that. Not for characters and story. You should see it, but be prepared if you know the book. You might get that sinking feeling too. I had a second viewing pre-booked. I didn't go. So disappointing.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 3, 2024","I really like the film, the special effects are incredible.
There's a huge differences between the first and the second part.
We'll see more action and an evolution of the reation between Paul and Chani.
The cast and the level of recitation are amazing.
I saw it with one of my friend and we agree that we've preferred to see what happed in the head of Lady Jessica when she has drunk 'the water of life', maybe that part is too quikly.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",An absolute masterpiece. How is this movie real? Just shows we have been used to sub par movies in Hollywood. Easily one of new favourite movies ever.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",I enjoyed Part 1 but Part 2 is clearly the better of the two.  It is one of those movies that you when you look back at it you were glad you saw it in theater.  It was able to keep you entertained to where you didn't feel that the movie is almost 3 hours long.,POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024","WOW! What a film!  The acting, the score, the special effects, the storyline, everything about this movie was great.  And now I cannot wait for part III.  This is the best scifi franchise since the original Star Wars! If you're on the fence about this movie go see it on the biggest screen possible!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Just as good as part 1,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","You rarely see a sci-fi movie with a descent script and acting. The cast was absolutely amazing. The costume are also a stand out, for some characters its not what you expect, a good example is the costume of princess Irulan. Everything is wrapped beautifully with breathtaking set design, location and cinematography. It will be hard to beat this movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The movie has an amazing first and second arc. It feels like a direct continuation from the first film. It does break from the book, but overall the tone and key messaging is there.

However, the third act feels rushed, like they are going through dot points to cover all their bases and rush to the finish line. The payoff feel forced and, dare I say it, underwhelming.

Notwithstanding some large breaks from the book that don't really help, in both character and events. It still manages to tell a complete tale.

This is a film that, surprisingly, I feel needed another part in order to be done justice. (Dune: Messiah could have been a part 4)

That said, overall, it is still a good movie. And I cannot wait to re-watch with the first in time and judge them wholistically.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","This Movie is a great Piece of Art. It shows more what a great Filmmaker Villeneuve is. And I also like the little Details, all the ""Spoiler"" to the next Movie (Aaliyah, Lady Fenring, Irrulan). And the Joke from ""Life of Brian"". 
So, for me, as a big Fan of the Book's, this Movie is a Masterpiece, which will re-define the Science-Fiction-Genre like Star Wars did Decades ago.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",I'm gonna tell my kids I watched this in theater 🖤,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Best Movie of the Year and Best Sequel Probably Out There. I'm so captivated in the world of Arrakis and the Twists in the movie are so cool and breathtaking. Timothee Chalemet is my favourite actor so far and everyone else does such an outstanding job. Believe the Hype! This Movie Needs More Glazing! Can't wait for Part 3,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Visually stunning and good casting. The story line and character arc was good and an overall enjoyable movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Well paced although at times the movie does feel like a slow montage. The cinematography and world building are beyond stunning. A lot of care and effort has been taken to draw the viewer into the extremes of emotions that Frank Herbert pushed through in the books. This is yet another stunning installation in a film franchise whose story was famously noted to be unfilmable. A must watch, especially while in the cinemas.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","An absolute epic masterpiece. Seen this in iMax, sound, videography, cinematography, storyline, acting, costumes,….it had an almost spiritual mystical feel to it, even more than the first one. Highly recommended, movie of the year for me.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",What a great adaptation of the book. I have a big imagination and this filmed lived up to my expectations and I didn't even mind the minor changes. Every performance was truly incredible and I could have had another hour of story and been happy.,POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024",To violent. Missed opportunity. The baron will give me nightmares,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",I had such high hopes. If you have not read the book...well I guess it's a good movie. If you have read the book and expected like I did that the movie was  going to stay close to the book you will be disappointed.  (Spoilers for here on). The book is about finding a way to NOT start a galactic was were millions die. In this movie he follows the path that in the book he fought against. Also water destroys spice not the threat of nucks.. The guild is not threatened. The houses that should have left decide to not support his rise to the thron. I feel this 2nd movie is more about building a franchise than following the books. I'm not even going to get into Alia of the knife. Or the fact that his mom is the one pushing for him to become a leader of a jihad time war. Or Gurney Halleck and the saudakar's parts in the second movie. I wanted to like it I really did. Did so well on the first one. First read the book 45 years ago. Been reading it every few years since. WANTED a better version that the 80s one. I guess I won't live long enough to see the next version come out.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","A lot of it does parallel the original Dune, but they have changed a few of the ending scenes.  Getting ready for part 3 to come Im sure.  They never brought up the voice weapons.  Hm dont know why they had left that out.  Still a good movie.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","Absolutely stunning.

A masterpiece that impressed me as a hardcore fan of Frank (not Brian) Herbert's work. What impressed me most is how impressed my non-fan family and friends were too.

Dune was fantastic. Dune Part 2 was almost beyond belief. 

Put a tear in my eye!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",This movie is a masterful adaptation of Frank Herbert's original novel as well as stunning piece of cinematic art. It builds on the wonderful base of Part 1 and takes off in glorious fashion; bringing to life Frank Herbert's Universe in ways that were beyond my imagination when I first read the novels in the 1980's.,POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024",It is entirely too loud.  Drags nothing really happens except blowing up things.  I think it is just a holding period until the actual story starts to happen.  The makers more or less made up their own story.  This is nothing like the books,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",This movie was great fun. There were some flaws but overall I loved it. I will see it again.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I would have given it 5 stars if I wasn't so disappointed by the role Zendaya got in this movie. It was an epic movie with a bit of high school drama, where all Zendaya got to do is look angry, pout and walk away angry with hurt feelings. I would have wanted a much better role for her. She did great, her role lacked a lot of depth.",POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024",Just watched in IMax. I must say this is the best movie I have seen in theatres. A must see in cinema. Cinematography and sound design is the best I have seen. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya is next level in acting and Denis Villeneuve brought his A game for this movie. 10/10 for me.,POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024","Fantastic atmosphere, spectacular images but the plot was ordinary and boring to be honest.

*spoiler alert from this point on*
There were quite a few of things very hard to believe (e.g. the emperor so easy to catch, guarded just by a handful of man) and a lot of scenes were so predictable (e.g. the duel at the end.

I very much loved it. I think it even surpassed the first one in greatness.
I absolutely recomend it!",POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024","Beautiful, confusing, bloated, and I didn't care if anyone lived or died. Strangely removed any real feelings of love, humanity, grounding. Humorless and big. Loveless and lacking poetic gravity. The phrases heard as credits rolled, holy lord. Too long. What the hell? This is a movie you will have to go pee in and anywhere is fine.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","You guys I have never posted a movie review ever, but I felt the need to make an account and post a review for this movie. This is quite literally the best movie that has come out in 10 years. The entire fucking movie had my jaw on the floor. The acting, the fight scenes, the love story, the drama, the score... everything about it had me literally GAGGED. I am so happy a good sequel like this has finally come out. The first movie was slow, but the second was a sci-fi cinematic masterpiece. I WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. GO SEE IT RIGHT NOW.",POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024",Great adaptation of a challenging book. Visually stunning. Excellent cast.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Great acting, impressive special effects, but about an hour too long. 

Great ending but I literally nodded off three times during the first half of this film. If you make it to the second half you will be rewarded. 

Just not sure the unnecessary whispered dialogue, and the plodding plot during the first half were worth the better executed second half.

Ostensibly, this movie wasted big concepts like how belief in God and religion begets self fulfilling prophecies that are a result of brutal clannish ways that are prompted by the slavish reliance on the hate that belief in God begets. 

Such potential with an amazing cast and stellar acting made insufferably long and ultimately not worth the 2.75 hours it demands of your time.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I can’t say enough about how spectacular the visuals and sound design are in this film. It’s a cinematic experience meant for the big screen. See it in a theater (IMAX if you can). The film also suffers from little emotional engagement, similar to the first one. I found myself emotionally disconnected from Paul’s and Chani’s stories. Nonetheless, it’s still absolutely worth seeing in theaters for the spectacle alone.",POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024","Wonderful big screen saga. Story was well told. Special effects were well woven into the story. If youre a Frank Herbert fan, you will be impressed.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","It's interesting how much I remembered from reading the Dune novel 59 years ago (I still have the 1965 paperback).  I'm not sure how well people who haven't read the novel would follow it.  The film is visually spectacular, and well-acted.  However the plot doesn't grab me as much as that of the original ""Star Wars"" film (later renumbered to ""Star Wars 4"").  Maybe I don't feel as much sympathy because I never took drugs—which are needed because of the Butlerian Jihad.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","Overall a great movie, stunning visuals. It’s true to the book vision, which explores the journey of a young man into being shaped by a destiny outside himself. As a long time Herbert fan, there was one sour note the director chose: to make the split between “fundamentalist” believers and the more rational, non-religious led by Chani. This was no party of the scope of the novel and co-opted the religious nuances of the novel into simplistic believers/non believers. And it  made Chani into a very different and frankly less interesting character than who she was in the novel.",POSITIVE

I loved the first one but this one, omg it's an another level, photography direction, music, fx sounds, costumes, color, etc, It was definitely worth the wait.
The movie is about three hours but I wanted more, I hope part III doesn't take much time to be released.

"Mar 3, 2024","I'm a fan, yet there were too many slow-motion shots of person walking in the desert with cape fluttering sidewise in the wind, and two contrived (didn't need to happen) fight sequences gladiator-style and at the end.  More generally, the amazing world-building (worms, ornithopters, desert survival, etc.) happened in the first film, but the second film served too much of the same for nearly three hours.",NEUTRAL

And this movie explained where they got the atomics. Original movie all the sudden last battle they got atomics out of nowhere

"Mar 3, 2024","I'm a lifelong Dune fan, having read all of the books several time, the Frank Herbert ones and the Brian Herbert / Kevin Anderson prequels, fillers and conclusion. This movie has the bones of Dune, but gutted many of the characters and plot points, all glossed over with stunning visuals and music. I don't want to create spoilers but any fan of the books knows what I mean.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 3, 2024",watched in imax after Dolby Cinema. and yes I was right. Dolby is way better at immersion with its surround sound and vibrating seat and floor compared to imax. yes the imax is bigger resolution more clarity but the sound and vibration of Dolby is the best experience for any movie I would say!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Interminable.  You needed to watch other movies to understand,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Dune Part Two left me speechless. This is a cinematic experience I won't soon forget.

I truly don't think there is anything I can say that would do this movie justice. It's both high art and a massive blockbuster. I'll never know what it was like to see The Empire Strikes Back when it first opened in theaters but I imagine Dune 2 comes close. A staggering leap forward from what came before it while also feeling significantly more personal. Brilliant, huge, revolutionary sci-fi. This movie is a generational masterpiece. We are so lucky to be alive to witness this movie. I have never seen anything quite like it before. For years to come, we will all talk about the wonder we experienced when watching this for the first time. 

Dune Part Two was vindicating. Like, less than five minutes into it, I sunk into my seat and thought ""Ok, it's somehow different (and better) than I imagined."" It kept that energy the whole film! My mind is scrambled with thoughts, so this review might be all over the place, but regardless the main takeaway is GO SEE DUNE 2! It's the cinematic event of our generation. Believe all the hype you see. It is the realization of everything I've ever dreamed genre filmmaking can accomplish, we haven't had a genre film quite on this level since The Lord of the Rings (or maybe ever). Within the first ten minutes, I knew we were within masterpiece territory. Once we got to the montage with Paul and Chani set to Zimmer's ""A Time of Quiet Between the Storms"" (my personal favourite scene in the movie), I knew the bar had been raised. And by the time we got to the third act, well, I can't even describe the feelings of excitement I had! The third act of Dune Part Two is perhaps the most staggering thing I've ever seen on a screen. I was in tears — I've never experienced anything quite like it in a cinema before! Dune Part Two is truly something special - it is the kind of blockbuster epic we don't see Hollywood make very often these days, and that is worth cherishing. I spent most of Dune Part Two slack-jawed in sheer awe of what was on screen in front of me. This movie is soul-shattering, and yet so exciting! 

As I was watching the movie I realized in the moment I was likely witnessing cinematic history unfold before me — this film is a generational masterpiece on the level of The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, Star Wars and of course The Lord of the Rings. This movie raises the bar to a whole new level - this film stands head and shoulders about 95% of current Hollywood production. I feel so lucky to have experienced a film on this level.

Denis Villeneuve's vision is on spectacular display in Dune Part Two, a bold journey that dives deep into the colliding tragedy of love and destiny. The visual language and soundscape are mesmerizing. You could feel the weight of this world sink in. The ensemble of Dune Part Two is wondrous, especially Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson, who command the screen and communicate so much with a single look. Timothée Chalamet totally raises the bar with his intriguing buildup of character, and Austin Butler relishes in sheer insanity. Everyone involved, from Hans Zimmer and his mesmerizing score, to Joe Walker and his terrific editing, deliver some of their most incredible work. Greig Fraser's cinematography, however, eclipses everything. The way his images characterize the world of Dune is absolutely breathtaking and the meticulous arrangement makes every single shot look like paintings with which I would gladly cover every centimetre of my walls.

Dune Part Two is a colossal action epic. The battle sequences don't take up a large chunk of time, but when they arrive, they're incredible. That final standoff between Paul and Feyd… tense doesn't even begin to describe it. This is a beast of a film, rewarding in both the thrilling setpieces and rich allegory. Denis Villeneuve's eye for action and iconography blends for a nearly flawless blockbuster, and an unforgettable cinematic experience. This is a transcendent cinematic masterpiece that demands to be experienced on the largest screen possible. Denis Villeneuve has created one of the best sequels of all time. One of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. Hell — one of the greatest films of all time. This is the Lawrence of Arabia of science-fiction epics.

Dune Part Two is an astonishing sci-fi epic that surpasses Part One in every single way. Denis Villeneuve has realized his dream of adapting Frank Herbert's masterwork to the big screen with the depth and scale it deserves in a tour de force we rarely see anymore. Truly in awe of all its craft from top to bottom and the perfect cast who bring these characters to vivid life. Timothée Chalamet gives one of his most captivating performances to date, certainly his darkest. He commands the screen like never before. Zendaya is the heart of the movie, while Austin Butler relishes in playing pure psychotic evil. But the scariest performance of all might be Javier Bardem who perfectly captures the novel's dangerous message of fundamentalism. 

In the end, Dune Part Two is a remarkable work of art. It's everything I want from cinema and sets a new standard for what we should expect from our blockbusters. It absolutely blew away my expectations and I can't wait to see it again. I don't have the words to accurately describe just how much I adore this movie. It transports you to a world of pure immersion for 3 hours and the performances are life-altering. I may see this 10 times in theatres. I can't stop thinking of how much I love Dune Part Two and how it fills me with gratitude for what cinema means to me. This is what the movies were made for. This reminds me of why I love movies. We don't get films this good as often as we ought to, so savour it. Never has a movie transported me to another planet like Dune Part Two. It is as immersive of an experience as I have ever had in the theatre and will go down as one of my all-time favourite cinematic experiences. I hope everyone gets an opportunity to see this on the biggest screen possible. There is truly nothing else like it. I LOVE this movie. Not only is Dune Villeneuve's magnum opus; it's the definitive sci-fi epic of a generation. A tragic tale of blind fanaticism and corruption. A spectacular, soulful, awe-inspiring masterclass of aesthetics and mood beautifully echoing Paul's turbulent journey, that left me utterly speechless! I can't believe we are lucky enough to have a movie like this! It left me with this beautiful feeling that I had just experienced something truly special. I teared up realizing that Villeneuve's Dune is real, that I got to see it, and it's a masterpiece.

There is before Dune Part Two and there is after Dune Part Two. I don't know if the world is ready for this movie. It is gnarly. It is crazy. It is audacious. It doesn't hold back. Wow. I can't believe it exists. But it does. And it's here! Bring on Dune Messiah!

Long live the fighters.

Long live Denis Villeneuve.

Long live cinema.",POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024",Incredible adaptation. Incredible cinema-tics. Incredible score. I haven't had a movie make me feel this way since first seeing A New Hope or saving private ryan. This may surpass both in being the most incredible movie I've ever seen.,POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024","A visually stunning movie, building on and improving on the 1st in the series.
There are several changes from the book but the alterations are not overly distracting and generally seem to be reasonable choices for the film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Watch this movie. The world building, effects, music score, acting, its sublime. Refresh yourself with Dune 1 and then be prepared to be amazed.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","It was visual and dramatic. However, the film script had too many unforgivable holes for this part. The tweaks to the novel in part one were noticeable but minor and tolerable in part two there were so many significant deviations and omissions that anyone who had read the novel or seen David Lynch's version would likely have found it as mysterious and illogical as I did. That being said, maybe someone who knows nothing about the book or earlier movie might find it solid and entertaining. It wasn't a waste of time, and it didn't have to be faithful to the source to succeed it could easily have been better.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","Delivers an intense experience that keeps you glued to the screen. The story builds on the first film with thrilling action sequences, never a dull moment, and all powered by an absolutely phenomenal soundtrack. It's a must-see for sci-fi fans.",POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024","Absolutely without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life. I felt like I was watching history in the making while at the IMAX showing. I never got to see LOTR in theaters but I only could imagine this is the same feeling that viewers got when watching Two Towers in theaters. This movie was so good it was almost a spiritual experience, with biblically immaculate story telling. The story, score, and cinematography are so massive, it seemed to even pass the threshold of what a movie could be and became something that was a visceral experience to witness. 11/10 would recommend EVERYONE to see it in IMAX.",POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024","#MovieReview #dunepart2 #DuneMovie

Dune is one of those franchise movies that you have to know the backstory, or you have to know the book series or these characters in order to completely understand what is going on   

This is a very long movie, but it's a good movie. It's not bad. It's very story driven and dialogue heavy. There's not that much action, there is plenty, but there's not as much as you would expect. 

Timothy Chalamet does a phenomenal job like he does in most every movie that he's in, but he's not always the vocal point even though he's the lead in this franchise, he is the main character, but sometimes he seems like an afterthought 

Florence Pugh still don't understand what her characters point was, she was there and gone and back and gone and back and then you're like oh wait a minute what's your purpose? 

Rebecca Ferguson is another lead, she, of course, plays the mother, and she does a fantastic job with what she's given, and she's more prominent in the film   

It was funny to see Josh Brolin, and Dave Bautista, battling because all I kept thinking was there's Thanos versus Drax 

Zendaya has a bigger part than she did in the last movie, but she doesn't have a gigantic part like everybody's trying to make it sound like, she still takes the backseat    
 
And then, the last character that would be considered a main character is Austin Butler, and you can tell that they cut his lines, or they did not give him very much dialogue, because when he does speak, he sounds like an evil Elvis. I am not quite sure what the deal is with that Elvis voice, and why he cannot shake it. ￼

Overall, it's a decent movie to build up, but just like every middle movie to a trilogy. The middle movie is always very dialogue, heavy and story building, and that's exactly what this movie was just like the twilight series, the hunger, game series, any of those series the third movie is always the big impact, the first movie, set you up and get you excited, and then the second movie is always the bummer. 

I'm not saying this movie is a bummer, I'm just saying that you really have to know these characters, because I have no clue who any of them are, and none of their names are something I can ever remember. So now I know that Timothy Chalamet plays Paul . But that's all I can tell you.  

It is worth watching if you're planning on watching the entire franchise. There has to be a part three, it just doesn't make sense for their not to be one. ￼",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I liked it almost as much as Part One which I found more immersive and had a better score. But this one has more action, will likely improve as the first one did with repeat viewings. So much to take in. Denis V's Dune has all the makings of a timeless / classic sci-fi saga. What a film! Has me looking forward to Dune Messiah in a few more years.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","This movie was amazing, beautiful soundtrack and did a great job keeping me in my seat. The first part was a 9/10 the second movie was a 9.5/10. Highly recommended!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The best movie I've seen for the last 10 years. The second part is even better, 
I enjoyed every minute.  Amazing and epic 😍. Definitely we will watch it second time in the movie theater.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",What a great film and a fantastic continuation of the first half of the story. Can't wait for Messiah.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Visually, beautiful looking. That’s it!  Full disclosure, never read any of the books. That being said, most film adaptations are capable of tying together context material from the book or book series. This film failed! Plot lines fell apart and contradicted its self. Failed to tie together character arcs. Basically it felt like an Art Project from Hollywood to impress themselves. Would also like to address a PSA: if you suffer from epilepsy be prepared to have an episode by the continuous dark to blinding bright lights thrusted upon you. If that doesn’t trigger it, the sudden shock of blaring loud orchestra music will! Like a young sibling waiting around every corner to scare you, your left waiting in anxiety for the sound stop your heart. The audio tech was tasked to saving the movie by jolting the viewers every 3 minutes with deafening sounds since the story couldn’t keep our attention. My advice stream it when available.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",I was asleep the entire time!!! It was like watching a lullaby...,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Really enjoyed Part Two just as much as Part one.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I loved the movie, it meets the great variety that we look for in science fiction movies, there are so many possible outcomes, the setting is magnificent, the dunes are beautiful and prominent. I look forward to part 3 with great desire. I loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Dune",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The perfect answer to criticism of the first film being too slow—Part Two is action packed, suspenseful, full of surprises (especially if you haven't read the books), and the score was chilling. The epic cast delivered phenomenal performances. Loved it from beginning to end and have seen it in XD, Dbox seats, and tomorrow IMAX!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Best movie I've ever seen,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",It’s a phenomenal film and easily a top contender for best movie of 2024.  Seeing Dune Part 1 (2021) is a MUST  to understand and appreciate Part 2.  Highly recommend seeing this in IMAX.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Amazing visuals, flawless performances, loved it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Great soundtrack and an unexpected ending.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The movie was absolutely stunning. There was never a dull moment and as a book reader, I think this movie was executed perfectly. Dune 2 is hyped up for good reason and it sure did not disappoint.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Just a cinematic and emotional triumph in every way,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",This movie was a masterpiece start - end was amazing… Can’t wait for part 3 ,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Far more intelligent than most of the current blockbuster franchises.  No Michael Bay or Marvel, hooray!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Intriguing epic storytelling showing the rise to power equal time for both sides.  Amazing and contemplative.  Don't expect Star Wars, it's the quiet introspective moments that give this movie the emotional gravitas it needs.  Easily one of the best sequels of all time.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Dennis V! Hit it out of the park with this one. All I can say is wow and please go see it in IMAX! ,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Absolutely amazing from start to finish.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Superb acting, directing, writing, cgi, all of the things! it really brought a great dynamic between the main characters and their change over time and their different responses /motivations to events. It made me love, hate and respect these characters all at different times in the best way. I ended up hating how a character was not because it was poorly acted or directed but because the acting and directing was so great!! You hate or love these characters because they are portrayed well set in a magnificent story!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",It was awesome!!! The visual effects were stunning,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Easily one of my new favorite movies 
The film is a work of art",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Worth seeing in imax,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Mi opinión de la película, es un sólido 10, es muy buena, después de verla me quede sin palabras, litelamente me quedé a ver los créditos porque no quería irme, es demasiado buena, en todo, en personajes tanto principales como secundarios, es muuuy buena",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Although this movie has almost a three hour run time, I found myself fully engulfed from the word go and never checking my watch. There is a different tone to this sequel compared to the first film, but its neither positive nor negative. There are a few loose ends left opened at its conclusion but its very likely that those issues will be attended to during the third film should it be green lit. Overall Dune 2 was exceptional movie but please watch Dune 1 first before attending and go to the bathroom before the trailers end.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",On par with Empire Strikes back and The Dark Knight as one of the best sci-fi sequels of all time. A masterclass in film making that did an outstanding job adapting a difficult book. The changes made sense for moving to a film format and takes nothing away from the message and tone of the source material. See it on the biggest screen you can find!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Holy schmoley. Dune II was incredible. Better than Dune I. Villeneuve's distinct style makes it impossible to look away as the film is, all at once, beautiful, visceral, mesmerizing and realistic. The only somewhat negative aspect is the acting of Zendaya…..she's pretty lame, but you get past it. The music/score and sound effects rattle your seat so go and see it in the theaters.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Gorgeous, Got me sucked into it from minute one till the end. Loved it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","If you are a fan of the book you will be a fan of this! As close to what I imagined it to be while reading the book. Understanding that they had to translate the story to the cinema and the need for Hollywood drama , hence the liberties they took to timeline and adding an antagonist that was not in the book.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Absolutely phenomenal,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",9/10 solid movie but still didnt crack my top 10,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Excellent Sequel. Great movie all around. i wished the last battle scene would've been a bit longer but still a solid movie!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","A work of art. Beautiful transitions, amazing score. Perfectly clear and smooth character development. Leaves you wanting more. So many critical points in all society. The perfect mix of space, fantasy, and war.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",We enjoyed the movie.. They tried to pack so much into Part 2 and  at some point we couldnt keep up..but the cinematography was excellent. If youre a Dune fan. Lengthy movie but didnt feel like it..,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","This movie is an absolute masterpiece. The cinematography and sounds design are fantastic and Paul Atreides is an absolute beast of a character. Can't wait for Messiah so we can see Alia in all her glory. The cast was amazing, just absolutely stacked. This film is going to win a lot of awards.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",AMAZING!! It was easily the best movie I've ever seen in theaters. 10x better than when Interstellar or Avatar came out. I really hope there is a chapter 3 to close the story out.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",This was amazing!!! Get up and go see it now. Right now! Go! Why are you still reading?,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",good movie to kick off the year with.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","Dune 2 was a disappointment. There were major pacing issues, and at three hours, you better keep things interesting. They really worked hard trying to make Zendaya this bad mofo girl boss, and it didnt work. Dune 2 wasn't all terrible. The villain was pretty good, and the ending was exciting—almost good enough to make up for the mind-numbing first act. Overall, it's a decent sci-fi movie but not nearly as good as the first Villeneuve Dune.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","This was an incredible film. The drama, action, CGI, acting, story and sound were all phenomenal. I can find no problems in this film other than the fact that the Emperor went to Arrakis where his enemies were. I think that was a bad strategy but it must have been for some reason I didn't catch. And if this is what happens in the book, I can't complain about accuracy. This film was absolutely gorgeous, making it narrowly beat movies like Avatar and Avengers: Endgame when it comes to CGI. And its overall better than Avatar. The action was just so awesome and the drama was just unreal. The movie was so nostalgic and powerful and I was completely immersed in it. This is the best film I have seen in a movie theater so far. Everything in it was gold and I expect it to win many oscars. The directors and actors of this film did an incredible job and this movie is a must-see and a perfect 10/10.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The performing 10/10

"Mar 3, 2024","Frickin' phenomenal! I didn't want it to end. Austin Butler, Javier, and Rebecca Ferguson stole the show. The others were great too. Best movie I have seen in a long time--maybe the best ever! How do you top a movie that enjoyable.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",This movie was nothing like I seen before,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Dune: Part 2 made realize that we are in the middle of getting another Lord Of The Rings-level trilogy.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Beautiful effects. Must watch on big screen. Nice storyline and complex characters. Denis Villeneuve did create a masterpiece with Dune 1 and 2. One of the greatest science-fiction movie. Bravo pour ce beau travail, Denis.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",More action and character development.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The soundtrack is so compelling, feelings flooding out every second of it. The cinematography and colour grade throughout the film is filled with passion for craft. Denis
Villeneuve is truly the DaVinci of our time.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",10 times better than the first.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Good story, lots of action and great choreography",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Movie too long. They spent too much time ""training"" Paul leaving less time for the meat of the story. Paul very hesitant to take on his role.  Don't remember Chani leaving Paul in the book, interesting segway.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I love the first one, and part 2 is even better. It was the shortest two hours & 46 minutes of my life. I could have sat there & watched for hours more. Very few movies are worth going to the theater to see nowadays. This is one of them!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Took for ever to get to the good parts of the movie. Could have been cut down to a 1hr 45 minutes. My friend slept through half the movie since it didn’t captivate us. 1st movie was MUCH better.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","One the best movies, I've seen a long time. Better than part one. I can't wait for Dune 3. 🙌🏾",POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024","I thought it was a great continuation of the series. It showed a lot more than the original movie. It told a great story, but I think they rushed the ending a little bit. Loved the Empress. Zendaya's performance was just ok. Everyone else did a great job.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Love it. Love the difference between the original and part2.,POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024",great sequel and I'm still confused and lost what's going on!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","What an incredible experience. Denis Villeneuve is a master of scope and storytelling and has done the impossible with adapting the novel. The cinematography from Greig Fraiser is impressive as hell as well as the sound design and the wonderful score from Hans Zimmer. The visual effects are soo grounded in the world that they look and feel real and doesn't look fake or out of place. The performances are great too but the ones that stood out were Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Christopher Walken, and Austin Butler who are just killer. Saw it twice on Friday and its my favorite film of the year so far.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Very intense ..  we want to see more,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Well beyond 10 out of 10.  Acting, cinematography, and incorporation of so many key concepts from the Frank Herbert's first book all exceed expectations.  With the important orientation out of the way in Dune 1, Dune 2 gets straight to business and it pays off.  I cannot wait to see it again.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Magnificent!  Deviates from the book, but yhe results may be better than yhe book!  A must see!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",One of the greatest movies of all time. A great balance of tragedy and humour.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","It strays too far from the book.  Their eyes are not even blue.  Paul's sister doesn't kill the grandfather.    The guild is not mentioned at all.

Best movie so far in 2024 by far.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Very good! We loved it!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","On one hand, I loved the movie. My heart was thumping the entire time and it did not feel like a 3-hour movie. Keep in mind, I LOVE the Dune story. I have been waiting for this movie since I saw the first one. I know all the lines, the music and even Chakobsa words. I love the arc of Paul's character and his inner struggles. I love how he comes to grips with his faith and how he finally surrenders to it. After all, that is what it means to be human. 
However, despite all this, the movie does not convince me that Paul TRULY believes he is the Kwisatz Haderach. Even in the end, when he gains control of it all, it still feels that he is doing only to avenge his father. He has taken the water of life and convinced all around him, but he has not convinced HIMSELF. Like Stilgar, we all see the SIGNS, except the ONE himself. I'm not sure if this is because of his love for Chani, who fights against the prophecy with every fiber of her being; or his hate for the Bene Gesserit and their calculated manipulations of mankind. 
I have to say, I enjoyed the movie, but I was hoping for a hero that despite his self doubts, will eventually make the leap and embrace who HE REALLY IS.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","Una belleza de película, la historia de Atreides y la metologías del mundo es espectacular. Parte 1 es buena pero parte 2 es la joya y parte 3 añañañ va que voltaje.

 It's a tough and long book to adapt and Denis nailed it for the big screen keeping the plot lean as it can be to make sense. 
The focus is Paul for his adaption. Part 1, 2, and (yet to be green-lit but cannot imagine why it would not happen) Final chapter 3 covering Dune: Messiah. 
Personally I enjoyed 1 and 2 equally. Anyone ‘bored' with them I say ‘no soup for you!'",POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024",Dune part 2 surpassed the first film which I thought was a difficult thing to do however Denis Villeneuve pulled delivered another epic film. The cinematography and layout of this film was masterfully executed. This is a must see on an IMAX screen!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Amazing! Make sure you watch part one before you go and see this, so you do not miss any details.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Boring, people, power, fight, weird",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Best film to hit the big screen in a long time!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","likely the best sifi movie made in the 15 years, brilliantly written , acted, edited , and shot, please Hollywood give us more cinema of  this quality",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Probably the best movie Ive ever seen!! I can only hope they make a part 3. If is a must watch in the movie theaters!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I'm a huge fan of the series, I read the book after seeing the first movie in theaters when it came out, even though I had now idea what was going on I still liked it. Now it has became one of my favorite books, and I have gained a lot of appreciation for the first movie, this movie is no different. Even though some parts were left out or changed. The parts they left out/changed fixed a lot of the issues I had with the amazing but flawed book. Overall an amazing movie now one of my favorite movies of all time.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Great acting, great visuals, great story, great sound design, great setting...not really much to complain about.  A thrilling sci-fi epic with great characters and a thought-provoking plot.  Despite the film's daunting length, some bits at the end feel a bit rushed.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The Dune trilogy is quickly becoming the third best series of all time, only next to LOTR and Star Wars. Artistically, Dune is trumps both. It is a masterclass in filmmaking, from the costumes to the music to the cinematography. Denis Villanueve will go down as one of the greatest directors of our time.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Slower pacing than the first movie, but filled with plenty of jaw dropping moments and beautiful cinematography. Must see if you were a fan of the first movie!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Dune: Part Two expands upon what made the first one a great setup that leads to the payoff that made Dune: Part Two as extraordinary as it can be and further exceeded my expectations.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",WAYYY Better than the first,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Wished they would have incorporated more of the good parts from the original, however, it was still very good.  Timothe Chalamet,  Rebecca Ferguson, and Zendaya are all very good in their roles.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","An absolute masterpiece. I can't remember ever sitting through a movie this long without it becoming slow however the way this movie was structured, I was engaged throughout the entire time. Incredible script writing, powerful performances from the entire cast, and don't even get me started on what the entire crew contributed to production. I'm happy to be alive during a time where I was able to experience this! 10/10 5/5 A+ if it was possible",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","A true blockbuster in every form. Stunning visuals and well paced action make this a movie worth seeing. Don’t let the runtime keep you from seeing this movie, every moment is worth it. I would gladly see this again !",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",first good movie of the year!  finally something worth watching.  visually stunning.  true to the books (as far as i can remember).  only weak part for me was timothy as paul.  he just doesn't have the gravitas imho to play a perceived messiah but he did pretty good.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Pretty good.  Awesome for today's standards.  Story is great, but it's from a book…. Action scenes are ok.  I think the allure is that it's fresh and interesting.

These are good movies, but….

I didn't walk away with any scenes in my head that said ""I need to watch that again.""

It's fresh, a new style, a new concept from an old book.  Provocative.

But that's all…. It's only a good movie because it's well made, and the book (that I haven't read) is a complex plot and setting.

The acting isn't stellar,  they all have screen presence but there's a lack of emotional impact.

Action scenes are OK, but not moving.

B- movie.

Ratings:
A = watch several times again sone day
B = watch once more
C = won't watch again
D = regret paying for a ticket
F = production team should find another job

+ = definitely
- = might",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Absolutely incredible film.,POSITIVE

"Mar 3, 2024",Breathtaking and a Beautiful masterpiece,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",One of the greatest films of all time.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I loved it, but to tell the truth, I loved the part 1 more, it just a little less mystery in part 2 compare to 1, yet is as entertaining. I'm hoping Warner Brothers will continue and give us Dune 2 (my guess it won't be part 3, since the first two parts covered book 1 of the novel), especially after showing some ""future"" that hasn't happened in this one. Can't wait!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",One of the best movies I've seen in a while absolutely must see,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Top 5 movie in my opinion!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Wow see it on the big screen,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","For a Part II and almost 3hr Movie, they left a TON Out, but I still enjoyed it!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",The pacing was way off... This should have been sooooo much more than it was. Huge let down with the worst film adapted ending since the original It.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",I did not like this movie. I walked out before it ended. Waisted my time and money.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","No spoilers but this movie left me feeling like, when is part 3 coming. It could have been an hour longer. The 1st movie was amazing and this one was better. Great job with this film.",POSITIVE

Rewatched Mar 01, 2024
Devin Cline's review published on Letterboxd:

""He who controls the spice, controls the universe"".

Summary:
*An angry and defiant Paul Atreides and Chani deliver many of the best and most intense moments of all. They both yell, glare and scowl all throughout. Zendaya's expressive, enraged eyes are on-point. If looks could kill.
*First-class cinematography, visuals, lighting, sound design, performances from its main cast, sets, casting, editing, costume design, dialogue, and directing.
*The 3rd act and final scenes are where this film shifts into a whole new gear of legendary greatness. Last 25 minutes were insanely cool.
*Timothy Chalamet, Zendaya, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Rebecca Ferguson, and Josh Brolin in particular all bring their ""A"" games. The entire cast pretty much all deliver at consistently high levels of greatness.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Did not follow the book or the previous movie.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Just an amazing Part 2.  Hopefully there will be another..........,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",I can't believe there is going to be a part 3.  3/4 of Part 2 was all talking.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",It was an awesome amazing movie. I just wish it stayed a little more true to the book and not the original movie,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I read the books and have seen the other adaptations.  This is by far the best movie version both visually and narratively.  A few edits from the book actually make the movie better!  The story and the characters are the main focus, not the special effects (which help tell the story).  Like epic movies, this tells a story and lends itself to discussions with friends and family.  I look forward to Part 3 and hope Hollywood makes more of these type movies that have excellent stories and acting.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","True to the book, with some excusable exception.  I did feel that some of the scenes with the Fremen went excessively longer than they need to be.  Imagery was fantastic a must see on the big screen.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Dune or DULL?

So slow, so many long and drawn out scenes, music is uninspiring.   Waited all this time for a snooze fest?

I almost fell asleep waiting for something to happen.  Subtitles would have helped for some scenes that were drown out with music.    

Way too much of the DUNE religion and holy war emphasis.  Fine for the books, but in a Science Fiction adventure movie?  

What happened to the Weirding Way and the Weirding Modules?

Seems the director wants the audience to stare at each scene three times longer than necessary.

There were some cool battle scenes, but only at the very end.

I'm calling it:    

                                   DULL Part Two",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Thrilling and epic follow up to the 2021 sci-fi thriller! Eager to see what happens next!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","As soon as you put the book out of your mind, you can enjoy it as a movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Great story line and acting.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Great action, beautiful desert scenery, fabulous acting and directing.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Even though it's not 100% true to the book or Frank Herbert's vision, it's close enough and both visually & contextually stunning. Well done!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","One of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. The visuals. The soundtrack. I felt at different times happy, sad, anxious, shocked, scared - every single emotion you want to feel at the movies. I felt the escape. Every single cast member delivered exceptional performances, regardless of the size of the role. Part One was beautiful and engaging, but it was a little confusing for those not already familiar with the story,and a little slow. Hoeven, it built the structure for the absolute spectacle of Part 2 and I will be waiting on pins and needles for Part 3. Denis Villeneuve is on track to create possibly the superlative saga that has blessed the silver screen.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","This movie was amazing. It makes the output released by Marvel/Disney the past few years look even more embarrassing, especially with the amount of money they spent. I felt like I was visiting a real world and place. The cinematography was beautiful, the score impactful, the entire cast solid, the story took its time while being engaging. I wasn't totally sold on Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya in Dune part 1 but was pleasantly surprised with their work in Dune 2. The practical and CGI effects were believable and not over-the-top and served the story. I actually liked the changes they made to Chani and Lady Jessica and thought it enhanced the story. I felt overall Denis Villeneuve made a fairly faithful adaptation, keeping to the main themes of the book. My only tiny gripe is I would have liked a little longer final battle and ending part in general felt slightly rushed. However, those are very minor complaints to an otherwise fantastic movie that will take its place in my top sci-fi movies of all time like Alien, Blade Runner, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and 2001: A Space Odyssey. This is a must-watch on the biggest screen you can find. I saw this in IMAX and I already want to go back to see it a 2nd time.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","I was really looking forward to this movie after the glorious first part. Sadly, it failed to enthral. The sweeping visuals were stunning, but the pace seemed somehow to be too slow and too fast at the same time. Lengthy scenes with little dialogue as Paul goes from being neophyte warrior to elite Fedaykin and acknowledged messiah so fast his unborn sister remains in the womb the whole time and his son with Chani never has time to appear let alone be born.  

The dull palette of colours used on every single planet became tiresome. My partner gave up pretending and fell asleep at several points and I was tempted to do the same. The end of the film as Paul gains revenge for the destruction of his father and House Atriedes should have stirred some emotions but it didn't and we left the cinema feeling deflated.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Good movie overall but wasn’t better than part 1.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",The movie was awesome. The action sequences were very well made and taken. Although the movie is long I never felt bored or zoned out at any part of the movie. Some parts of the movies looked like they were cut out as they suddenly transition to another part of the story but still a must watch in theater. I watched it in AMC dolby and it was worth it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Good movie but over hyped from what people are saying  if your looking for action might want to find a different movie cause it’s only in the last 45 min,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",Truly amazing movie. Superb acting. 3 hours and I wanted more.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Beautiful sound and visuals, great performances. Did not feel like 3 hours. I'm obsessed. This proves that Dune could be adapted.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",I liked the movie. But as someone who has read the Dune books many times I will reserve my unhappiness with the film to just one thing: Chani did not get mad ride off,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","Totally screwed up every major plot line going forward, made paul nothing but an angry kid out for revenge, even after what should have been major turning points! Well mad move that destroyed the plot and development!",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","The best thing I've seen in the theaters in the past few years. Please, continue on with the good work Villaneuve.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",So glad this was the movie I chose to see my first trip back to the theater and it didn’t disappoint. This is what I love to see,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Dune 2 leaves off where the evil Harkonnen just flattened the House Atreides quarters in the last act. We are left with a very weak opponent in a dismal 4% of Atreideans scrounging for food and shelter in an already deadly desert. Paul and his mother eventually find forgiving Freman and the story pushes forward. If you liked Dune 1 for its brutal and unforgiving clashes between Atreideans and Harkonnen, this sequel doesn't disappoint in the least bit. It goes deeper into the lore of what a Freman really is, you'll see friction between different groups among them, you'll see how they house the water of the dead in secret ""seeches"" (tunnels), and the trust or lack thereof between Paul and his mother and the Freman. We're introduced with the Baron's psychotic nephew, a welcome treat especially in the end, and the whole reason why the Harkonnens destroyed the Atreideans while in Arakis. I know I'm going full geek here, so I'll say this: it's a phenomenal movie. It's not perfect though, I think part 1 checkmarked every weakness in the telling of the initial story, but part 2 does leave you with some irksome questions. Some scenes where Paul accepts a potion (Water of Life that gives people like Paul and his mother, a Bene Geserit, simply a witch that can foretell futures) almost infinite powers through time, it is a bit rushed and we're left to just accept his transformation to rule. This was crushing to me and I hope they can release an uncut version of his growth in the future. Other than that, holy cow is this film beautiful. It is ""slow"" the first hour or so, so be aware of that. Usually when a movie attempts this, it's not that they don't know this, it's that they want audiences to become completely immersed in the world these characters live in. The score is godly, the visuals, again, just sinfully perfect, and the ambience it generates is sublime. We are witnessing a Star Wars-like event here with these movies, like Lord of the Rings after it. I feel the Dune series to be refreshing since so many movies the past two years have failed miserably. Score: 9.5/10",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",I was left in my seat utterly speechless. This was a fantastic sequel and movie all around.  You have to see this movie on the big screen and enjoy it as an experience. Cinema is back.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Same as before, but better an every way.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Absolutely loved this film! I'm a sucker for the book and this movie delivered on what I expected. There were some bug character changes but im curious to see where they will go. I was on the fence when I heard Walken was playing the Emperor, but he did a great job.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Incredible epic second half of Dune. Definitely want to see more.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Very interesting story with really cool effects.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Epic sound and visuals. Great flic.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Fantastic on all counts: casting, performance, direction, cinematography, visual effects, sound, music. A great experience at the cinema.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Would've given it 5 stars based off of the first 75% of the movie, but the end strayed enough of the way from the book that it affected how magnificent the climax could've been. What's sad is that it didn't seem necessary, nor did it add to the story, because the source content is excellent. The end felt rushed and disappointed me.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Boring. Almost nothing like the book. acting was good.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","Part two continues to follow Frank Herberts wonderful books beautifully! We recommend re-watching the first part before watching this second part. It picks up exactly where part one left off. But, could be confusing to a newbie. Our only disappointment is that it is clear there will have to be a part three! Hope it wont take very long!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Loved part 2.. great story..great music. I have already pre-ordered the bundle on Vudu.We can't wait to watch it again.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Been waiting for this. Not a disappointment. It's a must see! Epic!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Epic Film.  Very  great acting, set, and costumes.  Creates a whole different realm!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",One of the best movies I have ever seen. Best theater experience I've ever had. Dennis Villeneuve is a fantastic visionary and director. See this movie as soon as possible!,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Films like this so rare these days ✨️. Absolute masterpiece in cinematography, music, dialogue, polictal tussel of this monumental universe. 👏",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Unfortunately this movie should have been named Dune Part 2: Sand and Lullabies. The scenes of blowing sands and orange skies along with the lilting lullaby music was melded to a perfected amalgamation of nap time bliss. I have never in my time fallen asleep to a movie in a theater, especially not one I was eagerly waiting for. Going to have to rewatch it with mass amounts of coffee and sleep in preparation.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Well done. Being familiar with the book or re-watching part 1 will make following the story easier.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",If you want no stop action its land of bad. This movie way better than the other movies moves slow in spots. The guy that played Elvis almost stole the movie as the bad guy.,NEUTRAL

"Mar 3, 2024","This film, if you want to feel like a follower on Arrakis, if you want to feel the power, weight, music, story. This movie is the one! Watch it we need part 3!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Three hours felt like 90 minutes and I still wanted more of it. This movie is visually stunning. The sound effects had our theatre chairs shaking. Javier Bardem is the real star of this movie, providing fatherly advice with comic relief. I'll be watching this again and again.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","An overhyped 3 hours of sand, dust, fire, and noise",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024","Builds beautifully on the first movie, surpasses it, and sets up perfectly for Dune Messiah. Even the parts that diverge from the book seem to have been done thoughtfully.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Just as intense as the first one -- the action doesn't let up, the sound and visuals are simply mind blowing. We came to see giant worms, and we were NOT disappointed. Already ran into other moviegoers at the Chapters looking to buy the books. I'm excited to see if House Ordos appears in the next movies as I played Dune as a child on the old 486! 10/10!!! Try to watch in IMAX if you can!",POSITIVE

First film in years i was glad when it ended!",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Good movie. Great acting especially by Timothée Chalamet. Couple weird story changes but not so far off the rails to screw it up. Sound and choreography great. This will win some awards for sure.,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Dune part 2 is the type of movie that reminds you why the IMAX experience exist.  You do not just watch this movie you experience it, the visual storytelling is on another level, and it must be experienced in IMAX with its visual and audio fidelity.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","What cinema should strive to be! The vision is magnificent, at times unbelievable. Kickstarts a great 3rd movie and what I foresee future spin-offs.",POSITIVE

Watch it again and again.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",I love the casting and the pacing of this movie. It delivers the story and keeps you engaged. I was not disappointed.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Saw it at the Regal Stonecrest at Piper Glen theater. The movie was amazing! But the super-overblown bass vibrating the seats was way too much. We were sick of it before the previews were done! Turn that nonsense off. It makes me want to avoid that theater.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Visceral, deep, imaginative, thrilling",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Outstanding, It made me read the books, and that's impressive cause i don't read books. By the way, the final scene, without spoilers, i literally lost my breath. So, watch, it's worth it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Super fun. You'll want to make sure you've watched Dune 1 recently. But this movie's good.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",MASTERPIECE! Villeneuve is the man!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","If you have read the book, you will be rather annoyed with the meaningful diversions in characters motivation, although the action is in line with the books. If you have not you will likely enjoy the film a great deal, I suspect. The changes make it hard for people who know the book to enjoy it as much as they would have liked.  Were they made to fit the long book into a movie length story, that would be understandable, but they are merely taking the story in a different direction.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",The movie was so so. It had some fun moments but could/should have been cut by an hour. It seemed to drag along at times. The real problem was that the AMC theater showed 40 minutes of previews before the movie. 40 minutes!!! I have never walked out on a movie before it began but I was ready to this time. AMC you really ruined our experience. 40 minutes to show previews and tell us how wonderful and special you are is at least 30 minutes too many.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",It's perfection. Epic in every way,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Just saw Dune 2. I was absolutely blown away. Exceeded my expectations all the way. Every star in this film brings it 10000%. Timothee and Zendaya excel in this and Austin brings his A game in this film as The Dark Prince Feyd Rautha. He stole the show in every scene he is in. He is Terrifying in this. Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are great on camera together. Rebecca Ferguson is phenomenal as Lady Jessica. Everyone is top notch. This film is the cast of a lifetime. Casts and films like Dune 2 don’t come along very often anymore. This film is made up of the biggest stars in Hollywood. Highly recommend this movie. TRUE SCI FI MASTERPIECE. THIS FILM IS A TRUE CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE. GO SEE DUNE 2 today. Definitely seeing this again. Amazing work Denis Villeneuve.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",The perfect sequel. It is one of the rare gems that significantly improves on the first installment. Our generation's Empire Strikes Back.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Spectacular movie. I was so impressed with the visuals effects. Great writing and acting. A real masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","A complete masterpiece and excellent sequel to the first dune movie. The cinematography and score are immersive, well written, and allow for the story to be told in such a magnificent way. Dune: Part 2 will go down as one of the greats.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Movie was slow at the start and dragged on. Good special effects but not as good as MadMax by far. Dune 3 will be out for sure as the ending shows that.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Amazing! Loved it This movie was epic and did not disappoint! I loved everything from the cinematography, the music my man Hans Zimmer smashed it! The acting was amazing great performance from all the cast, particularly loved Austin butler's performance! 10/10 I hope we get a part 3!

Timothee is Oscar worthy.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","A worthy sequel for the ages, Dune Part 2 will leave a lasting impression on fans of the original novels and fans of sci-fi in general. See it on the biggest screen possible.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I literally created an account here just to review this movie. that is how much it impacted me. 
this is by far the best cinematic experience ive ever had. i had chills during the entirety of the it and sometimes i wanted to CRY because of how good it was. everything about it is perfect. the cinematography, the score, the acting, the pacing. not ONE minute is wasted, not ONE second feels boring. i could not take my eyes off the screen at any time. i wish i could drink this movie, bathe in it, inject it into my veins.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",On the edge of my seat the whole movie!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Epic, a work of art.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Still a few issues (some carried over from Part One and some new) holding it back from perfection, but this is an epic production only let down by some minor pacing and script issues. Score and sound design are once again astounding, with visuals and themes just as compelling. How Denis managed to make this cautionary tale even more foreboding than the source material is a wonder. Performances are brilliant, cinematography spectacular and VFX mostly flawless. Bring on Messiah!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Perfect, perfect film. Genius adaptation. I can't imagine it done any better.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I loved the first, but this takes it to a whole new level. Absolutely gorgeous, and such great character and storytelling. Highly recommend.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Epic film. Will vie for best picture, cinematography, set design, soundtrack and more",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Great story and both the casting and acting was terrific,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Dune Part Two is a fantastic follow-up to the first and was a much more gripping and exciting chapter in this story. Although it felt like there was something missing to take it to the next level (that being the highest level) 4.5/5,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Need a movie about the Harkonnen,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",It was epic! You have to to see in the cinema and IMAX if you can because it just hits on another level!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Epic Dune experience! Hoping to catch this on IMAX as well.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Boring. They had lost the majestic feeling of the first part. Pauls and Chanis love story felt forced and awkward. Zendaya does not seem to be very talented actress -mainly one sour expression on her face all the time. All worth seeing happens in the last 30 mins of the movie.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",It's rare for almost three hours to pass by and find yourself back on earth and not wanting to leave the theater.  What a trip part two was!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Unbelievable sequel to a fantastic movie. Loved Austin Butler’s performance. Could barely even tell it was him. Zendaya and Timothée were great as expected. I was also mostly interested in how Christopher Walken would be as a villain. And I’m glad he was better than I expected. And a great story too. Great film.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Long and boring.  The sound level at the IMAX theatre was so loud I was afraid my phone warning system would go off.  The main characters were not engaging and Timothy C's character very self important.  Meh.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",The watch really got hard after the midpoint in the movie. The directors didn't bring true value of emotion to the table in my opinion. I was on the edge on Dune 1 but that was not it.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Amazing visually and sonically,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","If a movie comes out and you have to LOOK for the tiniest of problems and you find none whatsoever then you have a juggernaut on your hands. This experience is flawless and brought my love of the theater back in full force.

This movies probably the greatest epic i have seen in the theaters since Lord of The Rings with a storyline akin to the best years of GoT and a scifi world that captivates you the way Star Wars first did all those many years ago.

See it on the biggest screen you can. Not even kidding. D-Box, IMAX, Dolby...you can thank me later.
Its breathtakingly epic and borderline overwhelming with a scale and intensity bursting out of literally every single scene. Some of the ""slow scenes"" just pummel your senses with scale and awe. You cant look away and you can feel the film feeding on your senses and transporting you into a completely different world.

A true modern Masterpiece of film
It has all but confirmed my loveloss for modern day cheaply made SuperHero spectacles.
It has made them all look like cheap childsplay in comparison

This is the film we have been waiting for folks.
It has finally arrived
The new standard 🙌",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Even though I haven't read the books, I still really enjoyed it. It's so well done, from the acting to the sets to the music.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Epic, probably the only film series I've seen that really follows the source material. Music is terrific, and to see one of the greatest books series I've read presented so well visually with acting that also keeps close to the source material was both thrilling and chilling.  Must see even you're not a fan of science fiction.  Bring on Dune Part Three.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I enjoyed Dune (2021) but it definitely felt like mostly setup and world-building. It even ends right when things are about to get interesting. Does Dune Part 2 deliver on all the setup?

Short answer, Yes! The story is incredibly engaging and thought-provoking. What makes Dune so special is that it isn't just a typical revenge or good vs evil or chosen hero-type story. There is more to everything, with very creative dilemmas that our main character has. It does have the typical romance story in the first act but it is handled wonderfully and then used with great effectiveness afterwards. The second and third acts are just phenomenal storytelling. The director, Denis Villeneuve, just pulls you into this world and manages to deliver an emotional rollercoaster experience that will mesmerize you. 

On that note, every actor is amazing. Timothée Chalamet had to convince the audience that his character was becoming a frightening leader in part 2 and he absolutes excels. Zendaya is great and has excellent chemistry with Timothée which makes their character's romance believable. Javier returns with more of a substantial role and he is magnificent. He provides some levity to a very dark story but does it naturally compared to the forced humour that is thanks to MCU movies. In terms of newcomers, Austin Butler gives a very top-notch psychotic performance as Feyd. He felt like a frightening presence. Additionally, Christopher Walken is a crazy casting for the Emperor but he absolutely works. All the returning actors continue to deliver terrific performances, and newcomers such as Florence are excellent additions.

Part 2 also has a lot more action set pieces. These sequences are a lot better than the first movie as they are choreographed and shot more clearly. The 3rd act has a very entertaining sequence and the final fight itself is an epic way to end. Greig Fraser returns as the cinematographer and he might be one of the best since Roger Deakins. Every shot is just beautiful and really captures the world of Dune perfectly. Hans Zimmer also returns and he delivers more or less the same epic music score as the first film. The set design is still gorgeous and the costumes are still as wonderful as ever.

I only have minor nitpicks and that is the movie can feel a bit fast at times. This is notable during the first act where it sort of breezes over Paul's initial time with the Fremen. I also kind of wished the Emperor and Princess Irulan had more appearances considering their vital roles. The character Thufir Hawat from Dune (2021) is also nowhere to be seen in part 2 despite his fate being unclear from the first film. I honestly wouldn't have minded if this film had 15 more minutes to add these additional scenes. 

Overall, it is rare for a sequel to be this good but Dune Part 2 is one of the best sequels. It delivers on everything the first movie setup while also being a stellar Sci-Fi film. Denis Villeneuve is one of my favourite modern directors and I hope he gets to make that final Dune movie that he wants. I know I will 100% be there to watch it if it happens!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",I loved part 1 and if you did too then no doubt you'll love part 2.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Visuals were amazing, sound design was an auditory feast. The story was beautifully told through great acting and remarkable scenes.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I loved it, it stayed very true to the books as far as possible! I hope a third one is made, the story is so vast and amazing!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",5 STARS FOR SURE!!!! Just as good if not better!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",interesting changes to make the whole thing more digestible for general audiences without going too far to often the hard-core source materials fans.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Dune Part 2 has AMAZING cinematography and visual but I felt asleep at some points during both Part 1 & Part 2. 👏🏻 Pacing is way too dragging and storyline is just average for me. This movie is so overrated. 🤷🏻‍♂️,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This movie is not for everyone. It's not a stand alone just show up and enjoy. You have to know the backstory and premise. It feels like it's 4 hours long with spots of action in between long slow parts. It has its cult following and that's the audience. Also it's part 2 of an obvious part 3 on the way. I saw the original way back when and it felt similar. Not even close to the best sci fi movie ever. If you like Interstellar or A Space Odyssey, and you know the backstory of Dune then this could be for you. I felt like it could have been a made for TV miniseries.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",Excellent film! Another great edition to the saga!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Ofcousre it is expected that the movie was gorgeously filmed and visualized. However I was most impressed with Chalemet's strong performance towards the conclusion as Paul is accepting his destiny.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","With a phenomenal score and spectacular storytelling and visuals, Dune Part 2 is an entertaining sci-fi film thanks to Chalamet's compelling performance and Villeneuve's direction.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Today I watched in Dolby ATMOS and felt immersed in the story. Next Saturday Im watching in IMAX and I cant wait!  Best movie Ive seen onscreen in decades. Decades!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","From the moment the film begins, you are instantly pulled back into the world of Arrakis and you pick right up seamlessly from the first film. The cinematography is just as amazing as the first film. I solid second film that will leave you wanting to sit through another 3 hours to see the House of Atreidis reign supreme.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Movie was amazing, a spectacular to watch, acting was perfect, never read the books and love the story.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",This was such an amazing follow-up on the previous movie. It expanded the world in some very amazing ways and left me wanting so much more at the end. whatever happened next in the story will be truly amazing. LET'S GO,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",This hit you so hard that you'll forget you're watching a movie it immerses you so deeply. The music is hauntingly beautiful and experience is thrilling. I'm still reveling from the adrenaline 24hrs later. 10/10,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I'd call it a great movie if it was its own source material. 

Why do directors and writers feel the need to bend/warp a timeless story to a ""modern"" audience. They obviously had someone read the book because to feel's familiar to the story Frank Herbert wrote. Why couldn't they just follow the book or come up with their own story. Don't buy the rights to make a movie based off a book if you are going to make major changes to character relationships and motivations. 

If you made it this far it comes down to this. Good movie, poor adaptation. Hopefully the next time around it's adapted the writers/directors read the source material more closely.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",a good movie but it did not do justice to the book.  So much was left out and changed.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",This movie was absolutely gorgeous to watch on the IMAX!! Loved it! Austin was amazing!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","It is just Epic. You can feel the gravity of the scenes and it is a great set up for a third movie. I can't wait, this movie is to a 100% Denis Villenueve Empire Strikes back.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Everything I like is a part 3 coming out I hope so,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Great pacing and entertaining,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Having read the books years ago, not what I was expecting but an enjoyable experience.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Really cool action - story is tough to follow if you havent read the book,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Music was great.  Liked the story.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Best movie I've watched by far, it was filled with action all the way to the end. The graphics and the cinematic scenes were great and I would recommend to watch u will not be disappointed!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Watching this is like having a fever dream. Story feels disconected, bad guys are made in such way that they are evil just for sake of being evil .
Choreography was just funny, as if I were watching children play ""fighting"".
Except for general vibe of desert scenes, this movie is just boring.
Imma put it on when I wanna fall asleep fast :)",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",A moment in cinema we can all enjoy. A MASTERPIECE!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","O filme está deslumbrante, com certeza superou o primeiro, com suas cenas mais envolventes e com a fotografia perfeita.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Epic picture! Great pace, awesome acting, the story really got me pumped. Zandaya was a bad motha @%#^×^!!! 
Overall best movie 2024 so far! 👌",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","As a fan of the Herbert's books I am so pleased that the creator of this film is someone who shares that love. And that is what this film is - a labor of love. Masterful cinematography, an unforgettable score by Hans Zimmer, an exciting cast, flawlessly combined to produce the best sci-fi film since the Empire Strikes Back.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Saw it in IMAX and it was visually stunning. Definitely seeing it again.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Good movie.  Not so much sci-fi as fantasy. Also  too long.  Worm riding was cool though.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",Very well done Part Two of the DUNE series.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","With amazing photography and soundtrack, Dune 2 is a must-see at the cinema. It can run a little long, but the acting and visuals keep you immersed in this universe.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",This movie was ABSOLUTELY amazing. A must see in Dolby. The sound and visuals were off the charts but the story was INCREDIBLE!! After seeing Zune 1 with that ending I was hooked but this time around I am absolutely going bonkers to see how they are going to end this incredible story in Zune 3. CANT WAIT!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Impeccable! Simply impeccable,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Cinematography was exquisite. Story compelling and acting was great. Just phenomenal. I can’t way for part III.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This is the worst movie I've seen in a very long time.  If you think this is any good, you need to get yourself checked out.  Chalamet is an awful actor and over does it constantly in this garbage movie.  Everyone else was ok.  This almost put me to sleep.  I'd rather watch paint dry then watch this garbage again.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","It was a really sensational and very well made live-action science fiction movie sequel. It had really flawless special effects, really brilliant cinematography, really marvelous cast, really wondrous characters, really amazing action, really incredible humor, really fantastic drama, really awesome adventure, really phenomenal music, really well done costumes, really splendid makeup, really cool sets, really wonderful visuals and a really captivating story. In my opinion, I think it’s going to be one of 2024’s best movies I’ve ever saw in the king-sized IMAX format in my whole life. I strongly recommend this film to sci-fi fans of all ages.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",I cannot articulate how much I love this movie!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Too slow. Very dry movie,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",I was impressed with Dune 1 and was looking forward to Dune 2 unfortunately it didn't live up to the first one. The movie dragged on with war scenes. They have a laser that slices through the spice excavators but then they use knives to attack the enemy on a scale less intelligent then a Civil War Battle. Stay tuned to Doomed 3 they're going to have a space battle just like Star Wars. May the farce be with you.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","One of the best movies i've ever seen, from the character building, cinematography, storyline!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",The Movie is a cinematic Masterpiece. I don't know what to say... Its just awesome. You should definatly watch it in the thatre... it realy adds up,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","If you are someone who was hyped for Dune 2, It Delivers! This Film not only has great World building (arguably better than its predecessor) but also it has great Character Building. The cinematography is no joke each scene is a spectacle made to be seen on the big screen. The performances are amazing, Timothy Chalamé is amazing as Paul or Ursul, Zendaya Guves her performance of a lifetime, for sure an Oscar worthy performance but the real star of the show to me was Austin Butler as na-baron no matter what sort of A24 movie or Martin Scorse type film comes out this year, Austin Butler gave the best  supporting actor performance of 2024, end of story. The direction of this film is so powerful as you can feel the amount of thought put into each scene. My one con of the film is there are a few things sprinkled throughout that are just plain old dumb, for example (spoilers) the reason the emperor gives to Paul for killing his father and his people felt very weak, like he sent out his whole army to kill the Duke of arrakis because he felt like the duke was a weak man, like what??? Anyway this is a must watch in theaters.Overall 9.5/10. Wb make Dune 3 as soon as possible please.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Great special effects on a grand scale.  The story moves along quickly among the various characters.  Looking forward to Part 3.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",One of the most ambitious movies you'll ever see. Every shot is breathtaking and thought out. The best actor in this movie is.... whoever the camera is on.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",LEGENDARY...One of the best films of '24. It's indeed was worth the wait. #DunePartTwo,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",So good had to watch it a second time in IMAX.  Epic!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","It was gooooooood!! Acting, visuals storyline. They did a ridiculous job!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",I enjoy how they're weaving in the relationships with the main characters.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Let me preface this review by stating that I've read all six of Herbert's Dune books, and dig them hard. Not bragging (because who brags about reading books except losers), just giving an honest take. 

So I took my girl to see part 2 (who has neither seen the first movie nor read the books), and here's the deal folks: 
there are three types of people going to see this movie. 

1. First time seeing/experiencing Dune narrative
2. Saw the first Villeneuve Dune film a few years ago
3. Read the book(s) 


If you are in the #1 camp, good luck fam. You'll have no idea what's going on and will have severe difficulty appreciating the plot line.

If you're in the camp of #2, you'll probably love it and gas it up like you're a ""Dune junkie"" and act like you know what's going on, but you won't. You're just a groupie imo. 

Which leads me to the third camp, #3. As an avid Frank Hebert fan, this film was PERFECT. It actually followed the plot of the novel much more closely than his first film; and when coupled with the incredible imagery and film score (thank you Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer) I can't deny that I was cheesing with delight the entire ~3 hours. 

Suffice to say, this film is an absolute GEM. BUT, only for the correct crowd. Don't look on rotten tomato ratings (94%) and go see this just because it got a 94. You will be disappointed unless you have a grasp on the storyline, preferably having read the first book.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",One of the best cinematic experiences I’ve ever had.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Amazing. I can’t wait for the third.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Mediocre at best.  Even though it was long it felt like the director just threw a lot of scenes together the hope of it being a coherent whole.

I thought part 2 was worse than part 1.  And TBH the more I reflect on the story telling and characters, the more I realize why Tolkien thought Dune was a bad book.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",I was very disappointed in the ending. Left so much up in the air. For the life of me I don’t know why this movie was remade. I haven’t read the book. Maybe the idea was to follow the book more closely. Maybe in 3 years there will be a part 3 to answer my questions.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","I am an avid Dune reader and I loved the movie, Dune: Part Two. So well cast and the special effects were phenomenal.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Wonderful film. While the runtime felt slightly longer than the first film, it was a great cinematic experience. It was visually stunning, and the sound was excellent. This movie is meant to be seen on an IMAX screen! It's better than ""Part 1,"" but only slightly. The acting was impressive, and I especially loved seeing some of the bigger ""blockbuster"" actors playing smaller parts and demonstrating some range.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Simply OUTSTANDING!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I loved the first part, but this easily topped that. Everyone involved at the top of their game, and this is easily in my top 10 films of all time, possibly even top 5. We'll be talking about this film in generations to come.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Most epic movie Ive ever seen.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Excellent....jaw dropping, cinematography is amazing and the story is 😮",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",What an epic and cinematic movie!  Loved it!  Need to experience it in Dolby or IMAX!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Movie starts off very well. At times it then becomes monotonous unless youve seen or read the books. it lost its ability to be a live action, entertaining movie when the mother starts talking to the newborn baby and nobody can figure out who belongs to which family.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","The movie is a treat in every aspect, just breath taking, can't wait to watch it again and again and again",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Loved the acting, cinematography, musical score and kept our attention. 
Need to keep track of first story a bit",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","So boring! Scenes are inconsistent and the story makes no sense! There is really no explanation how anything works. It's a movie that if you don't think about, is ok but if you think at all about things you realize is actually very dumb.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",It was fantastic!! Visual Effects were really really good. Acting was good as well. I honestly found nothing wrong with it whatsoever.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",OMG....I have no words to say about this movie. But one word that I'm definitely going to say is 'Masterpiece' that it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Great pace, solid acting, excellent special effects and beautiful cinematography.  I will see it again - well worth the wait!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Great movie Dune part 2.its 2 hrs.36 mins. Like the storyline.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Awesome, lives up to the hype.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Word of mouth people, word of mouth. Spread the word! Dune 2 is a cinematic masterpiece that will transport you to the spice flowing desert planet of Arrakis and more from the first shot, to the last. The world building feel so natural and intuitive. We get to spend a lot of silent and intimate moments in between moments with all the characters because of which the big moments feel like they were earned not given. The dialogues are simple regarding the religious themes and ideas of the Fremen culture so if you listen and follow carefully it will all make sense. Every single department of Dune 2 has given us, the cinema fans and the film industry ""a masterclass in filmmaking"". 
Dune: Part Two is a 2 hour and 46 minutes of cinematic masterclass.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","The film was absolutely phenomenal! From the visuals, the story, the acting, and the musical score. This movie definitely solidified Chalamet, Zendaya, Butler, and Pugh futures in the acting industry.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Arrakis is real. Denis Villeneuve made it happen.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Great movie great plor,POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",My family enjoyed this movie especially when Mahidi rode the worm and then when they called the worms.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Just a beautiful cimamatic movie that did justice to the original book!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Very well done.  Excellent movie.  I highly suggest you see it in an imax.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","While I do have slight nitpicks with the film, this is an overall fantastic cinematic achievement! It builds on everything that made the first film such a marvel and results in a sci-fi epic that puts most other blockbusters nowadays to shame!

"Mar 2, 2024",Way to take a great story amd utterly screw it up in nonsensical ways,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Best movie of the decade! Going to see it again soon. Amazing performances all around, the VFX show how CGI should be used, and the plot makes it feel a lot shorter than 3 hours. Anyone who was maybe bored at the lack of action in part 1 will have no such complaint for this.

...and for anyone wondering, yes you do have to see part 1 to understand what's going on.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I truly believe that this is the best movie of all time. Perfect and completely flawless in my opinion, the cinematography: perfect. The acting: perfect. The sound design: perfect. The fight scenes, choreography, spaceships, story, ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! Flawless I dare say.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",Round 3. IMAX was just on another level. This is the movie to watch cause it will only age with grace and still be amazing each watch.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Loved the ending. Maybe there is a part 3.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Dune Part Two was by far the best science fiction film I’ve ever watched. The thing about Dune, based on the novel by Frank Herbert is that director, Denis Villeneuve knows how to tell a story and he did that with Dune Part Two. The world that he created for the film: Arrakis, was visually stunning to the audience. The cast was amazing, particularly Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya and Javier Bardem was really good as Stilgar. Overall, Dune Part Two took Frank Herbert’s novel: Dune and he created an unattainable story. 10 out of 10. Epic scenes with the sandworms and the battle sequences throughout the film. Would recommend it. Loved the book and loved the second half of Dune. A must-watched masterpiece of storytelling and world building.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Amazing. Must watch.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","All Dune movies are slow and depressing.   One long pity party.   I prefere Star Wars and Star Trek types of sci fi movies.   Outer space movies yes, Dune movies no.   Walked out at the two hour mark.    Oh well....",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Spectacular. If you told me movie theatres were made just so we could see this movie I would believe it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","this is now my favorite movie ever, the story is inspiring, the visuals are out of this world, and the music, ohh the music, thank you Denis Villeneuve, j'espère vraiment que tu aura ton oscar tu le mérites plus que tout.🤯🤯",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Part 2 further expands on the tapestry presented in the first. This is brilliant.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",I liked the war and the sandstorm,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","A stunning second chapter that will surely earn some Oscar nods.  Not having a familiarity with the source material I was expecting a more satisfying conclusion.  

Must be seen in a theater to be a appreciated.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","If you are a fan of the novel and/or enjoyed Part One, guaranteed you'll love this one. I think you'll get actual chills. If not, you may find some parts of the film to drag a bit, or seem rather opaque, but there is still a lot to enjoy, I would think - there's a lot more action with less to set up.
I really hope this does well enough to bring us Dune Messiah, at the least. Villeneuve really, really gets the source material such that he really portrays the spirit and themes in a way well suited for cinema - it feels 100% accurate to the novel even though this is certainly not literally the case. I was annoyed, for example, by many of the unnecessary (and jarring) changes made by Peter Jackson et al to the Middle-earth films, but Villeneuve's Dune just... sings.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I am sure that the people that have not read the books will Love this Movie. As for people that have read the books, myself included , they will probably be disappointed by many areas that were emphasized to get a young audience rating. The ending Left a lot to be desired based on the book.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",Absolutely breathtaking from the moment the film stated to the moment the credits rolled. I can't wait to experience DUNE : CHAPTER 2 once again!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This is by far the best Science Fiction movie of this millennium. I will preface that if you did not like the first movie, you probably won't like this. The story is very overarching with cuts to scenes that don't follow Paul or the Freman. The story may be confusing if you're not fully invested in the story. However, this feels like cinema. The performance of the cast is incredible. The visuals and sound design are at a level that I haven't ever seen. I could go on with how much I love this film. But I'll stop here. Go see this film because this is a Cinema and if this doesn't win the 2025 Best Picture, will go down in one of the biggest upsets in awards history.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Very disapointing. The movie was slow and major changes done to the original material felt unnescessary.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Great movie. Love the story and special effects!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This a movie for the ages—sure to be one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best sci-fi films ever, and one of the best sequels ever produced. It's a zenith of genre filmmaking.

It's epic, it's massive, it's gorgeous, it's thrilling. Technically, it's perfect—the stunts, the sound, the special effects. It ups the ante over the first movie (which I love) on almost every level.

Denis Villenueve cements himself as one of the greatest working directors, and one of the greatest genre filmmakers ever—right up there with Spielberg, Lucas, and Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Exceptional follow up…I have no notes…we all loved every minute.  It's the Empire Strikes Back of our time..,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Great visuals with near flawless effects. Some weird narrative choices with Paul's sister and Chani.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Excellent story. Drags just a bit in the middle. Helps to have read the books. The ending was superb unlike Oppenheimer.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Just a great movie I don’t have the words that would do it justice highly recommend,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Amazing pacing, visuals, storyline, plot, everything.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Great movie, the word epic doesn't do it justice. See it on the big screen if you can",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Epic and dynamic, best theater sound Ive ever heard ! Period.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Dune part two was OK. Austin Butler made it BETTER. It was way too long of a movie — not one I'd buy for keeps.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",They wasn’t lyin. Phenomenal film!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",an amazing movie. one of the best i have ever seen,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Simply an amazing piece of art even if you are not a sci fi fan. I feel like I was transported into a different world and was on edge the whole time. I didn’t want it to end. I could watch this for 5 hours and still not be bored. Just go watch it in theatre ,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Great movie. Not one of the greatest like some critics are saying, comparing to Lord of The Rings and others, but still a great movie. 5/5.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, sh*t on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it-",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",Phenomenal movie with all star cast.  Plot  was true to the original. Exceptional cinematography.  Long movie but well worth it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Movie was awesome but IMAX picture quality was terrible and jittery at times.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",very good well directed very action good story line entertainment to the end,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",A few major differences from the book but WOW what a movie. I didnt want it to end. I will see this film at least 5 times at the theater cause that is where this movie needs to be seen. A triumph!!!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","As someone who knows the whole story, I wasn't troubled by the changes because some of what didn't end up in Part 2 will almost certainly be in Part 3. Some of the other changes were interesting, I don't know if they were necessary, but my partner who doesn't know anything about Dune was intrigued so it will probably work on the general audience. But for me, I don't mind changes in adaptations. The movie is as good as the first. If you find yourself disappointed, that's a you-problem.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Visually and sonically amazing. Plot is good and interesting. Saw in IMAX, very worthwhile.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",If there is one word to describe this movie is perfection from the visual effects to the story line itself is a masterpiece by none other than director Dennis villeneuve liked everything about this film,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Uauuu,just UAUuu blow me away what a moviegasm...",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",It was really great. I can't wait for the next one. :),POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","A Very Pleasurable Cocktail.

Dune: Part Two is an unmissable experience, weaving together war, drama, and captivating worm encounters into a thrilling narrative. 

Denis Villeneuve has made sure that it works as a therapy for the eyes with each frame so well crafted; Hans Zimmer's mesmerizing background score enhances the viewing experience & also complementing the Stunning Visuals & Grand Landscapes. The action sequences are improved compared to the first part & are surely more intense.

Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya & the other cast deliver their bloody best; the chemistry of the main lead adds depth to the storyline. 

With it's immersive world-building and flawless execution, it is definitely a larger-than-life experience that demands to be seen only on the big screen. Can't wait for Part 3.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I was riveted by the tension and action! Beautiful cinematography as expected, and the music never fails. I just started reading the book, and enjoy the changes the movies made, both mediums have their value. The first part established atmosphere, and this movie took off with action and character! Absolutely a wonderful movie! The sound mixing is incredible, and I love how the design team crafted the fremen technologies. Violent but not gratuitous. Highly recommend!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",A masterclass continuing to raise the bar in all aspects of cinema. This series feels like this generation's Lord of the Rings and was amazing in IMAX. Most changes from the book made total sense,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","The best film I have seen in a long time. I was on the edge of my seat for 2.5 hours.
The film exudes power. I will watch this film again many times, I know that.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",one of the best movies i’ve seen.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Stunning visuals, awesome sound score, and excellent acting make this every bit the equal of Dune part one. Although (spoiler alert) the Plot line Is condensed, somewhat meandering, and - at least in the end - veers away from the book, it sets up part three - as well as giving increased agency to a female character that was not as prominent in the book. Some may look unfavorably on this. I know I was a taken back at first blush, but I understand the directors reasoning, and it does really set up tension for part three. I was going to say ""the last movie ""but Herbert wrote several (not as good IMHO) sequels, and I could see this turning into a series of movie sequels albeit sooner or later, with a new cast of characters. 
Timothée Chalamet finally, finally captures the essence of Paul  (after futile efforts in earlier versions). That is what makes this movie, as well as the previous one, really work. And a tip of the hat to the Director. Tremendous vision.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Dune Part 2 does alot more to explore the culture and characters that were the focus in Part 1.

It's where it succeeds, it starts of plots that we see until the very end which wasn't apparent in Part 1.

The action is top notch and adds to the suspense the dialogue and acting we've seen in the previous movie. Where the movie lacks is a plot that still feels like prior knowledge to the Dune books would get most of your enjoyment. Alongside how corny some of the dialogue comes across which clearly wanted to sound more 'epic'.

I'm loving the cast who have invested more into their characters. Standout performances by Timothée Chalamet, Florence Pugh and Javier Bardwm. The cast did great and although some of the acting wasn't that good, it didn't ruin their performances.

It's an improvement over Part 1, it ended on a better note where I felt interested in whats to come and only the beginning act started to drag. It's an enriched movie where I'm sure they'll be more stories to tell in the future.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","Less true to the novel than the first movie was, but in mostly ways that really made the experience shine! Not as reliant on understanding the lore as the first. Phenomenally well done acting, choreography, and music.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I didn't watch Dune Part 1 when it came out and was lucky enough that my local theater(Vue Kerkrade, The Netherlands) was running a marathon of Dune Part one and two back to back! 

And let me tell you it was worth it! The movies are truly able to captivate the viewer and make them forget that time is actually passing by, those 5 and a half hours passed by so quickly, it almost felt like only 2 hours. The story and characters are well written and the special effects are truly stunning, this is a must watch for anyone that even remotely enjoys Sci-Fi stories!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",A dream come true. I could not have possibly hoped for a better adaptation.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Absolutely stunning, visually and audibly. Made no
sense of the 1984 story. Have never read the books, but this is easy to follow and beautifully made.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Great Cinematography, great story, Dune: Part Two serves its purpose by give house Atreides its honor and Giving freemen there 'lisan al gaib' .
But Comparing to its Dune: Part One, it lacks the curiosity .
Moreover there are where it gets slow and sleeps took over you nevertheless its a good movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","been waiting for Dunes' second chapter, and yes, it was well worth the wait. what a great sequal. I really could not pick anything bad out of the movie. Visuals and story line was on point. Just when I started to settle into the movie, another scene to put me on edge starts. Dune part 2 will keep you going start to end, and now I'm back at the can't wait to see what's next.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Absolutely blown after once again by this amazing movie series! The cinematography and CGI are out of this world, or should I say Dune?",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",Was even better than part one. Really enjoyable experience in theatre.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Top Tier Cinema here, IMAX really enhances the experience, and finally not used as a gimmick. Loved all of it!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Dune: Part Two explodes onto the scene, exceeding expectations with its grander scale and emotional depth. Villeneuve masterfully crafts a visually stunning experience, building upon the world he meticulously established in the first film. The action sequences are breathtaking, seamlessly blending practical effects and CGI.

Paul Atreides and Chani's bond intensifies, adding layers to their internal conflicts. Supporting characters like Lady Jessica and Stilgar shine, further enriching the narrative. While the near 3-hour runtime might deter some, and newcomers may struggle with the complex plot, Dune: Part Two is a triumphant return to Arrakis, offering a thought-provoking exploration of power, destiny, and the consequences of ambition. Fans of the first film and sci-fi epics will find this a must-see.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Waste of time. Nothing like book or first move. And they set it up for 3rd movie. That’s 3 hours I’ll never get back.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Everyone involved in this project brought their absolute A+ game, not A-game, A+. The actors are absolutely at their peaks with Austin Butler, Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, and Rebecca Ferguson delivering gripping performances. Villenueve's vision is realized and defined so well that you can't help but be pulled into the world and story he crafts. The visuals alone are worth the price of admission, and the fight scenes are extremely well done. This is how CGI should be used in modern cinema. I cannot emphasize to watch this on the biggest screen possible!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","The Kwisatz Haderach is long-awaited. A seed planted many generations ago. The tale of Arrakis and its spice is told with fluidity, gravitas, and epic action. Politics and manipulation over millennia are coming to fruition.

If you have not seen part one, watch it before this one. The actors and actresses gave terrific performances. This is a moment like the one we experienced with The Lord of the Rings. Be a part of the experience and enjoy the return to epic moving going.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",The first movie took about an hour to really get going. Part 2 does not have this problem and is fantastic from beginning to end. This is the best movie I have seen in years.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","A stunning, breathtaking and emotional movie, literally one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made. Great cinematography, writing and performances and of course Zimmer's incredible score. Diehards may be a bit irked by the liberties Villeneuve took with the ending, among other things, but clearly it was a setup for ""Dune Messiah"" and didn't take away much from the overall story.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","The acting and visuals are wonderful, but the director was so devoted to doing HIS version, he turned it into fanfic. The story sucked.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",I thought it was great. Action packed.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Visual perfection. Everything was a marvel, and I genuinely cannot wait to see the next one, but alas! I'm given no other choice but to wait. I'm stunned at how Herbert's Dune was so skillfully turned into cinema. And a masterpiece at that.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Have absolutely no complaints,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I feel so lucky to have watched this movie in the cinema. Denis Villeneuve has truly accomplished a magnificent job. The visual effects, performances, and storytelling were amazing.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",A sci fi epic unlike anything Ive ever seen.  Loved it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","The movie is very long.  And a lot of scenes are just made to feel even more so by camera just staying on a blank face.  I loved the effects.  I feel like the bulk of the movie could be better served with cutting out the long scenes and having more just raw action.  The acting was pretty blah as the average emotion was: ""I'm so bothered just being here talking to you."" by literally every Fremen in almost every scene.   Without spoiling it the director got way way more into the religious aspects of the major character and had believers and dis believers which was interesting.  Overall it's a fun movie to see but way way too long for the content delivered.  But they do leave it open to potentially go into the second book.  Which only SciFi and their miniseries have ever attempted to go into what happens after book one.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Great Movie. Really enjoyed this 2nd  part. Dont think the series is done yet either. Believe 3rd is in the mix. Cant wait.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Great cinematography, great score, great acting, great story, great movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Modern Star Wars in the sand,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Great movie. Everything was great, except for character arc development and dialogues. Wish Denis spent more time on it rather than on battle scenes. Very masculine movie with greatly depicted desert life. Key message of the book and next book was delivered to us in a simplistic and clear way, which I loved. Cast was solid and dealt with material given to them gracefully. Timothee was stand-out during transformation and entire act 3 of the movie, cause he was given solid material for showing his acting skills. Also, worm riding scene was beautiful and gracefully dealt by everybody including Timothee. The movie might be  not everyone's piece of cake, due to niche genre.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Dune: Part Two is a perfectly executed film. Greig Fraser's cinematography is just as wonderful as his work on the first Dune, and The Batman, if not better. Denis's direction is swift, sharp, with not an ounce of waste, it's all relevant to the telling. Hans Zimmer's score is electric and powerful. The effects are perfect. This film is expertly crafted, and incredibly well made. I could not help but be in awe by it for most of its run time. And not just with the larger than life moments, even with smaller more subtle moments hold as much weight. The cast here is phenomenal as well. Chalamet might be this generations defining actor. Austin Butler, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, everyone is fantastic. I love the complexity of the characters, the politics, and how this world works. That being said, I'm more of an admirer of these films, I can't say I love them or connect with them emotionally. As far as flaws go, I think about 10-15 minutes of the second act could have easily been cut, as a lot of it is repeated exposition and gets very stagnant. But the film ends strong.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Loved it!  Cant wait to see what happens next!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I think the first movie was better. This one was okay, but found myself bored in parts of it.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",The Dune Part 2 movie is simply wonderful.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","It is as a 5 star rating would suggest: a absolute must see. Rarely does such mainstream science-fiction make one think and feel as much as Dune can. The enthralling score and use of silence/sound, stunning cinematography, fantastic acting, and meaningful narrative all make this movie entrancing to watch.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I've just came out of the cinema feeling myself as a kids when I saw Star Wars in '77. In the last 10 years, or more, most of the Syfy films don't offer much emotions and quality content. There are still a few directors, such as Denis Villeneuve, that respect the audiences and have the the passion to work at a high level in cinema. Cinematography, production design, sound editing, sound and special effects hard to beat. I hope this Dune 2 makes a lot of money!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Riding the worm should have more details on how it is done,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Audio and Visuals are second to none. In that regard this movie is a masterpiece. However, it definitely feels disjointed and a little all over the place at times. Spent way too much time on Austin Butlers character. Movie really dragged in the middle and the ending felt rushed. It’s good but just doesn’t capture the magic like part 1 did.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Amazing scenes. Only two sets felt like CGI. Everything else was flawless.,POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",The movie starts out slow but the story does get good and picks up however it does have parts where it is confusing. The biggest problem comes at the end. The final battle just seems like they rushed through it. A lot of it ended up on the editing floor. It’s a dud. What’s makes it worse is they just leave everything open ended. No explanation or conclusion. It’s just figure it out on your own to make it end the way you want. That’s why it was so disappointing. If they concluded the movie then I would have been happier but walking away it’s like trying to figure out how it all ties in.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Epic sci-fi masterpiece,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",It was boring you shouldn't watch if you're a fan of older movies,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Epic that's perfect word to describe this incredible movie !
This new adaptation of Frank Herbert's book by Denis Villeneuve deserves to be seen on big screen on iMax for his incredible visuel effects and big scenes but also for its epic story little bit readapt for discovering new hero's and new characters interpreted to perfection by wonderful actors. 
This is epic, amazing, incredible, emotional and so much more to be described. 
Now the only way is went to see this on cinema !!",POSITIVE

So this low score is for FANDANGO... NOT THE MOVIE....",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Part one lived up to the original and part two fell short. The fight scene didn't come close to the original and was quite boring. The original dune kept me on the edge of my seat and I felt part two was a waste of my money.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","First of all, I haven't read the book, so I don't know if the movie is faithful to the book.

The movie is really impressive visually, the special effects are great, some scenes, like the one with the worms, are really impressive.
But the continuity of the scenes is not really good, the movie is too long and some scenes are boring.

Part one of the movie was interesting because we discover the world of *Dune* and the characters, but part two doesn't give me the same feeling.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Ya know when u get those ads for movies and it's like, ""SEE IT ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE."" Well they weren't lying about this one. It really does enter you into its world and everything about it seems magical. It's even better than the first.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",Epic.. You will never get close to the mountain of pages of these epic books. This gets you as close as you can while being accessible and entertaining as a film. Dune 2 may well be my favorite movie of all time. And dune will need to play right before it to get the full effect.,POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Really well executed. Outstanding cinematography, sound design.

I found Christopher Walken distracting, but thankfully he had few lines.

Also, I was a bit confused by the plot... in the previous movie, why was Paul trying to start a chocolate business and singing all the time?

Other than that, top notch.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","First, it doesnt feel like a 2 and a half hour long movie. It moves so well. Acting is fantastic and the visuals combined with the score are breathtaking. I would see it in IMax if you can. As brilliant as the first",POSITIVE

I appreciate not rushing to tell the story",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I liked the focus on the spirituality of the piece and the role of Paul as the ""messiah.""  The bene gesserit story line was definitely present.  I also thought they did a good job of showing just how mean the Harkonnen are!  I thought there would be a little more of the final battle in the film with the Fremen against the Sardaukar, but it wasn't a deal breaker.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",This is the definitive cinema experience. What a fantastic film.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Surpassed Part 1 by many levels. The only complaints i have is that it should have been longer than 2 hrs & 46 mins, and damn there's no IMAX in our city. Pure adrenaline from the 1st act down to the 3rd. Peak Cinema.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Firstly, this movie is a visual masterpiece. The techniques used will become the bench mark for Imax films.

Secondly, Rebecca Ferguson had the best performance in this movie. Austin Butler was strong also. Charlotte Rampling was the perfect cast for her role.

Third, the movie tries to pack in too much and as a result, ends up rushing certain portions. I feel in this way it is similar to the Dark Knight Rises.

Fourth, the musical themes could have been more prominent. I found it was the soundscape lacked melody.

Fifth, the source material is not exactly the same as Jamis' wife, Harah, is supposed to become one of Paul's wives (according to Fremen custom).

I think the scene where Jessica becomes a Reverend Mother could have been better. It wasn't the same as the book.

The movie could have been more captivating but in the end it just felt over stimulating and rushed.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 2, 2024",Loved it.  It had everything.  I knew it was going to be a long movie but I didn't notice because it was exciting from beginning to end.  Looks like another Dune will eventually come out but I was really pleased with the way they ended Dune 2.  It was quite an amazing film.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Loved it. Cinematography, sound, score, acting, all tops. I found the editing in a couple spots were off but suspect it could be fixed in a slightly longer cut. Near perfect film for me. 4.75 stars out of 5 if it were possible.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",I saw the first Dune and it immediately entered my top 5 .. when I saw trailers for Dune 2 I was a little worried they might try to go Hollywood to appeal to more people but that is exactly what did not happen … I feel this movie is a perfect continuation of the first movie… and now dune part 1 and dune part 2 are both in my top 5 of all time this movie is outstanding and needs multiple viewings,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Magnificent, epic, visually stunning and one of the best cinematography I've seen with sci fi. Everything was 10/10 . A truly must see film!!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Dune: Part Two is a cinematic definition for me. Although the first movie was majestic enough to entertain me, it wasn't appealing because of its nature. The world, the idea was not catchy. But the second movie is total craziness. Throne wrestle, character development, gigantic action. All together, magnificent. A masterpiece, the new Star Wars.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Stunning cgi, perfect acting and superb action sequences. A must see.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",A masterpiece.  Does not dumb things down for its audiences and is a class act in movie making from the acting to the enormity of the frames.  Villeneuve is a sci-fi master.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Dune: Part Two: A Triumphant Return to Arrakis
Buckle up, spice lovers! Dune: Part Two is even bigger and bolder than the first. Expect stunning visuals, epic battles, and deeper dives into the Fremen way of life. Chalamet and Zendaya are on fire, and the story gets even juicier with more action and character development. Whether you're a Dune die-hard or a sci-fi newbie, this one's definitely worth the trip to Arrakis.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","We really enjoyed this addition to the Dune series. It was very loud at times as the volume can fluctuate especially those high pitch notes, much like the first movie. Good action and a little bit of romance drama. Makes want to go read all the books so I know whats going to happen!! Cant wait to see it again.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","De lo mejor que hay en la Ciencia ficción. Algunos la critican por lenta o mucho verbo, afortunadamente no es para el público en general, todos tenemos distinto paladar, a pesar de ello, se reconoce por completo lo que es, una bestialidad.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Visually stunning and true to Frank Herbert’s original story, this film is epic in ways I was only dreaming of!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","A Visual Master-piece.

I had this thing in mind that no matter how hard the critic appreciate the movie. I won't get my hopes up even though Dune was so good in itself.

Having read the books and loving the Dune universe. I feel this lived up to my expectations. While watching the first shot of the movie. My eyes were glimmering I didn't really know where to look as there were so many things to look for. The color-grading in the opening shot was phenomenal and as the eclipse goes away you could clearly see the beauty of the planet Arrakis.

For the general audience-please have an idea of Dune Universe before going into both the parts, it is not just another movie for nerds. You will really know how good is your attention span during the course of the film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Disjointed.  Too much yelling.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",After watching this film I was truly at a loss for words. This movie captures the heart of film itself in all areas. I could go on so many rants about how beautiful and extraordinary it was. The cinematography was absolutely stunning. The actors were phenomenal. This is truly one of the best movies in this generation. An absolute must see that I hope becomes a classic!,POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","If I hadn't re-read the book recently I believe I would have rated it a lot higher. I didn't feel this movie was as immersive as the first one. For a movie that was almost 3 hours, I still feel like it only hit the high points. There wasn't a lot of dialogue but what there was had a lot of exposition. There were many changes and important deletions from the story that would hsve made it more impactful including the ending which i feel fell flat. I couldn't wait to see the first one again, but i doubt i will see this one a second time. Too much of a slog",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","Amazing, simply amazing.

"Mar 2, 2024","This movie was a cinematic masterpiece, an experience I will never forget watching, and will always remember. Definitely worth watching it In IMAX. Thoroughly enjoyed it, the cinematography was beautiful and the acting is top tier. I did not expect coming in to truly love it, while I thought the first film was decent, Dune Part Two is literally mind blowing. Timothee and Rebecca Ferguson performances are the true standouts. Definitely will watch it again at the theater!… Long Live The Fighters!!! ❤️",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","One of the best films I've ever seen, and watching it in IMAX was an incredible experience. It could have been a 4 hour movie, I didn't want it to stop.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Dune Pt 2 was amazing! I might be in the minority but I thought Pt 1 was incredibly boring. It felt like almost 3 hours of setup. Pt2 actually felt to me like a blockbuster film that I wanted the first one to be. I was extremely entertained and never once looked at my phone wondering when it was going to end like pt1. I would highly recommend to anyone. If others out there got bored with pt1 read a quick 2-3 minute summary then watch this one.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",A monumental epic unlike anything I've ever seen before.,POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","I did not like how the Chani character was changed from the book.  I understand other changes to simplify some story elements. The ending was a disappointment. Having Chani walking out and going to the desert was a horrible way to end it. I am a huge Dune fan and have read all the books, but very disappointed on how the Chani character was changed from a supporting and loving companion to Paul to a non-believing sullen character.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","The best sequel they ever made. This was a wonderful experience; acting, story, music, everything. I'm a big fan of Timothée, but in this, Austin's acting is also extraordinary. The story was told beautifully. It's more amazing visually than Dune Part 1. I feel like I'm in the desert too. I think this is the best movie that Denis Villeneuve has ever made so far. The casting is the best. I'd like to watch it again. Thank you very much everyone for this masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I'm 34 years old. Some will say I'm old, some will say I'm young. Regardless, in my 34 years, I have never watched a film that has gripped me the way this desert world has gripped me.

From the score, the casting, the visuals, I am left floored. This movie assaulted me. An exhilarating assault.

Just watch it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Dune II was a symphony of color and emotion. The contrast given to sharpen the character motion and action. It might be the best SC-FI movie ever created.,POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",The best movie I have watched.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Excellent acting and scenery. Impressive and realistic computer graphics. They changed the character of Duke Atraides from a charismatic leader to an almost tyrannical demigod. Not sure I liked that although it fit the tenor of the follow on books.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","I had been looking forward to the movie for quite a long time, but being a fan of the original books, I was quite disappointed, mainly because of the changes. Some of the cast did well, Zendaya, she was really good in the movie. But I just couldn't get into it. Really disappointed to be honest.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","A triumph of film making. The story, the acting, the music and cinematography, nothing compares. Go see it.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",Tedious. An hour too long. I want my 3 hours back!,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","With references to the cult of the Madhi (and many other Islamic tropes) Herbert continues the British tradition of worshipping the cultures they colonized. He does so with the self loathing patronizing manner of ""we have lost connection to god/nature/whatever that these simple natives maintain"".  Tired.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I think this is an excellent movie from the images, music, fight scenes and excellent movie setting.
The plot carries the true spirit of the Dune novel in the book
The actors with great acting all brought to me many emotions from pent-up suspense to suffocation to bursting. The ending of the movie is also an open ending, promising part 3 will be even more attractive and complete
There are only a few small minus points: the emotional aspect between Chani and Paul has not been fully exploited, the role of Princess Irulan was cut for a lot of time so it is not complete. In the middle of the movie, I wanted the pace of the movie to slow down a bit more to portray the characters' psychology as well as the reasons for their choices.
Combining the above huge pluses along with a few small, insignificant minuses, I think Dune part 2 is a movie worth enjoying outside of imax theaters
My Score : 8.5/10",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I consider myself lucky to be alive to experience this movie!

A total MASTERCLASS of movie making by Denis Villeneuve, this movie is simply PERFECT from A to Z!

Chalamet, Zendaya, Butler, Pugh, Ferguson, Bardem and everyone else are unreal and the score by Zimmer is out of this world!

Thank you Denis just THANK YOU!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I know it's a bit early to say but so far I think this is the best movie of the year, after watching the first movie I knew this one would be good as well and it ended up being even better. Highly Recommend",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Saw this last night, I've been looking forward to it since the first film. Wasn't disappointed. It's beautiful to look at, the cast were great, perhaps with the exception of Zendaya who seems to just play Zendaya, but generally just a brilliant cinematic experience.
Couple of gripes were deviations from the book, specifically the Paul & Chani arch and the missing characters, some of whom were in the first film & seem to have been cut in this one and others who just don't show up at all.
But otherwise, amazing. Going to see it again, but this time at an IMAX as I think it will enhance the visual experience even more.
Studios and creatives take note this is how you do big budget movies and a true cinema experience!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This is a modern day classic film , the theater experience for this film is immersive in the IMAX or any premium sound system theater , best experience I've had at the movies since the avengers finale. Dune Part 2 is one of the best sequels , a strong early  contender for best picture , the film itself feels grandiose in many aspects. Every generation has their iconic Saga's … Star Wars, Harry Potter , Marvel , Indiana Jones etc…. Dune has made its mark as the film series of the 2020's.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This movie also example for lazy writing. 
People are scary to Worms 1st part. They are free cab in 2nd part. How peoples are getting to it , how they connect and drive worm? 
Sand Strom played a role in 1st part explained as no one can survive . In 2nd part climax shown as biggest strom coming and it cause zero damage.
What is use of shield. In both part it is useless. If using it or not people are dying. Same apply to machine and vehicle all will explode. 
What is the power to emperor and why everyone afraid of?. Anyone can be become emperor by marry her daughter and no one stop. 
This story this old book adaptation. I accept. When I see this as movie now it seems like crossover of Star Wars and Matrix. 
Why this character? feyd rautha. In Colosseum he fight with shield against people who are injected and weak. Himself asking to Baron Vladimir why one was not inject. While leaving his planet an army shown and they are useless. 
How feyd rautha knows Fremen colony, it was said like no knows their hiding places. how Fremen fighters missed to notice that huge ship coming. 
Why Stilgar believes Paul is the one? To learn/understand Fremen life Stilgar ask Paul to travel/walk Deserts alone. in next Scene Chani training him. 
Gurney says that Paul family stored warheads which is enough to destroy whole planet. Ok. What is use of it? Used To destroy a single mountain. 
Much more..... Most 2nd part raising so many questions on both part. What is exactly spice why no where explored, how Rebecca Ferguson kidnapped in part one, what do people eat, water is precious? What shield doctor Wellington switched off, why devil hand on a planet showed,how Paul's note reached emperor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,",NEGATIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Dune is truly a magnificent film; I had thoroughly enjoyed the first installment and deemed it the best film I had ever seen. Now, having watched the second installment, I am truly impressed.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This is a complex movie to review and I wouldn't doubt it of there are divergent opinions here.

The first 90 minutes or so of the movie were just amazing.  Visually spectacular.  Tight plot.

But then as they started to get to the next phase of the plot it started to sprawl.  The whole scene on the Harkenen's planet with the gladiator scene was both visually spectacular (like 300 or something of that ilk) but also felt like a diversion.   You had characters (like Zendaya's and Rebecca Ferguson's) who would just drop out of the movie for extended periods as they switched to another part of the plot. As someone who read the books, I understand why they continued to follow certain plot lines.  But trying to keep it all together was hard.  I think in an adaptation that was less focused on the books, they would have just cut whole elements of the plot and characters out.

But for me personally, I think the epicness and grandness of the movie made all it worth it.  But I could totally understand someone else feeling like it was a bit of a mess.

One other thing — you can't look at this movie as a stand alone movie.  Ultimately they are creating something like a 9 hour long movie and they are just releasing it in parts.  So I wouldn't even think about this as the 2nd part in a trilogy.  This is just the middle part of a movie where the final(?) part has not been released yet.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Certain parts of this movie I can appreciate: the acting, some novel effects. But it was draggingly long, soaking in moments I didn't care about, and leaving out ones I did. I felt like I did when I was 8 and had to go to a long church mass, and this one was almost three hours.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","DUNE: Part 2 is Nothing short of a monumental achievement in the art form of science fiction adaption & filmmaking.  The greatest science fiction film that's not called 2001: a space odyssey, or interstellar. Dune: Part 2 is quite simply the best blockbuster of the last decade for science fiction films.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","I went and saw it first day got out of the theater. Driving home, I was like man they should've  brought back sting  it increased my appreciation for his interpretation. Apart from that the movie suffers with an almost 3 hour run time. I was constantly looking at my watch just thinking ""they're going to rush the ending"" my disappointment was complete at the ending  with zendaya and her unnecessary "" go girl"" moment  ptsd reemerging coming from the matrix resurrections  ending  apart from ""psycho Elvis"" and the ending which I prefer Lynch's version at the end of the day it all depends on how denis will end his run on dune if this sequel even matters or deserves the praise I had a lot of hate after walking out the theater but after remembering the main message of dune by frank herbert you realize where denis is pushing this story and see he is on the right path. My expectations  for the next sequel are now higher because  of where he's going with Paul. This is not empire strikes back. Paul is not Luke. Return of the Jedi could have sucked and empire would have still been remembered with love and nostalgia. Denis can still prove that dune is unadaptable if he messes up the sequel and dune part 2 will be remembered for a waste of time or wasted potential . Apart from all my issues it looks amazing in imax. I loved that the vision is there for sci-fi fans it raises the bar on what can be done by just a little bit. Paul and chanis charming love story drives this movie all the way to the ending. There is no human spider in this one but it creates a lot of visuals that I am still wanting to go see it again because of them. Timothy is giving off Jesus vibes, barden is carrying the supporter role with charisma, brolin is interpreting the rage for revenge from the first movie, and Rebecca is the best mom in this movie. The cast gave a great effort loved seeing the legendary Christopher walken  as the emperor.  An experience? Yes. But a flawed achievement in sci-fi flim.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","A fan of Dune the scifi mini series. They did a great job with sticking to the main story. The visual, cinematography, music, acting and character story development are amazing.

"Mar 2, 2024","A long story of epic proportions that gets better with every installment.  It's a visual treat with superb special effects throughout, from the grandness of the beautiful desert to the harshness and contrast of the Harkonnen style.  The plot covers religious fervor, mature romance and intergalactic conquest with a good balance and the cast of actors are great, truly bringing the story to life.  The musical score intensifies every scene and whilst it could have been paced better, what with a slow-ish start and a seemingly compacted final act, I was entertained throughout.",POSITIVE

I'm surprised that it landed well for better and for worse. Adding layers of personality in a one dimensional characters in the book. Overall Denis delivered a satisfying adaptation of the first book that rivals Star wars: Empire strikes back.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",This is the kind of movie why you go to cinema! Masterpiece!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",THIS MOVIE IS EPIC ON MANY LEVELS!  Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is one of my new favorite villains!  I cannot wait to see it again!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Awe inducing. Great sci-fi, great action, great characters, and surprisingly complex without feeling over complicated. Sadder than I expected.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",this is a sequel that not only met my expectations but exceeded them. i happily await the next movie,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","An absolute masterpiece, brilliant casting, amazing acting, and a director who isn't afraid to slow things down and show the magnificence of the surroundings.

Lawrence of Arabia meets The Empire Strikes Back.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Haven't seen such an epic movie in years. Really enjoyed it.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Amazing visuals and sound to experience in IMAX. Given its star studded cast and potential it's squandered through a disappointing script with inconsistent pacing. Definitely pails in comparison to the first. Dune 2 is being over hyped for what it really offers as for a modern day sci-fi epic. A movie of this magnitude should leave you feeling like it must be watched again and i don't think i could make it halfway through. Not a good sign.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Dune Part II closely follows the source material where it is able, visually representing Herberts' story by condensing the book into a digestible film in a truly magnificent way.
For those who have read the books, it may be disappointing. However, Villeneuve does a good job at catering to an audience who has no context and still creates a must-see picture film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Serious yet comedic, hopeful but heartbreaking. I just want to punch Paul's face for what he did to Chani.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",excellent movie all around. highly recommend,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","The movie plays with the idea of a strong man saving a helpless disorganised people, but then doesn't do the work to highlight how problematic the story is. The one dimensional characters and toxic rendering of masculinity does not help.
The only things saving this movie are the beautiful landscapes and the goose bumps you get when the music plays",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","A cinematic masterpiece, breath of fresh air in a time with hurried superhero movies and lack of depth. This second installment is better than its predecessor, much better. Acting is on point, and it will keep you on your toes for 166mins. Never a dull or boring moment, because just as you think it's getting a bit slow then it turns into full on action.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Dune part II maintains (if not surpassing) its first part's quality regarding the epic cinematic visuals and sound. Yet, there seems to have some flaws in the narrative part which makes some points of the movie too rush and some points unnecessarily too long that can be boring. In all, Dune part II is a decent movie that is overrated.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 2, 2024",Epic. Immersive. Beautiful. Great storytelling.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",I wondered a few times if it was the best sci fi movie I've seen in theaters since The Matrix. Phenomenal and creative.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Even better than the first, and the first was a masterpiece. Dune is widely considered to be one of the most difficult science fiction adaptations, and Villeneuve hit it out of the park.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Whilst visually stunning and the soundtrack was on point, I cannot get over how they changed major details with regards to the final part of the movie and especially the dynamic between Paul and Chani, which is completely different to the source material. Also, the exclusion of Alia and Thufir Hawat did not make sense,especially when they are important to several plot points.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","This movie absolutely the best movie in last years! In the final the movie I said just WOW! All things are good, Actors, Screenplay and music, visual and other. Thanks for movie Dennis Villeneuve!",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Very impressed, interpreted from the novel well.  It's the best movie in 4 years.​",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Watching the first one prior really helped me appreciate part 2 even more. It was amazing. Just go watch it already.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Dune 2 is perfect, it keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost 3 hours. The camerawork is brutal, every scene is a work of art. The composer's work is incredible, the music is a big part of this. Denis Villeneuve is a genius, thank you for giving us this.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Just as good, if not a little better than Dune part 1. Chalamet commands the screen with a dominant mature performance, and I loved Austin Butler as Rautha. Breathtaking visuals and score. Bravo Mr Denis Villenuve.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","MASTERPIECE!, DUNE 2 IS INSANE, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT A WORK LIKE THIS IS SO SPECTACULAR, TIMOTHÉE IS A BEAST",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This sequel is outstanding, with a well-told story, top-notch production, and excellent acting. While the script doesn't fully utilize this elite cast, the film is a must-see. Hans Zimmer's music adds to the film's grandeur. Dune can be both amazing and a bit boring, but it's still a great movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Not as good as the first one,NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",Amazing!!!! Everything about it was five stars! They didn’t hold back on excellence!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","The Best Sci-Fi movie of the decade. Doesn't matter if you read the book you will still understand every bit of information it has.

Would definitely recommend watching it on IMAX!",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","This movie was AMAZING definitely in my top 5 🤩 I got to see it in IMAX at the premiere. Great story line from the book, great actors, I can't wait for part 3!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Great Cinematography ✅ Awesome SFX ✅ Incredible music ✅ Epic Storyline ✅ My only gripe.. and I’m nitpicking here.. Is that it may be too long. It’s about 3 hrs.. you could have at least shaved an hour off and it would still be epic.. Overall it was great. They were treating Paul like he was Jesus, lol",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","Very well told story, superb acting, action packed, and best delivery of any of the series. Loved the actors, and feel good after the ending.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Part two was so awesome!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Dune one = 5 stars. But Dune two, despite excellent action and visual/sonic impact, is miserable. Frank Herbert had a masterful nearly perfect plot that the screenplay completely disregarded solely for the purpose of setting the stage for an action packed sequel. All the masterful complexity of the original plot turned to dust. All the depth of the characters obliterated (and some, like Alia, gone completely).",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Fantastic production, better than the first",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Phenomenal !! See it on the biggest screen you can! I have never seen a movie multiple times at the theatre until Dune. Will see it a third time in IMAX next week on the other side of Australia since there isn't one in Perth. 
Can't recommend enough!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Visually stunning... and that's it. 

If you've read the books, you'll be disappointed, or you should be. If you haven't, you'll probably like this movie a lot more than you should. Frank Herbert's Dune is a masterpiece for a reason. Why Villeneuve felt it needed to be rewritten is beyond me. Gone are the subtle complexities of manipulation and intrique.  We get one line as a nod to them, which literally says plans within plans, but we never seeeeee any of those. Not even the most blatant one, where the Beast Raban is intended to brutalize the population of Arrakis so that  Feyd-Rautha can replace him as a more ""benevolent"" dictator.  

This is just another example of spectacle over story, though done better than most. Read the book if you want to know how good the movie could have been.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Intriguing. Better than the first!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Better than part 1 and part 1 was already great.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Nothing wrong with this film whatsoever! The script, choreography, cinematography, you name it everything was perfectly set up and don’t even get me started with Timothée Chalamet!!! INSANE",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","One of the top 10 greatest movies of all time IMO. It's also IMO the greatest IMAX movie ever made, the Cinematography, sound design, cast, and Denis Villanueves amazing direction all shines here!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Great cinematic and music is captivating!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Masterpiece. No other words,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Even better than the first one, Villeneuve has somehow captured that raw feeling of reading Frank Hebert's Dune for the first time on film. The effects as well as the character writing, particularly for Stilgar, are spectacular. I would recommend 10/10 can't wait to see it again.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",TOO much talking. Needs more action since its almost a 3 hr long movie.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Incredible directing, acting, cinematography, sound and just sheer scale. This is such a refreshing ""blockbuster"" the world was due for. I agree with other folks that this needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Some of the story felt rushed but they didn't have a choice given the depth of the source material. Hoping this crushes the box office and we get Dune 3.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Dune: Part Two is nothing short of a MASTERPIECE! I haven't known anything about the dune universe going into the first movie, then the first one got me hooked! This is probably one of the best sequels of all time! The action, the drama, the story, and cinematography are all 10/10. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this film. I would recommend this to anyone, this is absolute Sci-Fi perfection! This movie made me want to read the book, so immediately afterwards I placed a hold on it!",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Dune Part II: I missed my IMAX show time, but I got to see it in Xd. Xd was very very good, including the sound system. Not too loud, not too soft. The cast is 100% solid. I was dubious about Chani Kynes (Zendaya), but the chemistry works with Paul (Timothée Chalamet). One gets a bit more into the goings of the lifestyle of the Fremen, which is solid. I hope we have an extended version in the works. Also, I am hopeful we can purchase a Blu-Ray CD. Both Dune and Dune II are appropriate for modern Sci-Fi libraries. Also, there are huge opportunities for swag.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",This is Denis Villeneuve at his best. This is what modern sci-fi is meant to be. The marriage of the music and cinematography is *chef's kiss*.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I mean, there really was nothing bad to say about this one. Didn't really know what to expect from watching the first Dune just last night, and this one far exceeded it. The only gripe I only had was that it felt like it dragged early, but it was made up in the end. Fantastic film!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Visually the movie is beautiful. Some great performances. Overall, some of the departures from the book were very hard to swallow. 

Spoilers ahead
…

In the book, what was most powerful about the Fremen was their unity in tradition and practice. The movie takes a major curve ball very early with religious divide among the Fremen. Specifically, the water of life ritual was something I was extremely looking forward to. The scene of Paul witnessing his mother go through the trial, the entire seitch watching, the sharing of the water. Instead we got the younger generation's open mockery of the practice, and it was so jarring. I understand the need to push the theme for a movie differently than a book, but it came across very heavy handed. I think it's more powerful to see the religious divide happen after Paul has been emperor for many years in Messiah. The people then realize how their religion had been manipulated during/after the jihad. Paul used them for his own purposes and many of them died as a result. Instead some of them already knew they were getting used, then got convinced he was the messiah, then are going to be turned again?? The Bene Gesserit are displayed as so heavy handed as well and far less skilled than the books. All of Jessica's dialogue was extremely out of character.  We also miss the fact the Paul was still undergoing extensive Bene Gesserit training while they were with the Fremen. The way they were saying out loud to use the Fremen to their advantage while they were all right there was shocking. Stilgar reduced to comedic relief… No Harah just the random mean girl who was friends with Chani. Chani not being Sayyadina??? Chani overall felt very out of character compared to the book as well. The water discipline was SLACK! I know I did not just see steam leaving the coffee pot in the open air! No face covers! Hello? Are we still on Dune with Fremen?? That's the biggest thing??!! I can't remember if this was said exactly in the book but Reverend Mother saying Princes Irulan was her brightest student and then propping her up to be that girl but in the book she was the worst player in the court Paul created…. Ignoring the spice cycle and just threatening to nuke the spice fields… Ignoring the commercial aspect of Paul's takeover…. The tone was more ""our rag tag team of rebel fighters go guns blazing with this new guy we just met and his mom"" and not ""our disguised and sophisticated population of millions of military disciplined religious warriors are heavily psychologically conditioned for centuries and manipulated to the whims of a drug fueled ultra-neurodivergent human prodigy to take over the entire galaxy""
I will say, house Harkonnen was very well displayed. The totalitarian, violent, and sexual nature of their society was perfectly depicted as were the characters.
The majesty of the Sandworms and the end battle were very well done.
I will agree with the decision to not have a three year old Alia kill Baron Harkonnen as I think it would have ended up like a Renesme situation lol.
They swept away some of the grandeur and mystic that was so beautiful about the first film, and I feel like watching them back to back would feel a bit incongruent. Again, if this was intentionally done to display the themes of the story I think it was overdone and doesn't leave me very excited about the content of any potential sequels.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Warning spoilers:

The visuals were stunning and the action was great.  I didn't like Zendaya's acting, it was weak and she just seemed like an angry teenager instead of an adult.  There were parts taken out and it seemed callous.  Paul takes the hand of the emperor's daughter as a gesture and retaining of power, but he does explain to her that the marriage is by name only, this wasn't clear in the movie and it just sets up Chani to be mad at him.  Just so that the movie can create this side story.  Paul should have seen this coming after the water of life, but this movie he allows it.  The ending of the movie seems like it sets up to be another movie, as it seems Chanis story isn't done yet.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 2, 2024","Es una obra de arte magistral en todos los aspectos, como te van guiando cada trama y crecimiento de los personajes de principio a fin de la película mostrando muchos aspectos que a mí punto de vista resaltan. La población de los freeman habiendo miles de cientos de personas el haber visto reflejado a su máximo exponente religioso, la primer batalla de Feyd en el coliseo ese ambiente en matices de grises fue espectacular, resaltando la frialdad de mostrar la aniquilación de una raza por completo, las imágenes de los gusanos siendo montados, ver la conexión con los freeman y sobre todo la conexión con la especie! Dándonos un cierre espectacular en batallas individuales, son tantas cosas que pudiera recalcar, vestimentas tipo oriente en los freeman, vestimentas por parte del imperio de la época feudal, sin duda regreso a volver a verla nuevamente a pantalla.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",Well worth it. Only complaint is christopher walken is miscast. He plays the emperor as a weak befuddled man. No one in that atmosphere of treachery would have that kind of personality,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Very long. Acting was ok. Some of the special effects were an eyesore. As a person who has read the book 3 times and watched every adaptation, honestly I prefer the miniseries to this one. Why? Because the extremely bizarre sound effects and color palette made this movie give off a very sinister vibe, whereas the miniseries vibe is more um...exotic and exciting I guess.

The book definitely has the negative strain, but tbh it also has the exciting vibe that isn't really very present here; the tone of this movie veers closer to the second book, djne messiah, which is just so cynical you could vomit.

Um, so yeah. The movie could pass the time. I don't recommend watching in theaters bc the sound effects are super screwed up, but watch it at home if you like. Also check out the miniseries if you want to see a less sinister version.

On a side note i kinda feel like muslim fundamentalists might feel offended at this film.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",An absolute work of art. The acting is powerful from all sides. The sound design communicates every emotion the director intended with perfect timing.

"Mar 2, 2024","So good, really close to the books and epic as it could get.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I'm not going to say much. The first part was better. This movie added different plot twists, but then cut off entire subplots from the book. Visually stunning but too fast paced. Normally a fast paced plot keeps you on edge, but in this case everything was developed so quickly, that you simply moved on to the next plot point. I'm sure their will be plenty of fans especially those that never read the book, but IMHO it was missing something. I would dare say it had no heart. The movie just seemed to go through the motions. Eliminate character A , and give his\her part to character B, check. Add a plot twist, does it make sense, who cares, check.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 2, 2024","Part two is far better than part one. Action sequences and scenes of Paul with fremin gives goosebumps. It is definitely a visual treat and some scenes make you say WOW.

The moments when there was tension gave me chills. Tears formed in my eyes when the credits began to roll because the film was just that good that I stared at the screen in awe.

"Mar 2, 2024",A truly great film! Superb cinematography and excellent acting. See it multiple times and enjoy the world that is Dune!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Astonishing! This movie is a wonderful adaptation with a great form of execution. Despite the various changes, for instance, I am confident that Mr. Herbert would have been proud of the director and all the people involved in this film. Put simply, a masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Saw it today 70mm version. Beautifully shot. Beautifully scored by Zimmer. 
The Casting was great. Particularly Josh Brolin. 
Part one and part two are equallly amazing to me. They both end in a way that clearly leaves the door open for the future.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Excellent we saw it in imax late thurs night (recommend imax) it's beautiful, awe inspiring and even funny. My sons (teens) both loved it as well. Many changes from the book, but understand it was to make it more palatable to people unfamiliar with the book (it can get out there) I personally think this is my fav trilogy of movies (the third will come) A++",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",A complete let down for me after loving part one. I honestly am contemplating not even seeing the third movie because I was so disappointed,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Movie was slow during build up of relationship between Maudee and his girl friend. There was no romance (not meaning a sex scene) so, the personal side of the movie was slow.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Needlessly long, slow drag.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Went into this with too high of expectations. First movie kept closely with the book and this abandoned it immediately. Movies now sacrifice storytelling for visuals and spectacle. This leads to scenes like the one on giedi prime that looks awful and takes away from the point of the scene,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","AMAZING CINEMATOGRAPHY, SOUND AND MUSIC IS A MUST SEE AND HEAR.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",Beautifully shot. Awesome acting. amazing music. and yet I'm bored out of my mind with the confusing convoluted story. I care nothing for anything that's happening. Seems like I'm in the minority tho so good for everyone involved in the movie.,NEUTRAL

"Mar 2, 2024","Incredible follow up to part one, the characters, story and cinematography were incredible.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Absolutely astounding. I don’t think I blinked through the entire film. The scope and scale of a David Lean epic. I never thought I’d see a film adaptation equal to the literary work of Dune, but this has satisfied that desire 100%!",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Wow, wow, wow. What a feat in filmmaking. See it in IMAX if at all possible. An overall fantastic movie all around. I liked the first, but found it a bit slow. Nothing in the 2 hr 45 min movie was slow. Can't wait for Dune Messiah!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Long movie-- but plenty of action.  Spoiler alert-- Cliffhanger -- Dune Part 3 on the Way.  Loved It!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Incredibly powerful story getting to see how Paul's character transforms from beginning to end and how it impacts the plot.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Very good CGI for Dune Part 2. Most of the acting and story carried well. The last part seemed a little slow. It answered some questions from the prior Dune movie. I liked Dune Part 1 more.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This movie is EPIC & mega intense, a long run time? sure but it builds & builds until a climax that will blow you away. it is worth the price of admission.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","So good! Visually STUNNING. A bit slow in the beginning but worth the wait. So magical, cant wait for part 3",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Having read the book as a kid, and re-read as an adult, I was thoroughly enthralled with this cinematic re-telling of such a powerful story. Timothy Chalamet surprises with a gritty and forceful performance. Rebecca Ferguson continues to absolutely shine, and the story is brought round to a satisfying conclusion with the scale of epic drama worthy of the book.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",This was garbage 🗑️ it's basically the first avatar with sand people instead of jungle aliens do not waste your money and time just watch the trailer and that's the hole movie 🍿,NEGATIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",Amazing. Just absolutely amazing. It's one of those movies you HAVE to see on the biggest screen with the best speakers. The sheer sense of power in some of the scenes was unlike anything else I can think of.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This movie was all I hoped part 2 would be. All the world building in the beginning has led to this masterpiece! Acting was excellent, music was masterful, the visuals were amazing! I left the theaters and almost wanted to turn around and buy another ticket to watch it again! I can't wait for part 3! It felt a little slow at the beginning but the build up to the end was worth the slow start!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",I liked how pual surprises me everytime just when I think he might die he does the impossible and when I think I know everything about him he says something or does something I didn't know he would do or think he would every say I seen the movies day 1 after it came out and no spoilers but it had me at the edge of my seat I love how wise and how sincere and willing he is to learn his journey it's like I'm living it in person it's amazing I love Dune 2 and I'm buying the movie on prime or where ever to watch constantly I already watch the first one 13 times and normally I watch movies once or three if I really like it but the number is close to harry potter I watched harry potter like 18 times so 13 is amazing idk if I'm watching it because it's zanaya in it or the story but I'm going with both they are irreplaceable and hope a Dune 3 is able to come out in theaters I hope it doesn't stop at dune 2 I tried the dune books I just couldn't get into it I like the movie version much more anyway I recommend watching definitely worth it I can't wait to see what happens next. I also love how the family is on good terms.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Should I dare say it's better than the first? Two masterpieces with two different tones. I can't wait for the third.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",What are you waiting for? Go see it in IMAX! This movie is a 10/10 in all categories! Soooo well done!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Great movie.  Visionary while visceral.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Better than the first! Story becomes more complex and great visual effects and war scenes.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I was really bored, simply because I didn't like the characters and the dialogue was meh. Great visual effects, but I'm not wowed anymore by vfx. This movie is going to divide audiences. Many will love it, especially the people who roam RT. But general audiences will be bored.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I never read Dune or the others in the series, but these films have certainly motivated me to. The visuals are a given with Denis and the cast is incredibly impressive. This was a blockbuster and it lived up to the hype on the IMAX 70mm screening. Highly recommend for anyone with a sci-fi interest or just into seeing a spectacle.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",It was an experience. Saw it in imax and can't wait to see it again with dbox seats. I felt like I was being caught up in the holy fever. I have some minor gripes with the deviations from the book so I took off half a star.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Loved it! Such a great movie!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This movie defines the word epic. Go see this now, as if your life depends on it.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",Wow doesn't begin to describe this movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Dennis Villanueva delivers an excellent Part 2. Visually compelling, superb acting, solid story.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","The storyline is the only reason I'm not giving it 5 out of 5. I heard words like ""best sci-fi movie I've seen in 20 years."" It was a spectacle that's for sure. Stilgar character was my favorite. I love the ideas of faith and revenge, and love vs. power. Austin Butler nails being a total psychopath. Zendaya was awesome as usual. Some parts of the movie were a bit over my head, so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy the ending. Deadpool and Wolverine have a lot to live up to to even sniff this movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",great cinematogrophy but not true to the book,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Incredible cinematic experience! Loved every minute.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Amazing film. Impeccable acting, directing, cinematography, costuming, music. It has it all. One of the best films of the year! ",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I am not sure why I read reviews.  I loved Madame Web that is sitting at 13% right now and this movie was long and drawn out and not very interesting for 75% of the movie.  The last 20 minutes were okay, but you have to sit through 2 hours and 25 minutes to get to that part.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",A true masterpiece and absolute cinematic experience that will have you on the edge of your seat. An amazing soundtrack and storyline.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",pretty good... looking forward to 3.,POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Complete masterpiece. Denis is the greatest Director currently working, as far I'm concerned.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","One of those films you walk out of the theater and being guilty of recency bias, say it's the best film you think you've ever seen…except this time, it's the truth.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Absolutely amazing movie. From beginning to end really keeps you engaged. Perfect in every way. Beautifully directed and beautifully acted. It builds up to an absolutely fantastic ending  One of the best endings I've ever seen. I've seen it 4 times already and will likely see it a couple more times. GO SEE IT NOW.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Psycodelic yet a clear understanding of the Dune Universe inner workings.  My internal picture of the books did not measure up in any way to this film. It was completely superb.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","An exquisite masterpiece, an admirable and expensive cast, just the kind of film worth its weight in gold",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Excellent movie. Good story, action, and actioning. Nuff said.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Great plot and closely follows the book.  There is a lot more action in this one compared to the first and some of it seemed over done.  All in all though it was very well done and worth seeing!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",An epic masterpiece & a must watch in IMAX. So refreshing to see so many positives from a single movie after maybe Oppenheimer. But no doubt this is bigger in scope & execution in any recent movie which comes to my mind.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Fantastic! Extremely well done.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Greatest sci-fi movie ever made? Um, I don't think so.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",Absolutely stunning continuation from Part One. Wish I could've seen it in IMAX! Must see!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",A great adaptation of the classic Science fiction epic!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","The movie was great!!! Loved the plot and the reunion between Paul and Gurney. However, I didnt like how we need to wait for another couple years for the third movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Too long. Just seemed to jump around. I liked part 1 more.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","Epic Movie!!!!!!!

I was riveted the entire movie........",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Truly PEAK CINEMA, Denis is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This movie was exceptional, with one caveat. Before watching, please read the book. It makes the movie going experience so much better when you can flip to the exact page and find the scene.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Really good and different than the original movie. Closer to the books,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Una excelente pelicula, sus audios increibles de verdad que una tremenda película.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","The movie was visually striking. It set up the suspense in multiple ways, through an amazing narration & acting experience and music/sound track. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This is a once in a decade sci-fi film. A brilliant adaptation and this deserves all of the Oscars as well as other praise this gets. If you're just not into sci-fi or mature story telling then it may not be for you. However, you can still take away the perfect visuals and technical aspects of this film surpassing its predecessor. Wonderful story and exciting and satisfying conclusion to the first book yet leaving it open for the next. 10/10",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Such a 5 star movie in every way. The wait was so worth it. It sure didn't feel like almost 3hrs, I wanted more at the end. The music wasn't as good as the first one, but it was still good. It was such a wonderful escape. This is a must see for any science fiction fan.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I wanted to be obsessed with it but I was not obsessed. Good not great IMO. They changed too many things from the book. You have a science-fiction masterpiece why would you change things? It had amazing cinematography and set design and costumes, and it had some great moments, but it also squandered a bunch of moments that were supposed to be big. Then the ending felt anticlimactic and incomplete, which is especially lame after given that audiences have been waiting since Part One for resolution. It felt like they wanted Zendaya to be a bigger character than she was, and they already stretched how much that character does compared to the book, but they stretched it way too far and it was irritating.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","Really just an incredible cinematic experience. Nothing to really complain about, it's marvelous. Captures the same vibes and lives up to the hype of the MCU films during their peak - eager for the third installment once this makes 500m+ at the box office",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Wow.  Perfect.  Far exceeded my hopes, let alone my expectations.  Truly outstanding as a film and true to the books. Deep in character, plot and human themes of struggle, faith and power.   Very impressive.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I enjoyed Part 1 which I watched twice, but Part 2 just blew me away in a phenomenal way. The cinematography and musical score was perfect and the story, while not a line by line copy of the super dense novel it's based on, it remains true to the spirit of the source material. This is probably the best sci fi ""space opera"" movie I have seen in my lifetime so far. I hope their will be a Dube Part 3 that covers the next 2 books of the Dune series.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",It's good! Very much overhyped but good,NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","Great cinimatogrophy.  Great acting, great characters.  Wonderful vision.  Must be seen on big screen, big d etc.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I'm not sure where to start. This movie offered everything and more that you would expect after the first. The music was phenomenal. The directing was excellent. Acting performances and reflected perfected emotional maturity. The religious zeal portrayed was moving. Perhaps the best movie I have ever seen, legitimately.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","At first this movie stared out slow, much less like the first one, which was action packed from the get go. However, the buildup and suspense was captivating and however skeptical I was this movie blew it out of the water. I didn't think this movie could ever be better than the first one- coming from someone who has read the books, but it was. The ending was filled with action packed scenes that never lost my gaze for a second and I've never been on the edge of my seat before, until this movie. It is a must see and could be considered one of the greatest of all time. A honest 5 star and the theater should have been more packed, injustice to the the directors and film writers who put together this absolute masterpiece of a film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","If there was a word stronger than perfection, it would be the word I use to describe Dune 2. Rebecca Ferguson proves yet again why she's my favorite actress with another dazzling performance! The score, the whole crew, and the cinematography makes this one of the best movies of all time.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Such slow pacing. I'm sure I'm in the minority, but it felt like a lot of filler compared to the first film and really seemed to want to inflate the Timothy hype, which I do not get. Visually it was great, but drug on and could have been tightened up imo.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Absolute masterpiece! It is AMAZING what someone can do when they stick to the source material! Hollywood take note! THIS is how you make a movie!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",I wouldn't have noticed if this movie was 24hrs long. I want a 24hr version. Like what am I to do with my life until I see this again..?,POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",It's a beautifully crafted film. Great balance of action and character development.,POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",Just became my 2nd favorite movie of all time. Right under Lord of the Rings.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Exceptional in every way, and be sure to see it in an IMAX if you want the full effect.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Good action. Parts of the story line were difficult to follow,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Visually satisfying but, despite the length, the script has a few jumps in logic. Story of the messiah being recognized as such by the fremen is predictable. Characters lack depth and it feels like the movie is just trying to go through the motions of the main points in the novel without getting a life of its own. Not a bad movie but not something you'll want to watch again or that gives you any lasting emotions or impressions as soon as you leave the theater.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Amazing!!!! i want to watch it many more times at the cinema,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",fantastic movie very well done. I cannot wait for more.,POSITIVE

Be overwhelmed by the visuals. 
Epic tableaus, emotion turns, exhilarating set pieces : this is Lawrence of Arrakeen. Don't miss this on the biggest screen you can get to.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","An absolute masterpiece that defines what cinemas were built for. The epic of a lifetime that elevates the first film.

"Mar 2, 2024","LISAN AL-GAIB

Okay so that was well worth the wait. I’m not spoiling anything. This movie, like the last one, hits you like a movie from another universe. 
Probably one of the best sci-fi movies to come out in a long time. There’s so much to chew on with this story, I love thinking about it, and I haven’t stopped thinking about it since I left the theater. 

5/5 am going to see it again. 

DREAMS ARE MESSAGES FROM THE DEEP",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Great movie, intense battles, deep religious stuff, and loads of passion. It's basically Game of Thrones and Star Wars at their absolute best. This movie keeps you hooked with its crazy twists and turns, making it a must-watch in the sci-fi world!""",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","This movie is a masterpiece. With its drama, action, and stunning special effects, combined with an outstanding cast, it stands out as exceptional. I cannot wait for the next chapter. This will be the movie of the decade. Villeneuve achieved with Dune 2 what Nolan did with The Dark Knight, both gave us an epic masterpiece. ",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The acting, story, music, and cinematography were beyond anything I can remember.  An absolute power house of a movie.  100% must see in a theater.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I just watched it at the Cinema and it was breathtaking, one of the best movies I've ever seen in theatre. Great acting, great story, great graphics, the music was beautiful, the fighting techniques, everything was on point. There's no part that is out of touch, nothing. I loved the first one and I was hyped for the second ( sometimes being too hyped results in dissapointment), but it was even better, it exceeded my expectations. I think this is Villenueve's best movie ever. I loved the development of the main charachter. I am waiting for the 3-rd which will complete this astonishing triology, I hope it will be as fantastic as DUNE PART 2.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Amazing movie start to finish!! See on the biggest screen possible!!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Villeneuves Dune is a sci-fi epic like Lawrence of Arabia was in another era.   His adaptation of Frank Herberts masterpiece was enthralling in its depiction of the density of the novel.  Cant wait to see it a second time!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This could be the greatest film I've ever seen. I spent the whole 2 hours and 46 on the edge of my seat. It's a movie that submerges you, when you come out of the theatre it almost feels as if your stranger to your own world, everything the lighting, the wardrobe, the sound, the visuals it makes you feel as if your there along the characters, who are also incredibly portrait by an amazing cast.

Btw this opinion comes from a 16 year old who knows nothing about cinematography, and just wanted to say how much she enjoyed the movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",They ruined the spiritual meaning of this movie. They sabotage the romance and turned the hero into a warlord. He was supposed to be a spiritual leader. Too much attention to Harkonnen lives and art. The whole movie was pretty dark. The only think thay saved this movie was the art and the amazing acting Zendaya.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","cinematography was awesome, and the story line was good. It departed from the book a bit  in a good way. I hope they make a part 3. There is much more to cover.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Absolutely brilliant cinematography.  Even better than part one. The writing and directing were magnificent.  The action sequences were very exciting and compelling. The computer graphics were flawless. I will definitely go see this movie again.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","As a fanatical lover of the books, I have been yearning for this film for about 25 years. Not only did it monumentally deliver from a Dune fan's perspective, as a pure cinematic experience, this was unparalleled to anything I have ever had the privilege of seeing on the big screen. A new bar has been set for me as to what I would ever consider to be a cinematic masterpiece. Every aspect of the film was exceptional, from the masterful handling of the complex source material which I already love, to the extraordinary score, to the faultless acting performances across the entire cast, and perhaps the most impressive element of all, the truly spectacular cinematography. This is without a doubt my new favorite film of all time, and I expect may only be rivaled by Messiah, which I have no doubt will be given the go ahead after this. Thank you Denis and the entire Dune team for this astonishing gift... this was filmmaking from another planet!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Epic movie. Loved the book and thought this was a great adaptation. Music was amazing and liked the nods to the 80s version music.,POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Dune: Part Two is another win from director Denis Villeneuve that exceeded my expectation after seeing the first Dune film. Its story, music direction, cinematography, and especially world-building and character development really make this project stand out as a member of the sci-fi genre.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Just a fantastic film with some minor changes with Allya and the ending but Great movie, In the part one Jessica was my least favorite character of the movie by how she as protraded but in this movie she really is a bad ass. I thought it was really well paced the action shots looked amazing and the move just felt right. The Princess in this movie is better rounded out than in the older versions. This really good movie has a lot of storytelling and its well paced not just second thought. Great character development all around, and I highly recommend it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",thoroughly enjoyable even if you didn't read the books you will like this I know people were kind of bummed that the first movie was kind of slow this makes up for it in spades.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Visuals, SFX, acting, and a score that are all, without a doubt, stunning, this film truly is a modern marvel in the realm of cinema. However, unlike in the first film, many more liberties were taken with the source material, with none of the changes succeeding in improving on what was already written in the pages of the original novel. This film is likely to be divisive amongst fans and film-goers alike who crave well crafted artistic movies with passion, but also want to see accurate depictions of their favorite novels on screen. 3.5/5.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","Best Sci Fi action adventure since Empire Strikes Back IMO. About 20 minutes too long and they miscast Christopher Walken as the Emperor. STILL, this is an A+++++++ film , absolutely stunning visuals, unexpected but welcomed comedy, cool action and more. It is very intense, especially in the beginning. There is no Recap, so re-watch part 1 before you go.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",It is essentially a great product of marketing.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This film is made to enjoyed in the theater 🎥 for sure.  Visually stunning and impressive and I don't just mean Timothee' Chalamet. I like how the story is being told. One thing irked me, the overdramatized frown on Zendaya's for almost the entire movie.  Anyway I liked it and I look forward to Part 3.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",EPIC SCI-FI MASTERPIECE OF THE HIGHEST ORDER!,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","It was action pack and it didn't seem like a long movie.   I was angry when it was over, I wanted more.  For those who read the books, a few things changed or left out, but it didn't hurt the story.  I highly recommend seeing this movie.  It is entertainment at its best.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",It was good from the beginning to end. The acting was excellent and believable. It was better than part 1 and is the best movie I've seen since 2019.,POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024",It was everything I hoped it would be and more ,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","the only thing that i was disappointed in was that it over a 9 month period. Where the book its over a 5 to 7 year period. i wont be a spoiler, but the one thing that they left out was at the end where he physically slams his cousin.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Incredible film. A must see in IMAX,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",This movie offered nothing but visuals and aesthetic. None of the character development felt real or understandable. There are straight up characters that play convenient story progression devices but is coated up and given screen time to make us believe they play a role so much more than cameos. Also it took up so many convenient story devices (ahem.. the desert nukes). Absolutely disappointing considering how well the first movie was set up and thought had so much potential.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Didn't  follow the story. Terrible directing.Simply sensationalism.Not good,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Best Sci-Fi movie ever.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","What a refreshing movie.  This was a joy to watch and will watch again.  It was just awesome.  No blatant sex scene for no reason, no stupid DEI.  Just a great movie with a very diverse cast because that is what the movie called for.  It worked, I just hope they keep rolling these out for a while.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Love the VFX, best I've seen in a long time. Admittedly, I'm not familiar with the books, so with that said this movie is very uneven and kind of boring. Aside from Zendaya's formidable presence on screen and the cool overload of the cinematography, I left this movie shrugging my shoulders.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Never been a fan of those types of films. We went to see it to give it another chance. I know I will never goto another one ever again. Not for us.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Epic, visually stunning. Terrific performances by Timothy Chalamet, Javier Bardem, and Austin Butler in particular. Denis and Hans bring their A game. Can't wait for Dune Messiah 😏",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Dune Part Two is.... AMEZING, EPIC, SPECTACULAR, you truly have to see it in the cinema with the big screen and speakers, a real cinematic experience.

Even the parts changed from the book are well made, like Alia, the one thing that shocked me, is a little different from the book, but it can make a big difference for how the third movie will be.

Timothée: is really good, best performance that I showed from him in a while

Zendaya: also an amazing performance, one of her best

Austin: scared me, this is a compliment

Florence: had more screens time that I thought, and she gave Irulan an intensity and an understanding of her character just will little dialogue, thanks to the ameziing performan by Florence that make you know was she thinking just with her eyes.

Rebecca: incredible truly what a performance",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I throughly enjoyed this movie! With that being said, I haven’t read the book so please keep that in mind when reading this review. The actors did a fantastic job and the visual effects were absolutely stunning. The story was intriguing. I liked it a lot more than the first movie. The action kept me on the edge of my seat and it was just such a great experience. I highly recommend Dune Part Two!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","If you like epic battle scenes with plenty of sword play and acrobatic sequences, you'll like this more than I did.  I was looking at my watch towards the end. The visuals were beautifully done, the sound was great and the actors all did a fine job.  I found the 1984 Dune more entertaining, though I understand it wasn't as true to the book.  The  ending was unsatisfying so I guess I'll watch for Dune 3.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","Great cinema experience. Fantastic visuals, amazing sound and performances. Richly detailed costumes, Inventive digital creations. It's long, but doesn't feel it.
I found the story overly complicated but didn't care as it was never dull. I also couldn't clearly hear a lot of the mumbled dialog, but again it never detracted from the journey (as I find a lot of SciFi dialog to be rather clichéd and silly). 
Wonderful action sequences. 
This is a film to see in a cinema or imax if you have one.  It's first class entertainment.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",The movie was amazing and very close to the book! Action throughout the entire movie and kept me at the edge of my seat. Some of the scenes were better than I had imagined them from reading the book. Film is a master piece.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Simply amazing. When I left the theaters, I knew that this one instantly entered my top 15 best movies ever list. It's just amazing, so you should watch it. That's it. Every character is well written, the world is great, and THE ACTION SCENES. The action scenes were some of the best I've ever seen. It's amazing. Period.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Dune Part Two stands as a remarkable cinematic achievement, securing a flawless 10 out of 10 rating. It seamlessly translates the essence of the source material, echoing the intricate narrative of the book while paying a heartfelt homage to the iconic Dune RTS game. The film unfolds with meticulously crafted scenes, each contributing to an immersive sci-fi experience that transcends expectations. From the grandeur of the desert landscapes to the nuanced performances, Dune Part Two solidifies its place as a masterful continuation, captivating audiences with its artful storytelling and visual brilliance.",POSITIVE

"Mar 2, 2024","Just brilliant. No other words. Best film I've seen since Dune Part 1. The score is amazing. Echoes of Dune 1. But continue on to tie the films together. And there's no romantic notion of Paul, by the end of the film he's accepted his fate and embraced it knowing the consequences. Hoping for Dune Messiah soon 🤞🏼",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Magnificent! Superb! Well Done! I was captivated every second throughout the entire movie. Ibwas on an adrenaline high for 4 hours after the movie. Highly recommend, even if you haven't seen part one.  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Great conclusion to what was set-up in Part 1. If you enjoyed the Part 1 you will enjoy Part 2.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I loved the Dune books and reread them multiple times.  They are epic.

Even though there is WAY too much content to put into a movie I found the first installation really engaging and told enough of the story well enough to leave me excited for Dune 2.  Knowing the story helped but I didn't find myself lost by the movie.  Watched it again at home last week and my adult son was hooked within the first 20 minutes.  He has never read the books or seen other Dune movies.

Dune 2 was 1 hour of content spread over 3 tedious hours.  I appreciated the aesthetic but the palette and intensity that seemed to add to the first movie, only served to make the second an unrelentingly exhausting, tedious, disappointing experience.    I wasn't engaged in the characters or the story I just wanted it to end.

Perhaps if I'd splurged on the worm popcorn bucket …",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","This is a good movie, but I hate to put that in there. I like the ending in the original movie I guess I'm just prejudiced.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024","An absolutely PERFECT movie for a follow up. Nothing Hollywood has produced can compare to this epic Sci-Fi film. Very Happy to welcome the Dune-Universe to fellow nerds, Not a multiverse. 
I wonder what YT channel The First The Last The Nerdom will say about it. +F+L+N",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Just blown away. Impossible to adapt source material done justice. Liberties taken with the book I felt justified by the medium, but didn't take away from the core story. Sure, I wish someone could make a 10 hour movie to give us everything (Thufir, Weirding Modules, etcetera) but being a sane person who can get over myself for long enough to not let perfect be the enemy of good, just so happy with this movie.

If I had a singular gripe, I felt the ending trying too hard to segue into the greenlit ""Messiah"" was clunky. The book ends open enough, but didn't beg for a sequel. I like the sequels, but fear that they start only getting harder to adapt . So ending part 2 as it did has me worried that failure to stick the landing with Messiah will force the two wonderful movies we have now to be considered in the future only as part of a trilogy that should have stopped at 2, and that would be a shame. I'd love to be proven wrong though, and Villenueve has really impressed me this far.

Bravo.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","such an incredible story, and so well done! Will go watch it again",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Had some interesting twists, but followed the original narrative quite well. Visually stunning and the use of loud bursts adds to to thrill that was the DUNE II production. Great movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","What can I say that everyone else hasn't? It was amazing and I loved it, for sure! It was long but even with the mid-movie pee break it felt like the perfect length for the amount of story condensed into the film, it didn't feel rushed or dragged out which was my biggest fear. The scope of the film was epic and awe inspiring. It makes me both anticipate and fear Messiah, but I'll definitely see it good or bad.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",Best movie I’ve seen a long time. Couldn’t have done a better adaptation,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","The Star Wars or Lord of the Rings of today! Spectacular narrative, acting, and Hans Zimmer's score brings it all together. Who knew a film could look even more stunning than Dune Part 1! IMAX is essential! The MUST SEE of our time...",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","An epic movie , visualy stunning, amazing story, not rushed and never boring 10/10!",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","There is absolutely NO negative review a critic could give to Dune 2 that would not be a testament to their self-importance. If they say they didn't like this movie, they were only thinking about what they could achieve for themselves by doing so; namely, a reputation for rebelliousness.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","I knew I was going to enjoy this film, but I did not expect to come away from it feeling it was one of the best sci fi films ever made. Dune Part Two is a phenomenal piece of cinematic art. Pure movie magic. A perfect marriage of source material, artistic vision and the big budget to realise it. This is what happens when producers and executives get the hell out of the way and let true filmmakers do their work. Dune Part Two is epic, haunting, emotional, devastating, exciting, dense, bizarre, philosophical and artistic. This will become a timeless classic - and if they manage to make Dune Part Three, it will become a benchmark cinematic trilogy that will be studied and talked about for years to come. It's the first movie in 20 years that I wanted to walk out and buy another ticket straight away. It's everything I hoped it would be, and more. I can't believe it was almost 3 hours long and I wanted it to keep going. Bravo, Denis and Co. Bring on Part Three.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Absolutely loved it. Excellent action and acting. An awe-inspiring culmination of everything that was set up in Part 1.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Seamlessly picks up where Dune left off.  Like it's predecessor, this sequel is cinematically beautiful, with a nice balance of expository plotlines and well choreographed fight and battle scenes. Chalamet and Zendaya have true a chemistry and connection which carries us emotionally across the sands and fortifies our faith in the good guys. Of course, the tale ends without the closure we yearn for, but since we have been promised a Part 3 from director Villenueve (and Warner Bros) it will surely be met with as much anticipation as was the last installment of the Star Wars trilogy. These Dune films are as fine an adaptation as they come. Bravo!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Definitely the Best movie in several years by a long shot.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Solid. Worth it in IMAX,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I have rated some sequels in my time as awesome, The Empire strikes back. Terminator 2, this is as good if not better! This is now a Top 5 film for me of all times visually it is disgustingly good I felt like I don't ever want to forget what I witnessed, if you don't watch this in IMAX, you are missing out. I will be watching this again more than once, films like this don't come around often! Watch it and thank me later (oh if you aren't a Dune fan or haven't watched the first one) I highly recommend you catch up, that or don't bother, haters will always hate regardless!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","The scope of this film is immeasurable. The establishing shots, the cinematography, the visuals, the world building, the sound design and the score are all astounding. What holds this movie back is its pacing and inability to hold the weight of its own story.",NEUTRAL

There weirding way of fighting was never mentioned. His drinking of the water of life was done outside in the desert and he was saluted by the worms. The fight sequence at the end was wrong also it was hi sister who killed the baron. I loved the part where in the book he said to the benageserit mother  that the dark place you are afraid to look there you will find me,at Fayds death he cracks him in half along with the floor and looks to the sky and makes start raining. That is when they all see he is the Kwisatz Haderach.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 1, 2024","This movie lives up to the hype, a great movie on an epic scale that is executed brilliantly. Great Cinematography was on full display, which is expected with Dennis Villeneuve. Dune 2 pushes the limits with stunning shots and well thought out action scenes. You can truly feel the stakes throughout the movie, the cast shines from almost every scene. The standouts being Chalamet & Austin Butler, Butler making an outstanding antagonist. I can tell that there is some Heath Ledger inspiration behind his performance. This movie is truly a spectacle that I recommend everyone who enjoys cinema to see on there nearest IMAX screen!",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","While this second part veers from the book in some crucial ways, the character-focus of the story and the believability of the actors is unmatched. Denis Villenueve does some of his best directing and includes shots that take your breath away and leave you on the edge of your seat. Austin Butler stole the show, but everyone, down to the most minor characters, nailed their roles. Highly recommend seeing this second installment on the big screen.",POSITIVE

Complex, gravitas story with more meaning than good vs. evil. Beautiful cinematography, but requires a long attention span to get a great payoff.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I was not particularly enamored with part one of Dune because I felt it was bland and did not have much purpose to itself.... and then I saw this.  Unquestionably the superior of the two parts as it instantly makes part one better.  The characters and their motives are better understood, the conflicts are greater and more pronounced, and the plot is more clear.  After Dune: Part One, I had little interest going into Dune: Part Two; after Dune: Part Two, there needs to be a part three.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Better than part 1, which is not too common. Thrilling action scenes, great story line. It's been long since I saw such a great movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Captures Dune Saga well. Far too loud though.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Perfect conclusion to Part 1. Especially liked the sandworm riding scenes. Followed the book in most places except the character Alia. But it seemed more streamlined and fast. In the book, years have passed but in the movie Jessica is still pregnant. Acceptable from a storytelling point of view. The emphasis on the Bene Gesserit is noticeable and pretty cool, especially the conversation between Irulan and Mohiam about the fall of House Atreides.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","What a film. This is almost as good as we could have possibly hoped for. As a fan of the books, this is the film I've waited decades for. 

There were a few changes from the book, but overall it was spectacular. If you love science-fiction, go see this film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","The best cinematic experience I've ever had. Dune: Part 2 is beyond visually stunning - it's a work of art. The cinematography is supercharged by masterful acting, notably from Timothee Chalamet. He truly gave a performance of a lifetime (Best Actor incoming!). His scenes with the Fremen, especially in the second half of the film, are breathtakingly intense. 

Paul's evolving relationship with the Fremen and vice versa is incredible to witness on the screen. When I read the book, it was hard to wrap my mind around how the Fremen actually behaved around Paul as he became their Messiah. In Dune: Part Two, their religious fervor and devotion is on full, beautiful display. A major step up from the book in this regard.

The plot went a little too fast for my liking, but I understand the need to condense the second part of the novel into one movie. Regardless, Dune: Part 2 is a masterpiece that will go down in sci-fi and general cinematic history as one of the greats.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","this is where cinema is made for! gorgeous worldbuilding, amazing story, perfect pacing and otherworldly acting. If star wars is a sci fi adventure fantasy movie dune is the adult politic, war, beliefs, romance cfi fi movie. A must see.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","If you’re not familiar with the story it gives Matrix, Star Wars, and Avatar.  If you see it do it in IMAX.  The movie is almost 3 hours long i still left wanting more.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Absolutely phenomenal. Book readers will be pleased as pt 2 concludes the first book tastefully despite some deviations from the original source material. The month of March just started and this will clearly be one of the best films of the year.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",The film was amazing Paul atreides did a exactly acting loved zendaya performance in the film and other characters in the films love the scene where zendaya helping Paul atreides and other characters in the flim helping out Paul atreides on journey of him becoming a fate of life in his choice the villain  Australia butler who played feyd-Rautha did a amazing job love the scene where we see him fighting in the battle and love the scene where he fights Paul atreides to see who wether king to live or fate,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","A masterpiece. Nearly flawless. The performances, cinematography, special effects, score…amazing. Will probably sweep 2024 Oscar’s. See it on the biggest screen possible and strap in!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Amazing movie - incredible cinematography, great script, powerful sound. Worthy of multiple trips to the theater.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Really epic! Unfortunately I went in without seeing the first. It was my first time experiencing a movie like that, so I would advise people to see the first movie for all the context.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",It's as good as everyone says.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Epic! This is a cinema experience movie  and to get the full impact you have to watch this movie on the biggest of screens.  The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer again very much adds to the experience and helps immerse you into these wonderful worlds.  A grown ups sci fi movie that definitely packs a punch and comes with added spice.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Just watched Dune 2 in Bremen/Germany in the original English version. What are you waiting for ... go and watch it!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",I wouldn't watch it again. If I didn't know what it was about this movie would not really have explained it to me. I'm guessing to the average older viewer that Paul (Timothy) seemed like the leader of the cult in Guyana(sp).,NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Una película épica y grandiosa,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Greatest Sci-Fi Movie i've ever seen. Masterpiece,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Dune 2 is a superior movie to Dune 1 which was once a wonderful movie, that's what a Sci-Fi fan expects from a book adaptation, in addition to the perfect soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. Very well constructed movie with passing the right emotion in the action and CGI scenes!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",amazing continuation of an already amazing movie,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Incredible from start to finish. I love Denis adaption and although he changed a few important aspects he really did Dune and the Dune fans proud. The stellar cast shone through all standing out in their own way and doing their characters justice. Hans Zimmers score was quite literally other worldly & of course thank you to everyone else who worked on making the movie what it was. I am so glad that I got to see this movie in the cinema on the big screen and I am already excitedly anticipating Dune Messiah.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","As long as you did not love the book, you'll probably enjoy it. As a book purist, I am extremely disappointed in the choices Villanueve made.  He changed major aspects of several storylines that left me feeling I watched a similar concept to the book that took place in the same universe, but was ultimately not about the book characters I love. Aside from the massive recharacterization of several main players, the pacing was also off, with odd jumps and lulls and side stories that didn't expand the narrative for me. I absolutely loved Dune Part One, but Part Two was such a let down.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2024",Worms good! Go see the worms!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Great part 2 and continuation of the first movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Dune 2 was terrible. It is mystifying to me why the basic plot should be warped and completely inverted. The book has sold millions and millions of copies and the 2nd movies bares only a passing resemblance to Herbert's classic. It's like some Hollywood director is like ""I'm going to remake Romeo and Juliet, but totally change how it turns out"". Ridiculous.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",After extensive research im convinced someone is paying for good reviews! The movies i love score 30% 70% and boring movies like dune score 94%. Theres no one someone watch that and thought this is incredible!. If so i truly don't understand the humans in this world! This movie sucks! Ive fallen asleep 3 times trying to watch it. Only movie to put me to sleep more was gravity. The first dune was okay. This one is boring! Get excited with 1hr left for.. more sand and 2 secs of josh brolin.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",There has to be a part 3,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",I seen the movie last night and it and stellar is an understatement. It's been a long time that I seen a movie where I was so focused on the story and the visuals. If Frank Herbert was alive I think he would be proud that a movie based off his book came to life the way it did.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Amazing.  I'm still processing.  I've been a massive Dune fan for a very long time.  This is one of the best novel adaptations I've ever seen. I really wish Villeneuve would do at least the first four books.  I know he's thinking about Dune Messiah, but God Emperor of Dune would be phenomenal in his hands.  I'm ready to go back and watch it again tonight.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","This movie and its cast is destined to be all-timers.
Denis Villeneuve brings the beloved sci-fi novel to the big screen as truthfully as he should. Went to see it with the highest of expectations and still it exceeded it. ,,Long live the fighters""",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",VillenEWve. knocked it ouf the park. yes.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",I read most of the Dune books as a young man.  I liked the way the movie followed the outline of the story.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I had a great time at the movie theater, the cast, the scenery and the music is fanastic",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",An epic in every sense of the word.  The vlending of stunning visuals and music bring a poetic undertone to the conflict at hand.  The performances are uniformly excellent.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","This is a rare movie in which the build up from the first movie truly pays off. There were so many instances in this film where I thought would be the cliffhanger ending. Not only did the story keep going, but it kept getting better and better. By the end, I found that my jaw had dropped and I had to willfully tell myself to close it as I couldn't believe what I was watching. Modern cinema at its finest.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Amazing film, lived up to what I remember from the book from decades ago, another gorgeous film and couldnt believe its been 3 years since the last and now have to wait for messiah to come out ugh.

I cannot say anything else. What a second part. Frank herbert must be smiling right now.

Villeneuve, I LOVE YOU.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Outstanding in IMAX. I loved the great scenes. Timothée Chalamet was outstanding. He’s a great actor. I highly recommend watching this movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",This film was adapted well from the novel. The changes the director made were a little annoying if you wanted it to follow the novel but the story was still til well.  The only issue that was really absurd was the fact the entire timeline takes place in less than nine months.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Love this movie from beginning to end definitely we go watch again to relive it once more.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",breathtaking display of 21st century cinema.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","A somehow even larger, more epic portrayal than Part One. Deep intrigue and scheming from the book is given a AAA movie scale and it works. The story is slightly altered to make it better for audiences than if told word-for-word. 

We are witnessing the 2020's equivalent of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings rendition and we should not take that for granted.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Best movie I've ever seen.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",The most amazing Sci Fi experience I’ve ever witnessed,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","This has felt like a long awaited sequel since the 2021 release of ""Dune: Part One"", Denis Villeneuve & the talented cast & crew behind the scenes have delivered another visually thrilling entry to this universe. 
""Dune: Part Two"" visually stunning, thunderous sound design in this massive & impressive sequel that feels alive from all the world building of it's predecessor, yet it manages to build upon it without being overbearing by giving greater sense of beliefs, brutality & power of the Great Houses.
Most importantly it dives deeper into The Fremen culture & the main themes of blind faith towards religion & the power & corruption when your hand is forced into a holy war.
Rebecca Ferguson, great as always. Zendaya & Timothée Chalamet both grown with their characters, especially Chalamet as Paul Atreides, who reluctantly faces his prophecy. Austin Butler is uncomfortable viewing with that convincing deranged look of gratification across his face. ",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",If you liked the first part you should like this one. There is a little more world building.  A solid movie that seems poised to lead into the next book in the series.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2024","Amazing visuals,sounds, and acting! A few changes from the book but they are executed beautifully. Definitely a movie to see on imax. Probably gonna see it again",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",Atendeu minhas expectativas. Fotografia e som maravilhosos! Adaptação respeitosa com a obra literária. Não fiquei cansada e fiquei com vontade de rever o filme no cinema novamente.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Dune was epic and amazing to see, both visually and in terms of story. What an adventure ! The characters are all deep and layered. I can only acclaim the performances of Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Souhelia Yacoub, Austin Butler, Rebecca Fergusson and Florence Pugh. They were all amazing. Left me with chills and a desperate need to see it again.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","So excited the second lived up to the hype of the first. Hoping that with the success here we will get another film from the storyline. Cast was impressive much like before. I love Zendaya, but I feel her performance wasn't as good this go around. Definitely worth it to see it in imax. I loved the feeling the sound.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","Captivating but experienced moviegoers may experience downgraded immersion

Pros: Brilliant visuals/sound effects, wonderful acting, immersive and exciting battle scenes. 

Cons: Many pieces of exposition felt haphazard and repetitive, and certain casting choices(esp.Christopher Walken) brought me back down to Earth—in a bad way. The score was often tacky, the sound was gradually cranked up to 11 for the epic ending to the point of physical pain. Some of these things could simply by symptomatic of being familiar with the book/directing tools",NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2024","An absolutely epic experience on a monumental scale. Could not have been happier.
Surprisingly, I mostly enjoyed the changes made from the source material.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","It was magnificent. It picked up exactly where Dune left off. The scope and breadth of the film is outstanding and if Frank Herbert was alive today, he would hail it as good a depiction of his seminal novel that could be put on the screen. The only letdown was the way it ended with Chani, which diverged from the book in a significant way. We'll have to see what happens in Dune:Messiah when Denis decides to make it. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya and Javier Bardem gave Oscar worthy performances. Rebecca Ferguson did a good job as Lady Jessica. Stellan Skarsgard, Dave Bautista and Austin Butler ARE Baron Harkonnen, Rabban and Feyd Rautha. I'm going to have to see it again and give a more in-depth review.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Absolute must see for Sci Fi fans, my goodness!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Best movie I've ever seen in my 36 years of life. Long live DV! Keep making the greatest cinema in history. Can't wait for part 3! Bless the maker and his water!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I was nervous, but Dune Part Two delivers on so many levels. From the visuals, to the sound to the storyline. All strong performances from the actors involved. What a work of art this film was. Especially if you get to see it in IMAX. 9/10 for me.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","thoroughly enjoyed this movie, the fights scenes are great and the scope of the movie is huge!! If you enjoyed Part 1 you'll enjoy this sequel",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Denis Villeneuve has truly outdone himself with Dune Part 2. Everything from the Visuals, the Cinematography, to the Score is absolutely breathtaking. The performances from Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, etc are all amazing. If you want to see a Masterpiece in filmmaking then this is your movie. I absolutely loved it 5/5",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","As anticipated, a thrilling watch!

I enjoyed 'Dune', though remember thinking it was obviously a complete set-up to a sequel and that this would only improve upon its predecessor - and that's very much the case. 'Dune: Part Two' is excellent! My interest did wane slightly at roughly the middle part, as was similarly the case with the first film in truth, but that was a feeling that only lasted for a relativiely short time.

All in all, it's fantastic. The acting is top notch, the visuals are breathtaking (those sandworms tho) and the score is outstandingly hefty - you can always rely on the great Hans Zimmer! Timothée Chalamet stars yet again, as do the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Dave Bautista & Co. The person I actually enjoyed most on screen was Javier Bardem, who is truly brilliant throughout.

Bring on 'Dune Messiah'! On that note, happy to read that director Denis Villeneuve has noted that he won't be rushing that one out - and rightly so!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",great movie - will see it again.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",I had high expectations for this film and Villeneuve delivered a visually stunning film with strong storytelling with A listers delivering top performances. I will be seeing this film multiple times.,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","Simply put, this has the chance to overtake LOTR as the GOAT Trilogy imho. The movie is beautiful. From the actors, to the production to the music, everything is top tier. This might go down as the greatest sequel/movie ever created. Watching it again tonight!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","One of the greatest sci-fi movies that I have seen since Interstellar. The scenes are beautifully filmed, acting is excellent, visual effects are elite.  All in all, just a great film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",This movie was visually stunning. Hans Zimmer score only builds on the breathtaking sound of his previous score for Part One. This film is a sci-fi masterpiece and should be praised!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Dune: Part Two is effortlessly one of the best films I've ever seen, and I'm so glad I could experience this masterpiece in a fully sold-out IMAX theater with many other Dune fans. Let's start this by talking about the absolutely incredible acting we got from everyone in this film - Chalamet, Zendaya, Butler, Ferguson, Walken, Pugh, Brolin, Bardem, all of them... fantastic. It's only two months into the year, but I can already see Chalamet getting a nomination for Best Actor at next year's Academy Awards. Equally as outstanding as the cast, the visual effects and cinematography were simply out of this world. Every single damn shot looks like it was chiseled by hand and polished to perfection. You could take so many shots from this film and put them in the best art gallery in the world, and they wouldn't look out of place. And as if that wasn't enough, the soundtrack by the legendary Hans Zimmer is exceptionally exquisite, adding to the story so well that it felt as if the music was a character itself. The action sequences were flawless and breathtaking, never failing to give me full-body chills and leaving my jaw on the ground. I'm still dumbfounded by how perfect this film was, and you can bet that I'll be back in theaters many more times to see this masterpiece of filmmaking.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",dune part 2 was awesome and amazing movie better than dune part 1 I will see it again when comes on startup show,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Great movie. I liked the pacing and the development of the story. The action parts were epic. Well filmed and acted. The score is moving and supporting as well. All around an excellent film and as true to the book as a good movie could be.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Part 2 picks up right where Part 1 ended, and the it's wild and emotional ride.  I got done the movie and wanted more, it was so emotionally draining as you watch the journey of Paul Atreides and his steps towards ultimate power and the approaching Holy War.  The writing and cinematography are mind blowing!  Denis Villeneuve is truly one of the greatest directors, his scripts and the visuals in the movie are stunning.  The plot alone is so deep, that you get done and need to watch it again to pick up all the nuances of the story.  It's a beautiful sight in contrast to the throw-away writing and CGI-heavy Marvel/Disney movies these days.   This is a must-see for all the Dune fans, and anyone who is a movie-goer.  Truly a spectacle to see on the big Theater screen!!!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I have not written a review in quite some time, but for this EPIC of a film, I highly recommend going to the theaters this weekend to see Dune: Part 2 – specifically in IMAX or IMAX 70mm if you're able to. From the cinematography, to the character arcs, to the stellar acting, to the captivating landscapes of Budapest, Italy, Jordan and Abu Dhabi, this movie is a visual/audio masterpiece. You are fully immersed into the the Dune dimension from the first 15 minutes of the film, prepare yourself for a Sci-Fi thrill ride like no other this year! 10/10",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",This movie is perfect. 5/5 and still not enough for what it deserves.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","This film is a cinematic masterpiece, an immersive experience. For those who are fans of the original novel, this film is like a continuation of the imagination of a cruel world they already know, opening up new aspects that they have never experienced before. For those watching the film for the first time, this can be one of the most captivating cinematic experiences imaginable. Every frame is a masterpiece, alongside a captivating storyline.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","If you like sand, you're going to love this. I knew this film was going to be more complex from the first part as I have read the book and I think Villeneuve handled this with panache. The story moved at a steady tempo and never felt bogged down or muddled. Zimmer, again effortlessly delivers an epic score. As I walked home from the cinema the only word I could think to describe this film was biblical. I know I differed in my admiration for the movie as a small party sat next to me kept having to confer with each other and admitted to me after they got lost in the middle and one gave up trying to understand, so be warned.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Visually stunning but far too many liberties taken with the original story.  Zendaya's limitations as an actress are on full display.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Exceeded expectations and more. The character development of Paul and Jessica is immense and the fight scenes cranked up a notch from the last film. My only criticism is that I didn't get to hear ‘the voice' in action enough!,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",Defining film of the decade!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Closest thing to perfection I have ever had the pleasure of seeing in this genre. A childhood dream realised on screen.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Great visuals but was a bit disappointed with how much of the story was changed for part 2. It really changed the meaning and take aways from the original relationships and makes the next 5 stories sort of awkward (not that they plan to actually make those). The holy grail has been to make a faithful adaptation of Dune.  After part one, there was belief that Denis Villeneuve might be the one to deliver… but unfortunately the holy grail still has not realized. It is a decent movie, not as good as the first part and changed to appease a modern sensibilities rather focused than sharing the book’s wisdom.  I think the ending fell flat as an empire divided. Arguably more ‘realistic’ but not as inspiring or enjoyable.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2024","It's better than first movie but that's not really saying much lol.  The problem with this director is just too many long, drawn out scenes which are in need of major editing and he also need a new lighting guy because some scenes are so dark that you don't see anything.  Best scene is main character doing his first worm ride but I saw that alredy in sneak peak after first movie reissue show.  Final knife fight was nothing special when you have movies like John Wick that are far more inventive and fresh in the action genre",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Watching Dune part 2 make me believe that this movie was actually shot on another planet it was spectacular. I enjoyed it at the nearest AMC theater in Dolby,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","In the pantheon of science fiction cinema, ""Dune: Part Two"" stands as a colossus, redefining the genre's boundaries with its blend of epic storytelling and profound thematic depth. Director Denis Villeneuve crafts a sequel that not only surpasses its predecessor but also cements itself as a landmark in cinematic history.

Greig Fraser's cinematography is a triumph, transforming the alien landscapes of Arrakis into breathtaking vistas that are as emotionally compelling as they are visually stunning. Each frame is a meticulously composed work of art, contributing to an immersive experience that is rarely achieved in film.

Hans Zimmer's score transcends the traditional role of film music, becoming an integral character in its own right. His compositions elevate the narrative, adding layers of emotional resonance that enhance the viewing experience in an indelibly profound way.

The ensemble cast delivers performances of staggering depth and complexity. Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides is a masterclass in nuanced acting, capturing the internal struggle of a young man burdened with unprecedented destiny. Zendaya, alongside Chalamet, adds a riveting dimension to the saga, her character's development enriching the film's emotional landscape.

The meticulous attention to detail in production design and costume brings Frank Herbert's rich universe to life with an authenticity and grandeur that is unmatched. Villeneuve's vision for ""Dune: Part Two"" is realized with such precision and care that it transcends the confines of its source material, becoming a singular cinematic experience.

""Dune: Part Two"" is not merely a film; it is a monumental achievement that challenges and captivates. It stands as a testament to the power of cinema to transport, to transform, and to transcend. A masterful blend of spectacle and substance, this film is a must-see for cinephiles and casual viewers alike, deserving of its place among the finest works of science fiction and beyond.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Is it a heady science fiction film with a lot of deep thoughts to chew on? Yes. It's also a massively gorgeous piece of cinema with spectacular action scenes, horrifying villains, and great acting performances, music, and writing. Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides and Zendaya as Chani have the chemistry of one of those couples who make you go, ""Aw, look at those two,"" but their relationship soon becomes very complicated and weird. Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha is a compelling psychopathic monster who may scare you in a good way. Denis Villenueve's directing is absolutely brilliant on many levels. He gets the meaning of the story so well that watching this movie feels like the way I felt when I first read the book. Frank Herbert's Dune was a real page-turner that got me caught up in its messianic spell and this movie has that same spicy flavor. I highly recommend this movie. Go see it in an IMAX theater so you can get why IMAX is a great format for cinema.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Absolutely incredible,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Love it. Really engaging,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Denis Villeneuve delivers with a masterpiece, a flawless film. It'll lauded by the film enthusiasts for ages. I recommend watching it only on the big screen.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I have read the books, and therefore, my judgement may be influenced by a cognitive bias. This second part covers the latter half of Herbert's first book, and I regard it as one of the finest cinematic adaptations ever made. The essence of the novel's plot is faithfully preserved, without being significantly distorted.
I would divide the film into two parts: an initially rather slow beginning, and a final part that suddenly becomes too fast-paced and cursory, leaving gaps in the storyline. The film could have easily been split into two separate instalments, allowing more time to be devoted to the development of the second half. As it stands, it leaves us hoping for a future director's cut that might expand the film further.
What else is there to say? Visually, it's an absolute feast for the eyes. The cinematography is exceptional, and the soundtrack is extraordinary, showcasing a particularly inspired Hans Zimmer. The ending suggests a potential third part. In the meantime, 'May Thy Knife Chip & Shatter.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Beautiful movie.  The score and cinematography is amazing.  The acting is terrific, especially Austin Butler! I was blown away.  I will definitely see it again in IMAX.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Hands down the best sci-fi film I’ve ever seen. And I’ve seen a lot.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Overall as a film it was pretty good. As an adaptation of Dune it went so above and beyond in its ambition that I think it lost the essence of the book several times. Continuity of the plot was a bit choppy, some scenes (which were placed out of order from the events of the book) seemed there only to drive the immediate next point of the narrative in the film, which felt clumsy. Visually stunning, and absolutely worth seeing in Dolby Atmos because the audio was mind-blowing. But under close examination, some of the luster falls off. As a fan of the books, I wonder what the greater vision for this film series is because while Part 1 was faithful, at this point it has diverged a lot from the source material, mostly in terms of pacing and some characterization.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2024",Absolutely stunning - this is a classic. Wanting more already.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Wow. An actual epic worthy of the cinema screen!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",A masterpiece! Maybe the best sci-Fi movie ever made!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Frist i admit was story building. The second one really pays off. We saw the movie at AMC Dolby digital and with the added effects really takes you into the movie. I thought all the acting was great. If you like Sci Fi at all, please do yourself a favor and go see this movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Histórico , melhor ficção no cinema ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",The best IMAX experience I have ever had by far. It looked gorgeous and they did a fantastic job of adapting such iconic source material - something previously thought to be impossible. Dune Messiah absolutely deserves to be adapted next!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",An absolute Sci Fi masterpiece. The movie is an excellent short form adaptation of the novel. I agree with others that to truly do Dune to the standard of the book would require 12-15 hours. But this is an excellent movie well worth the watch.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I've read the book 3 times over the last 20 years. The two Villeneuve movies combined, with Dune Part 2 being the stronger chapter, tell the story of Dune even better than Frank Herbert's book was able to. Yes, better than the book.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I was in awe at what they were able to bring to the big screen. The cinematography, the acting, the music, the sound, everything was an immersive masterclass in Sci Fi film making. As a lover of the book, there are some changes and streamlining of the narrative that left me wanting more, but I think they made sense for enhancing the film. Cant wait to see it again!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",This movie is equal to The Return Of The King.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Well done, fun to watch, wonderful soundtrack.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Dune: Part Two absolutely lives up to the hype. One of the most visually stunning and emotionally thrilling movies I've experienced in a theater. See this on the biggest screen you can but a theater with a great audio system I would say is an even higher priority. Building on his work in Part 1, Hans Zimmer delivers perhaps the best score of his already legendary career. Every performance was great but Chalemet as Paul and Austin Butler as Feyd Rautha are the two that are going to stick in my mind permanently.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",One of the best movies ive ever seen.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Exceeded all expectations.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Breathtaking. Phenomenal. Generational type movie. This movie will resonate with me for the rest of my life. Yes it's that good.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","An absolute masterpiece in filmmaking! One of, if not then greatest movies of all time. This will be spoken about for generations to come and rightly so.
If you haven't seen this yet, it is a must watch.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",One of the all time great sci fi films,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",It's good. Almost a 3 hour movie but kept my interest. I wish some of the battle sequences were longer but a solid movie. I didn't see it in IMAX but I will go see it again.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",It was so great that made me create a rotten tomato account to rate it 5 stars.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",I could have watched a six hour cut of this movie. Nothing has made me feel the way this movie has in a long long while.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Overall really good. Loved the futuristic elements and most of the cast did a fantastic job. I was never a huge Austin Butler fan until now...I thought he was incredible as Fayd-Rautha. The only reason that I did not give a full 5 star was Zendaya. She made no effort to tailor her role to fit the rest of the Freman. It sounded like they plucked a Cali girl off the streets of LA and dropped her into the movie. Her character was annoying as well..I don't know if that was bad writing or just bad acting (although the rest of the cast was amazing so i'm assuming that the latter is responsible). If she was a minor character, it wouldn't have been a big deal but unfortunately you will have to endure her for the majority of the movie. Aside from that, this movie was great",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Went to Regal RPX with Dolby Atmos this movie deserves to be seen in theaters. Fan of the 1984 version and part 1, but this movie is epic in every sense of the word and I was blown away by it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I never went to masterpiece movies as this one was, I was like 🤯, it was a phenomenal/legendary movie, Timothee Chalamet was a pure genius, as well as Zendaya, Rebeca Ferguson, Florence Pugh, Austin Butler as Feydh Rautha, master of villainy, the rest of the cast where from another world as well, definetly recommending this movie as a Spring Season start for this weekend, you won't be sorry.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Butchers the book, but after divorcing myself from that point, I had a decent time. It's a little jarring how scene changes happen. I thought I was having a seizure when they popped from one point to the next without even a fade.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2024","I have read the Books within the last year or so and so really really enjoyed the film and was able to follow it easier and know where the plot was heading. Not sure how easy it would have been to follow the plot / if it would be confusing, if not read them….That was my experience with the first film, which I still loved, hence I read the books to better understand the saga and also watched it several times over! This was a 5 ⭐️ film for me and on par with he first if not even more impressive",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",This film is a fantastic example of what great filmmakers and great stories can create. Long live the fighters!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Just caught Dune Part 2, and I gotta say, the hype is real. Walking out of the cinema, I'm itching to know what happens next. Shoutout to Denis for promising Dune Messiah adaptation. 👍🏽 Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Florence Pugh, and Austin Butler killed it in this epic movie. Timothee, Hollywood's savior, really won me over as Paul. Part 2 dives deep into Paul's struggles after losing his father and embracing the Fremen life. The ending, spot on – reminiscent of a certain anime character (no spoilers). Admittedly, some parts were tricky to grasp, but that's Dune – complex yet rewarding. Clocking in at 2 hours and 50 minutes, catch it in the biggest cinema for the full impact of the story, killer score, and mind-blowing cinematography. 10/10. #ctto 📸 Warner Bros. Pictures #Dunemovie #dunepart2",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",It was a phenomenal movie! Definitely worth the watch!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",one of the best movies of all time.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I can't imagine it being possible to adapt the Frank Herbert's 1965 novel into film any better than Denis Villeneuve has done. A monumental achievement in science fiction and the best blockbuster movie of the last decade. Movies like this should be a wake-up call to Hollywood, encouraging the industry to take more risk and let the creative geniuses like Denis chase their vision without compromise. I'll be going back to the theatre to watch Dune: Part 2 again asap.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Whilst being visually stunning it differs so drastically from the books that it becomes a generic sci-fi movie and loses all the flavour of the the book.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2024","While it deviates more from the book than Dune: Part 1, the deviations make sense for the film and lay a solid path for a Dune: Part 3, which would come from unresolved storylines in the film from the original book and move into Heretics of Dune.
This Dune film franchise is my favorite sci-fi book adaption and was as close to honoring and following the source material as could possibly be, especially when you consider the hack job that's been done with the works of Heinlein and Asimov for film and TV adaptions.
I absolutely loved Part 2, possibly more than Part 1, with the exception of Paul's missing sister played by Anya Taylor-Joy. Her only brief appearance is an exciting preview of what will come in Part 3, I just wish we got more of her in case Part 3 doesn't happen.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",A cinematic masterpiece. I felt compelled to make a rotten tomatoes profile after seeing this film just to sing its praises. I have not stopped thinking about it since I saw it (last Sunday).,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",An outstanding movie ever I seen,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Ever since Dune part 1 was released, I've anticipated what Denis Villeneuve would do in Dune part 2 to elevate his adaptation of the sci-fi epic to the next level. I'm elated to say that he achieved this goal, and launched Dune Part 2 into the upper stratosphere of Sci-fi movie history. Everything about this movie was amazing; the cast and their chemistry with one another, the visual effects, the musical score by Hans Zimmer that gives you goosebumps during these intense moments, the pacing and storytelling are all major strengths of this movie and why I'll likely go see it a second and possibly third time. This was certainly a movie to remember, cannot wait for the conclusion in Dune part 3.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Kinda choppy story telling. No intermission for a three hour movie is crazy.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",so many new plot twists! It was worth the wait.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",just loved it i love the every image and music of the movie mainly it gives a additional boost to the character and totally loved the direction of the movie and each character was well played as per their roles...... i truly loved it....it the the best movie for me in 2024 as i seen till now...,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",An absolute EPIC Masterpiece. Denis Villenueve’s Dune Part 2 immerses you into an eye popping spectacle. Sci-Fi at its absolute PEAK. Timothee Chalamet has the performance of his life. Hans Zimmer’s score  transports us into a world full of deep Lure to lose yourself in.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","THIS MOVIE IS TRUE CINEMA, HIGH ART.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","After watching it 3 times, and twice in IMAX, this movie has become my favorite. Period.",POSITIVE

I need Dune: Messiah URGENTLY PLEASE. WHAT AN INTENSE ENDING.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","So much was changed from the book and not for the better. The movie was all explosions and no substance, the dialogue and performances felt weak and due to the changes, I didn't connect with the characters in the same way I did in the book. Why change what is already perfect?",NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Excellent adaptation and enjoy the focus and small changes- the imagery was breathtaking and IMAX experience was visceral.  Excited for more-fingers crossed.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Elite sci-fi cinema. Powerhouse performances from the entire cast, with highlights going to Chalamet, Ferguson and Butler. Denis Villeneuve is on another level with the cinematography, and the CGI is borderline flawless. A feat of modern filmmaking.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",Wow it was sensational. A masterpiece!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Sheeeeeesh absolutely incredible and creative adaptation of a work of art,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","The movie in terms of cinematography, and colour it absolutely nails it. The music is just on another level Obviously, Hans Zimmer almost always delivers. The directer Denis Villeneuve also has done a really good job on the movie. Has expected the acting is good, but feels over did at a few scenes. It not so accurate to the books. But it works. The representation of the futuristic tech in the books are really done a creative way..",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",The movie is a banger. 100% a must watch.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",This is Empire Strikes Back level quality. Fantastic on all fronts.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Phim hay ngoài sức tưởng tượng. Ấn tượng về âm thanh ở những phân cảnh chiến đấu.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Its much better than the 1st part altought the 1st was a OG. Denis will get an oscar oneday for his brilliant direction. In IMAX the cinematography the sound the score by Zimmer the fight scenes were more than outstanding. It was a lot darker but honestly it was a hell of a ride. NOLAN AND VILLENUEVE HAVE SAVED CINEMAS . THE AGE OF COMICS IS OVER.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Denis Villeneuve's Dune Part Two is a sci-fi epic in every sense of the word filled with mesmerizing visuals, a stellar cast and a beefier story than you'd expect from a blockbuster of this size.

"Mar 1, 2024","an absolute masterpiece, aliens landscapes, score and cinematography a film that set precedents",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","As good as this film was, I’d say it was a slight step back from the first. There were just so many pieces incorporated into this film, causing the plot to lose its depth. Villeneuve took on a very big challenge and came close to excellence. Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha was tremendous. Satisfying nonetheless and definitely worth seeing.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",It's like a beautiful painting. And I don't just mean the visuals.,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",This is an epic film like Return Of The King ADHD I predict a Best Picture and Best Director Oscar and possibly  Best Actor as well,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","This is the type of film that we only get once in an era. The type of film that will influence a whole genre, and hopefully raise the standards in Hollywood productions going forward.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Masterpiece , this movie went above my already too high expectations",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","This is an amazing movie as well as a skilled adaptation of Frank Herbert's work. The acting is impeccable, especially that of Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson,  and Javier Bardem. I've seen it twice in theaters and plan to see it again!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Absolutely loved this movie. Incredible soundtrack and adaptation from the book.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Absolutely blast! This movie displays the power or faith and prophecy which it alone (part two) is hands down the best film! The graphics are amazing along with the Hans Zimmer music… absolute blast! I'll be waiting for Holy War…,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",This isn’t just a movie. It’s an epic.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Dune Part Two is a visual masterpiece and please see it on the biggest screen with Dolby sound. You will not be disappointed.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I'm so grateful that I had the chance to see one of my favorite book series coming to life in this astonishing way. The whole length of the movie my eyes was in tears and I had the urge to get up from my chair and get involved in the story.

The visuals and soundtrack kept me in a dreamlike state almost all the whole movie. The cast was perfect for each character. I really believe them. Special mentions to Stilgar and Feyd Rautha, I think they deserves some big rewards for their great performance.

Even if you didn't read the books, this movie will take you in a place you've never been before. Dare to take this amazing ride and go see it. You'llll thank me later.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",There was before I watched Dune pt 2 - and there is after I watched Dune pt 2. Those are two totally different people.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Beautiful in every sense, immense cinematography and direction as well as artistic integrity",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Legitimately couldn't even move after the movie was over. Everyone was shuffling around leaving the theater and I still felt ecstatic. Can't even remember the last time a movie hit me this hard.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","You can't argue that the director here knows how to interpret a novel onto the big screen so epically.  Yet, I was left deflated by the end of the movie.  And I'm not sure if the muted response from others in the theatre, after the movie came to an end, was one of 'it just didn't live up to the hype', or that it ended so abruptly (or maybe it was just me reading too much into what others in the theatre were thinking).  But I hated that it ended when things were just starting to escalate.  And if there is no part 3 than I think this saga sucked big time.  I'm left with more questions which were never satisfactorily answered.  I can't recommend these 2 movies to any of my bros.  I guess the only thing left is for me to carry on reading the books - so yes, from what I've read so far I have seen where the director has deviated.  And to be honest I think it works much better considering the canvas he's working on.  But in my opinion it is a masterpiece cut short.  Much like what cutting The Lord of the Rings trilogy so we got the first 2 movies only.  I'll still buy the second movie when it is available for purchase, but I won't subject my siblings to sit through it. In summary an epic movie that falls short, but can be fixed.  Let's hope there is enough interest and financial success that they go on to add to the two movies they've made so far.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Acting was good, lead by Zendaya. She was very good, especially towards the end.

Visuals are good but the content was n't. 

Music was a letdown. 

Dragging in many places, some scenes were there for no reason and scissors could have helped.

Dialogues were not up to mark. was it a bad Voice mixing or was it the native language without subtitle , few scenes it was a question?",NEGATIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","An absolute masterpiece.

"Mar 1, 2024","Visually stunning.  Battle scenes had the good guys and the bad guys sometime indistinguishable. The internecine intrigue among the Houses and the Emperor makes it kind of difficult to follow the story line at times unless maybe you are a ""Dunie.""

"Mar 1, 2024","While altering the narratives slightly to fit better in a film format, Denis still creates one of the most influential and amazing sci fi epics of our time. Part 3 can't come soon enough, as I think Dune: Messiah will be a perfect conclusion given how closely we follow Paul's storyline.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","Oh my God! , what I have just seen in the theater 🙏

Dune part 2 has set a landmark in the history of Sci-fi movies just like star wars had done in 1977 🌟 Thoudh star wars is heavily inspired by 'Dune' book, Star wars has never done these types of production because it is quite impossible to translate the noble into a movie due to it's large scale. If anyone have read the novel, he/she will know the very well about that what I am trying to say.

But my boy, Denis Villeneuve has done something incredible that no one has one done in the Sci-fi genre. Arrival, Blade Runner 2049,, Sicario, Prisoner, Enemy, now Dune part 1 and part 2 .. All of his movies are great and incredible. I was totally speechless at the time of watching the movie.

The story, character development, medium pace screenplay, editing, cinematography has done on another level.  Again I was totally hypnotized by the score of the legendary scorer ""Hans Zimmer"". The production design of the movie is astonishingly beautiful and grand in scale.

 Oh, almost forget about the acting department  The central character """"Paul Atreides"" remarkably played by Timothée Chalamet. The deep layer,of the character has done so precisely that nobody could match him. Zendeya has acted remarkably well as her and Timothée's  relationships worked on the point. Austin Butler has done very well of portraying as villainous role. Josh Brolin, Florence Pugh ( My sweetheart) all of the side  characters has done so well that nobody can detect a single point of error from their acting

Above all, Dune part 2  is a masterpiece and it is quite unimaginable that Denis Villeneuve can  able to pull off what he has done  in this movie in the next installment or his next movie  🎦

Love you, Denis Villeneuve🎦",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Após conseguir sobreviver ao massacre que a casa Harkonnen fez contra sua família, Paul Atreides e sua mãe são aceitos em um grupo de Fremen. Enquanto sua mãe se torna a nova Reverenda Mãe daquela tribo, Paul vai ganhando a confiança e a admiração dos outros Fremen, chegando a adotar o nome de Muad'Dib. Ao mesmo tempo, ele ajuda os Fremen contra os Harkonnen, atrapalhando a exploração da especiaria por eles. Porém, os feitos de Paul vão convencendo os Fremen que ele é o Messias da profecia, alimentado também pela pregação da sua mãe. Se a primeira parte já era um espetáculo a parte, aqui Villeneuve leva a outro nível. A parte técnica continua fantástica: trilha sonora, fotografia, montagem, som, figurino, efeitos visuais, maquiagem, tudo perfeito. O elenco está muito bem escalado. Chalamet encarna totalmente o papel designado a Paul Atreides nessa história. Rebecca Fergusson entrega uma Jessica manipuladora. Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Stellan Skarsgard, estão muito bem. E as novas adições, como o Austin Butler, como o psicopata Feyd-Rautha, e Florence Puch, como a princesa Irulan, são excelentes. Duna é um Lawrence da Arábia intergaláctico. As metáforas estão todas lá. O salvador branco, o produto que todos desejam, a exploração de impérios, a revolta dos povos nativos. É mito fácil substituir os termos usados em Duna por termos atuais. Como dizem, a ficção científica é um gênero poderoso, pois permite que discutamos temas atuais ou complexos que são apresentados de forma disfarçada, mas nos leva a pensar. Boas obras de ficção como Avatar ou Star Trek permitiram isso e Duna, com as suas duas partes, entram nesse grupo. 2024 acaba de começar no cinema.",POSITIVE

Ok, let's do this.

This was the first time I saw a Denis movie in theaters. He is my favorite director and has consistently blown my mind with every outing (my favorite movie is his). And it brings me nothing but joy to say that Dune: Part Two is one of his best films. It is everything I love about his style of filmmaking put together with a story of mysticism, tragedy, religion, loyalty, and above all, faith. Faith on a better future.

Thimotheé Chalamet is electrifying here, as he dives into Paul's journey with bravery and knowledge. Zendaya is great and Rebecca Fergusson is amazing - very different from her in the first movie. Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are also very good in the little screen time they have. Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgård are all great as well. Javier Bardem is hilarious and portrays his extreme faith fervously. And finally, the most shocking, terrifying, effervescent, and transformative performance here: Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha. I didn't know he had this in him. He steals every scene he's in and is one of the best villains I've seen in years. Oscar campaign starts now!

The story is incredibly dense, but Villeneuve is able to condense it in 2:46hrs and make it one of the most intricate and compelling science-fiction stories I've ever seen. Religion and devotion are portrayed here as the different storylines are delicately knitted and built up until the final act. The themes of faith, destiny, conflict, power and greed are all adressed here in Paul's journey. There are scenes where the theater shook and my eyes were fed with some of the most awe-inspiring scenes that show the power that these themes carry.

I think the film could use another 5-10 minutes in the final battle, but overall the pacing is deliberate and precise like in every other Denis film.

The cinematography is incredible. The use of color, and camera placement come together to create some of the best shots in film. There were sequences where I had chills and my jaw on the floor. The sound design explodes the boom boxes and the production design just elevates the world-building. Hans Zimmer outdoes himself once again, now working with 3 main themes for Dune: the chant, the one from the first film, and this new melancholic and epic theme.

The final 15 minutes were electrifying and unlike the first film that was definitely a prat one, this one ends the characters' arcs (most importantly Paul). The final 2-3 minutes of the film set up things that are to come that make me extremely excited for Dune: Messiah. I need WB to green-light it soon and for Villeneuve to end the Dune trilogy and go on with his career with his name carved into the list of greatest filmmakers.

Denis said that Frank Herbert wrote Dune: Messiah because people misinterpreted Paul as a heroic figure, which he isn't. Villeneuve makes it clear here that Paul isn't a hero through many scenes (and one decision he makes), just perfectly adapting the book towards the writer's original intention and vision.

Dune: Part Two is something else. It's a giant in the Sci-Fi world that packs a punch in visual and auditory spectacle through one of the most thematically and narratively dense stories from the past few decades. It's a sight to see and beautiful to behold. Thank you Denis for keeping blowing my mind in relation to what film can be. Thank you.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","A must sée ! A brilliant Epic SF adventure with great characters arc and performances from every actors in it. Surprises by Chalamet and Zendaya who give us their best roles.

"Mar 1, 2024","A compelling, intriguing, and captivating narrative mixed with beautiful visuals makes this movie one of the most interesting of the year in all respects. It didn't quite earn the last star due to some elements I didn't fully understand. For example, (spoilers ahead) when Paul embarks on that journey in the desert and Chani finds him, the scene cuts rather quickly, and I didn't quite grasp why we didn't see more of that journey.

Other than that, I wholeheartedly recommend it; the length should not be a concern.

"Mar 1, 2024","I've seen it yesterday. I will see it again today. The movie is excellent, even though the story is somehow adapted and the changes might make the book's fans nervous at times. The ending is not what I expected and not by the book at all, but I understand the need to keep a link with the next movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Simply the greatest sci-fi movie of all time. Period. I think almost everyone agrees that Oppenheimer was the best movie of 2023. Perhaps it was lucky that Dune 2 got pushed to 2024. I think that says it all...,POSITIVE

We ❤️ Denis!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Saw it 6 times already . See it on the biggest screen you can see,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Visually impressive! Perfect soundtrack! In my opinion there were some parts missing that I would have liked to see. Paul taking care of Jamis's family. Chani's character was changed a lot and perhaps that's the thing I appreciated the least. However, I understand the need to make certain events different and more fluid. Chalamet simply stunning. On to the third part!!!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","10/10 this movie is probably best of the year. The storytelling, sound, action, heart, and pacing all standout. I would recommend watching this on IMAX or 4DX.

"Mar 1, 2024","I went in with high expectations and they were surpassed. Saw in imax in a new theatre with single laser. Sound design/score and visuals were so honoured by the theatre in a way I have never experienced. I'm at a bit of a loss for words other than generational, masterpiece, theatrical cinematic experience like nothing i have witnessed before. Loved the books and they did such a wonderful job capturing the source material. What is so interesting is how the book is so internal in its presentation. You experience the story from the mind of the character. In the film, the dialogue is there to support the film, which is primary here. The visuals, the cinematography, the sound, the score are all the story, and the dialogue is there just to help deliver that. It is so complementary to the book by doing it this way by becoming the projection of what took place in your mind as you read the story.

Well done. Still riding the high. It will take something truly special to replace this as my new #1.

Is there a better word than masterpiece?",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","As someone who has not read the books, I can confidently say I loved this movie. It conveys an epic sci fi universe while also presenting a very character focused story that involves lots of aspects of humanity like love, fear, greed, revenge, religion etc. It has great visuals and the use of audio / music is absolutely incredible imo.

 Also it has rather good pacing throughout, which is crucial for an almost 3 hour film. These new Dune film adaptations are seeming like a sci-fi Lord of the Rings quality trilogy. The hype is real.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Left goosebumps… I want to see it again,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",One of the best Movies i have ever seen!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",In all of Sci Fi this is by far the best film.  The first film set the bar very high and the sequel raised it to be the level where both films combined are a perfect film story.  Great characters and challenges surrounded by epic landscapes and top FX make these two films simply a classic that defines movie making in the future.,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","Mind blowing, huge and epic. It's long and a lot but definitely one of the best sci-fi films of the last decade. It's truly a masterpiece and the hype is very real. The production design and cinematography are jaw dropping. The cast is fantastic. Austin Butler will surprise and impress you. The last act is everything you want it to be and is super satisfying. Chalamet was transformed in the last act and delivered in a way that I wasn't expecting. The scenes on Giedi Prime are just….WOW. A+ 10/10",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","What an exhilarating movie. Always keeps on your toes while providing context. Chefs kiss, truly.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","a bit slow,  action was too much and unoriginal from the first part. underwhelmed and unsatisfied.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2024","The moment that final rousing sounds of Hans Zimmer echo through the auditorium and with a taunted Zendaya (Chani) on the screen, only one thought shoots through my mind: Have I ever had the opportunity to watch such an insane film. This film is so breathtaking to watch, with some fantastic shots, that you imagine yourself on Arrakis for almost 3 hours. The setting is so perfect that even acting can partially fade into the background. The visuals are something like I have never seen on a movie screen, sucking you into every shot or seeing yourself standing next to a raging sandworm. Not to mention the fantastic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, whose composition is at the hart of lifting you up in your chair. 

Part One had my interest right away, with its world building and way of storytelling. But the way part two presents itself is even something I could only have dreamed of. Even after reading every review beforehand about how overwhelming this piece of art is. It's all true. All of it. Sit back in your seat, and let yourself be blown over by a piece of cinematic history. 

The end of the film sets up a fantastic prelude to a third part. Although the ending deviates from the books, I can very well understand (with the thought of a third film) why these choices were made. A third part, which I will eagerly look forward to. And yes, this upcoming trilogy (especially based on the way part two presents itself) has the potential to rank among the greatest film trilogies our planet has ever known. 

Long live the fighters!",POSITIVE

The ending is better than in Frank Herbert's book!
I liked the cast. I liked the sound and visual effects – much better than in Avatar 2.

"Mar 1, 2024","Truly impeccable work from everyone involved. A movie that demands being watched more than one time, epic to say the least",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","A cinematic masterpiece and every new science fiction movie should be held to this standard that Canadian director Denis Villeneuve sets for this genre - and just cinema in general. Especially the third act is the most brilliant executed climax I've ever witnessed in theaters and you could tell when no one even dared to eat popcorn due to the fact that it was possible to miss just a second of the climax. Timothée Chalamet is an absolute stand-out in a talented ensemble - you can feel the walls closing in on him and the options becoming increasingly limited for the so-called protagonist.
More importantly, as a book reader and fan of Frank Herbert's books, it absolutely lived up to everything I've dreamed about. Denis Villeneuve and everyone else from Hans Zimmer, Jon Spaihts, Joe Walker etc. made this movie possible - they did the impossible of adapting such a rich book and do it justice.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",An absolute epic masterpiece. Quite possibly the best film I have ever seen. I loved Part One and the books but this is something special that will be admired for decades.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",This movie can walk straight up to the Greatest Of All Time list and join the league with the same confidence of Paul Atreides asking the Emperor to kneel.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Movie of the year candidate, but not without some gripes. The undertones of the book are spoon fed to the audience. Several changes are made to some key characters while other characters are more independent thinking than they were in the book. The movie sorts out some of the complexities the book did not entirely explain. Overall, it's in my top 10 movies of all time. Will watch it again next week for sure!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",One of the greatest sci-if movies of all time right now!  Definitely in my top 5!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Yes there are issues with this film especially the pacing at the end. It felt too easy, although epic! Part one felt like it was a tighter plot line while this was a string of vignettes. Either way I really really enjoyed this film. There is something about Denis' directing, Greg's cinematography, Hans' score, and the talent that make these films feel so real and so impactful. I've rarely left the theater feeling so much enjoyment. It's a must see in IMAX.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","""Long Live the Fighters.""

Can a sequel surpass the original? YES IT CAN!

""Dune: Part Two"" delivers in so many ways, making this one of the greatest science fiction films ever. With a runtime of 2 hours and 46 minutes, you can easily see that not a single second was wasted. Sound design was a key factor as it produced such an immersive experience, feeling every single bit of bass in the seats. Visually this film was spectacular thanks to some stunning cinematography. The cast was phenomenal, providing some of their best performances to date and can easily see some Oscar nominations incoming. Especially when it comes to Austin Butler stealing the show taking on the role of Feyd-Rautha, one of the best villain performances in awhile. To top that all off, Hans Zimmer continues to prove he is one of the greatest composers of all time with such a powerful and emotional score.

""Dune: Part Two"" is an easy reminder as to why I love films so much and Denis Villeneuve blessed us with such a beautiful and powerful cinematic experience.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","Dune Part 2 is a near-perfect adaptation. Checks all of the boxes of a top tier blockbuster as well as dips into some arthouse sensibilities for some awe-inspiring visual storytelling. Part 2 definitely felt like a stronger, upgraded film, in all aspects of filmmaking than the first. Even so, I can't help but feel that it is a bit rushed by the end of the film. The script left a bit more to be desired as far as tying up characters as well as expanding on others. Liberties that Denis took, to change/improve the film adaptation seem a bit risky. But, I trust that he has a solid plan for Messiah and mostly agree with those changes. I strongly feel that if deleted scenes are added in the future,(which seems unlikely after Villeneuve himself has constantly shot down suggestions) it would benefit the overall adaptation itch that hardcore fans NEED scratched. The world Denis and his team have collaborated on is so interesting and alive that the fans simply want more. With a runtime of 2hr 46min, I feel like this film as well as part 1, could have benefitted greatly from an extra 10 to 15 minutes. That being said, I had a blast at the IMAX and am definitely considering repeat visits.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I was really disappointed with this part. I loved the part one but here there were so many inconsistencies and changes of the pace so the all magic of Herbert's novel disappeared. This may be the worst DV's made and that makes me sad. My impression is, with amount of material this should be 2x 3,5hrs great movies. Now the second part is just a mere shadow of the first one. Something like Brian Herbert's writings to his father's talent. Also I was very dissatisfied with C Walker performance or again that was the DV vision of the Emperor.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","This movie is an old fashion Hollywood epic one we thought they forgot how to make. On the lines of Cleopatra 10 Commandments Ben-Hur. Saw it in IMAX and the visuals are amazing acting next level Austin Butler a new star. Set and costumes amazing sound and music score perfection. As a book reader I am fine with the changes to fit the visual format.  Actually, prefer this Chani over the books.  Go see this movie it was amazing",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","3.75 - Enjoyed this a little more than the first one. I'm not a huge Dune fan to begin with, but even I can tell that this was well-made and that the director has respect for the source material. Clocking in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, it is hefty. I feel similar to how I felt about the first movie: it's gorgeous, the score is great, and the action was choreographed very well, but I'm also not fully enamored with it. And I still don't feel a strong level of emotional connection with any of the characters; they all felt ""distant"" to some extent, so there wasn't a strong attachment to them. Austin Butler was the standout for me as far as acting, and the weakest was Zendaya's ""fierce"" face or ""scowls"" - she is not convincing to me at all when she plays that type of emotion. She does a better job at portraying fear/concern/worry. As with Dune: Part One, I have little doubt that fans will enjoy this immensely. Video review: https://youtu.be/8U-7z9pQ3OA",NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2024","Dune part two has no equal,  and frankly we're all collectively as a species unworthy of a feat of this magnitude. The significance of this story will be lost on many , the irony certainly is . 
To all who gave life to this epic , thank you . I have to go now , I'd like to watch dune part two again . 

Sobering,  to think life may best be observed while eating popcorn.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Absolutely exceptional. Dune is nearly impossible to get right in under 6 hours, but Part 2 did a phenomenal job of bringing Paul's first story to a close. Acting, directing, cinematography, and sound were all sheer perfection. 

My only wish is that they had more time to dig deeper into the lore before they dig into Messiah, but in order to do that Dune would have needed at least 3 films and they likely would've lost a lot of the audience with the deeper concepts.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","One word can sum up the movie…MASTERFUL.  What Denis Villeneuve did in bringing the book to the big screen is incredible. Every actor/actress was on their A game with performances. It's early in the year but Denis has to be an early favorite for an Oscar nomination and I would not be surprised if it wins in many of the technical categories like sound editing, score, costume design and various others.

"Mar 1, 2024",Great movie. Intense storytelling. Cast of giants.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Unbelievable movie!! Brilliant acting, story and visuals. Chalamet shines!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","The Good Stuff:

Bigger and badder: This movie cranks things up a notch compared to the first one. Expect crazier action sequences, more giant sandworms, and epic battles.
Deeper into the world: You get to explore more of the fascinating planet Arrakis, with its desert landscapes, Fremen culture, and mind-bending spice.
Character development: Paul Atreides (aka Timothee Chalamet, swoon!) continues to grow into his destiny, facing even tougher choices and cooler abilities. Plus, Chani (played by Zendaya, ofc) gets more badass screentime.

Heads Up:

It's intense: There's more violence and dark themes compared to the first film, so be prepared for some intense scenes. Maybe grab a friend for emotional support (or popcorn sharing).
Not for newbies: If you haven't seen the first movie, you might be lost. It's like jumping into the middle of a complex video game without knowing the controls.
Still complex: The story can be mind-bending at times, with lots of characters and lore. Be prepared to pay attention and maybe do some quick online research if things get confusing.

Overall:

Dune Part 2 is a visually stunning and action-packed continuation of the epic sci-fi saga. If you loved the first movie and are ready for a deeper dive into this crazy world, then grab your friends, some snacks, and get ready for a wild ride. Just remember, it's not your typical popcorn flick, so be prepared for some head-scratching moments and intense battles.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","One of the best movies to come out in the last 15 years. Modern movie makers could learn a thing or two. Serious, well acted, great visuals, had funny moments but nothing that took away from the seriousness of certain scenes. That last point being something that plague modern big budget films. Part one was good, but part two was phenomenal. This movie requires you to pay attention but man is it worth it. 9/10.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Epic sci Fi.  Probably more powerful than part one.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",A rare sequel that tops the original in every way (unsurprising since its literally part 2). Less burdened than part 1 and with a grand finish to complete it goes down as one of the best sci-fi movies in decades. Even if we never get another Dune movie this one alone earns the series place in movie history.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Now the novel, ""Science fiction's supreme masterpiece"", has a film to match. Though it strays from the book in a few unexpected ways, it redeems itself in so many others. It's an incredible feat in cinematic excellence, and I can't recommend it highly enough!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Okay. With every movie I'm hyped to see, I always need at least 2 showings for me to get a proper solid feeling on it. So for the last week I've left all my thoughts to myself for me to truly think how I feel about this movie. After my first showing, I loved it but I came out with a feeling I wasn't satisfied and it's probably because of the changes made from the novel whereas today I have no doubt in my head of how I feel. This movie is perfect.

There's genuinely so much I love about this that if I wanted, I could go through every single scene and say how brilliant it is. Firstly with the movie itself, the pacing is just godly. How on earth is that an almost 3 hour movie when it flies by faster than sand in the wind. Secondly the sound editing? Unbelievable. The visuals are without a doubt just the best thing from VFX to camera work to cinematography.

But finally the acting is where this movie shines. Every actor is honestly carrying this movie and that's what you expect with a stacked cast like this. Timothy is the definition of Paul Atreides. He was born for this role and I pray it's his legacy because he gave it his all and more. The scene in the sietch with his fathers ducal signet is one of the best scenes I've ever seen. His acting in the final scene is academy level he at the very least needs to be nominated.

Zendaya does wonders for Chani especially for me. As a huge Dune series fan, Chani is a good character but she doesn't at all stand out in the books. But when she was announced to be played by Zendaya I knew this would be a twist and man I'm happy with the way Denis took her arc. She's probably my favourite character in the movie which is saying a lot with how she's not even top 10 in the books. It's crazy how much facial expressions does and Zendaya plays that perfectly. The love she has you can read it just as well as the anger at the end. I cannot wait to see how Denis uses her in Messiah especially with how she's on a complete different path now.

The final actor that really stood out for me is Austin Butler. Doesn't have the biggest screen time but his role is perfect and I knew it the moment you hear him laughing in his arena battle. He plays this role in such a way it made me care for Feyd-Rautha even though he's a little no villain with little character outside of that. I could go on about every actor because they all do something that makes this movie special but yeah overall just a brilliant cast and a perfect movie.

The final thing I have to say is that score that plays from the moment the Emperor kisses the Ducal signet till the end of the movie and the score during the credits, godly level of work from Zimmer he was the best choice for this movie and he delivered beyond perfection for both Parts.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","In an era full of disappointing remakes and the old bones of dead franchises, Dune Part Two only has one thing to say, ""Lisan al Gaib!""",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",Pure Cinema. This is what movie theaters are for. The only downside is having to wait for Denis to film the third.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","The first half was all over the place! All it had to do was carry itself on the magic the first movie had, but for whatever the reason the story moved so fast and felt so cheap and for a moment I thought Villanueva had lost his touch, but the film came roaring back for the last half of the movie. Unfortunately, for me, Dune 2 doesn't come even close to the wonder, mystery, and the fine production Dune 1 carried all throughout its film.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2024","Have been reading and watching Dune adaptions since Dune 1984, and could not be happier with these two films. There are subtle differences from the book, but the story is streamlined right into your veins with stunning visuals and incredible acting from the entire cast. Villeneuve harvests all the spice in the third act… mind blowing..!!! I've seen it twice and would heavily skew to seeing it in IMAX as the best possible way to view a film that demands to be seen on the big screen.",POSITIVE

The visuals were beautiful, the music was great, and the acting was amazing, just like in the first film except better. Story-wise, they did make some changes from the book, some of those changes I actually liked and others I thought were a little odd. They also cut out a lot of scenes, plot lines, and entire characters that were present in the book. But wow… this movie is a masterpiece. If this doesn't end up being the best movie of 2024, then we've had a really good year for movies.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",A superb cinematic experience and a worthy adaptation of Hebert's material.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","A bit disappointed after Part 1, the movie seemed to move from scene to unrelated scene with no joining context. If you know the book you can follow it but I didn't feel that Villeneuve was telling a story. Context of things such as the Spice, ""why"" it was the most valued product in the universe and how that leveraged the power play with other entities such as the Bene Gesserit, CHAOM, the Spacing Guild all of whom had to satiated by the Emperor maintaining the flow to keep their support was not really explored. 

The changing of the waters was written out which underplayed Jessica's role and the immensity of Paul's act in drinking the water of life. Nor was the day to day use to extend life and give the Fremen their buzz and cement fellowship at the spice ritual.

Jessica's dynamic with Chani - well there was none. The key points being Chani understanding what Paul had done in drinking the water of Life and his Mother not having that same understanding of her son was missed and of course dumped at the end when the tag for a sequel over-rode the books ending. 

I also felt that, especially towards the end, that too many liberties were taken with re-writing the plot. I understand that the need to be able to encompass the plot into a movie, but timeline changes were poorly done as were things such as Paul's ascension as Duke over the Fremen. The pace was not varied enough for me; it needed a few more scenes where the plot dynamics were discussed to give the importance of thing their proper context.

Clearly plotted for another movie with Irulan, who had far more screen time than the book would have credited her with, looking to have a central role.

I really like Villeneuve's work, the job he did with Blade Runner 2049 was masterful I just came away thinking I hope there's a Director's cut. 

As a Ps. the ""Critics"" really fall down on this with on the one side some idiot suggesting that like Avatar, this is another metaphor for stripping mineral assets from an indigenous people..... the book was written in 1965 (and the Fremen were not indigenous to Arrakis) - on the other hand the loud bangs, big screen action and special effects were enough for most of the others to go overboard with no actual critique. How do you give that any credence....... studio stuffing the vote?",NEUTRAL

"Mar 1, 2024","Dune: Part two is more than a movie. It is an auditory and visual explosion of sensory stimuli designed to challenge your perceptions of what might be and your imagination as to what could be. To fully appreciate all that will become your audio and visual transitions to the towering and majestic world that only exists in the vast and unknown reaches of our universe, one must first become familiar with those who will guide your journey through the epic battles yet to be imagined and appreciated. The central theme will be the battle for the lucrative mining rights for the mineral SPICE on the planet Arrakas (a rack us). The battle for control of the planet and the rights to the SPICE mining contracts will be fought between the House of Harkonen - the bad guys - and the House of Atreides (a trade ees) - the good guys. A magnificent and dynamic audio crescendo will ultimately transport you to what will become a final resolution and reconning. An ending first suggested with Frank Herbert's 1964 publishing of DUNE. A book that would evolve to become 7-Dune Franchise publications.  Recognize also that your journey will take 2 hours and 46 minutes of screen time for you to arrive at your final destination in space. The problem being that the mind can only absorb as much as the posterior can withstand. The intent of the program appears to deliver the maximum capabilities of CGI and Audio electronic wizardry almost at the expense of a condensed story line. The acting is good. The electronic delivery systems are better. If you enjoy an action movie whose core lies in the powers of both the occult and the mystical powers of the yet to come - strong kidneys will be required to carry you through to the sign on the screen indicating THE END.

"Mar 1, 2024","Overall, this was a very enjoyable film.  Visually magnificent with excellent acting performances by pretty much everybody.  Pacing is a little slow at times, and the story bogs down a bit with the Harkonnens.  My biggest disappointment was in the epic final battle, which was over in all of three minutes.  Storywise the movie stayed fairly close to the books, though not as well as the Sci Fi channel version.  The role of spice in space travel was criminally neglected, and the guild does not even make an appearance in the movie.  Nor does Thufir Hawat, whose fate is a complete mystery.  Also disappointed not to see Aliyah as a child.  All that said, it was definitely worth seeing in a movie theater.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","One of the best sci-fi movies I've seen. While the movie is still an adaptation of the book it's still very loyal and one of the most mesmerizing movies you'll watch. I sat through the entire movie never getting bored with it and eyes glued to the screen. The cinematography was fantastic, the dialogue was good and the musical score was immersive. Also, the CGI was great.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","An Epic without compare. The cinematography alone was mind blowing. Let alone the highly detailed story. It is quite long, but if you want a thorough telling of Dune there's no choice but nearly 6 hours between the two movies.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","The first half dragged, stunning visuals, no real danger. Cool moments that dragged on until I was sucked out of it entirely. When the protagonist yells, I laugh. I also don't know how, but they managed to make every antagonist seem silly and for that I felt no real danger. Forgettable isn't the right word, more so predictable-- beautifully linear, devoid of subliminal, very in your face on what's to come. The obvious was well made though, meh",NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","An absolute masterpiece. Never in my life did I expect a film adaptation to be better than my favourite book, and yet here it is. Visually stunning, extremely well paced, and the story - how did they manage to convey more nuance with less dialogue? The plotlines that are changed feel more impactful, more pronounced, all the emotion is there, but here you actually feel the slippery slope of Dune Messiah, the heavy burden and the impending destruction.

When I was a teen I hoped someone would adapt Dune and do it justice. This is so much more than I ever dared to wish for.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","This movie was awesome.  The acting is phenomenal by everyone, especially Zendaya and Austin Butler, who put on one hell of a performance.  The cinematography and some of the action scenes are superb.  I enjoyed the score of the first movie a lot better, and was a little underwhelmed by Mr. Zimmer this go around, but still love the old themes.  I enjoyed the first movie a little more (95/100), but this movie was right on par with the first one, which is a feet in itself.  I felt a couple of scenes dragged on a bit, so i personally felt it could've been a touch shorter, but I l still oved it.  Overall, gave it a 94.8/100. Go see for yourself!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Villeneuve does not disappoint!! 
with a third rightly so being in the making in the foreseeable future; we might have a generational trilogy in the making.
Everything about this movie lives up to all the hype and i'm proud that Villeneuve gets to display his vision. It's time to put him with the praise that nolan and so many others deservedly get!!",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","I never wrote a review for the infinity saga movies, goes without saying that was a generational series. Dune 1 was awesome, Dune 2 is better, can’t wait for 3. Putting this series up there with the greats.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","The fantastic world-building continues in Dune 2 with phenomenal acting everywhere you turn. The strength of this movie (just like the first) is in its patience. The film never feels rushed, yet keeps you engaged. There’s vast complexity but even if you miss a few beats the story remains entertaining and fulfilling until the end. It appears we’ll be in for a treat for years to come with this proper adaptation of the epic book series. ",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",Glorious that's my word for this movie I was never at one moment bored it held my attention. They did make some changes to the story there were no changes that I thought were bad but just a different way of telling the story. Absolutely loved every performance in it Timothée Chalamet gives the finest performance of his young career. It was absolutely beautiful and epic I honestly did not see a bad performance. Special effects were on point the score was beautiful. It was so good to times at the movie felt too short because you wanted more. As someone who's read the books and seen 1984 movie the sci-fi miniseries this hands-down is my favorite adaptation of Dune.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Great Movie! Go watch in IMAX. It's not the best story but is visually stunning and entertaining,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","Visually stunning continuation, lots of action and interesting characters.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Dune 2 feels like it’s missing a script, fails in character development, skipped post-production, let a 12 year old manage the editing room, and did it all on half the budget of Dune 1. Seriously, I lost count of the number of times I fell asleep without missing anything. In all the ways Dune 1 delights, Dune 2 fails spectacularly.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","Dune part 2 is the sci fi Movie of this decade! 
It's the reason you're going to see Great movies today, but a mirror to what sci fi fans actually gravitate towards. I still continue to think about this movie and wonder if, through Witchcraft , has Heresy always been a foot in the genre of modern sci fi movies and TV shows.? Is this why some of the loyalist and fandome have been weird over the years though their fandom backlash and gatekeeping? Is it a cult of personality or cult of spirituallity?

was. huge fan of the first Dune, but part 2 is simply perfection.
love the adaption and the decision Denis Villeneuve took with the book for this second part.
everything is on point, the pacing, the acting, the action... 
can't wait to rewatch it tomorrow again",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",This is the best Sci-fi movie ever made. Disney Star Wars is a pile of dog turds in comparison. Actually SW shouldn't me mentioned in the same page as this. Dune is a masterpiece,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Had very high expectations upon viewing. It blew those expectations out of the water and then some. Truly the best we’ve seen out of Dennis Villeneuve; surpassing all prior films. Best director working today by a country mile. This film must be seen in theaters; remarkably stunning and beautiful. ,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",This may be the best so fi epic I’ve ever seen,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Excellent movie, you have to watch it in IMAX",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I really loved this movie. It was bigger, splashier, with a ton more action, much faster paced than the first movie (which necessarily was slower, perhaps, setting things up). I love that Villanueve finally plunged into the DESERT with full force, giving us a rich palette of burning orange, washed out, sun-bleached beige, and deep-blue night on the dunes. The acting was uniformly excellent.

And while I know that Villanueve had to make alterations to Herbert's sprawling, complex book, I must say the ending took me aback and I'm at all sure I liked it. It blew everything up in that subplot, literally — literally, literally — diametrically opposed to Herbert's final page.

Perhaps (fingers crossed) this suggests that the team is aiming for a Dune Messiah, Children of Dune or perhaps beyond (everything after Children seems to me rather desultory compared to the first three, especially Dune). But to have audiences who are not familiar with the story left with the clear implication (yes, some doubt, but come on) it did is actually kind of mean!

But I loved the movie. From the get go. If you are a Dune fan, see it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","What a space opera must be seen, restrained acting, intense action, restrained pace. The love for the work on which it is based is palpable. Florence Pugh is a spectacular addition to the work.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Great story and great development of major characters. Can’t wait for part 3!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Amazing. they really pulled it off!
I can't wait for Dune Messiah and I sure hope Villeneuve reconsider ending it there because we need Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, etc",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",By far the best movie I’ve seen in a while.  Can’t wait for Part 3.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Absolutely incredible. A 10/10,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",Excellent!! Even better than the first. ,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","All I can say is that when the movie ends, I'm torn between wanting to watch it all over again or needing a sequel. That's the quality of movie we want to see, and what production companies need to deliver. The movie is beautiful and hits all the points it sets out to. It's been a while since a movie left me breathless. Congratulations, and we want more. I don't need to say anything else, it's a 10/10 movie for me",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Absolutely phenomenal film. Adaptations often have to take risks, and Dune 2 took the right ones. I’ll be seeing it again this weekend.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",Totally transportive movie. I was on Arrakis for 2 hours and 38 minutes.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","For the person who likes to think, this movie is for you. The movie is dumbed down from the book, but the compromises in the movie I felt were necessary to make the movie comprehensible, otherwise the movie would need to be in several parts, leading to a fan revolt. The movie for me makes the book come alive, it was just how I envisioned the book. 
Be forewarned if you like simplistic movies you will hate this movie, go watch Star Wars instead.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",I loved it. Ima watch it again. IMAX is a must in the movie.,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","Dune: Part 2 is a solid movie with a few surprises, and man! this movie makes you want to ride a sandworm.  Not sure who the bigger sadist is in this movie - Austin Butler or Timothy Chalamet.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Brilliant adaptation of the source material for the big screen! More of a focus on Paul's story than the 1984 movie. Scenes are well designed, well shot and don't look like CGI. Actors do a great job bringing their characters into the story.

For the length, there are not many unnecessary scenes or shots, but there are parts of the story that are overlooked to keep the story much more concise than the book.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Simply one of the greatest films ever. Denis Villeneuve has cemented himself amongst the pantheon of great directors. It is long, but I still left yearning for more, it's just that good.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Superb, everything that makes cinema great is in this movie. The acting, special effects, and score are incredible.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Phenomenal. One of the best movies I've ever seen and it might be my favorite movie of all time. Could've sat there another 3 hours through another viewing as soon it ended.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Read Dune for the first time in the early 70's as a kid. Dune Part 1 took me back to then. The visuals, the plot, everything basically perfect. This one only loosely follows the book and in doing so loses all of the subtlety and intelligence of the book and Part 1. Really, really disappointing. The specials effects were great… a confection with no real substance or message.  I am surprised and disappointed but apparently everyone else loves it so it has that going for it.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Horrible interpretation of the novel.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Slow! Terribly slow. It looks to me like it was made only to set up a third movie. Timothee Chalet was a whiner, crying about being a leader. Zendaya went from loving Paul Atredes to hating him. The fight scenes were unimpressive. Firing ‘Nukes’ at a target close enough to immediately attack was totally unrealistic and the least said about the final fight scene the better. ",NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","O filme é visualmente incrível, acerta bastante em representar um universo em que as máquinas tem um aspecto retrô, mesmo que futuristas. Sobre a história, o filme não mostrou tudo o que tinha para mostrar. As partes II e III do primeiro livro foram adaptadas nessa sequência, e, por isso, muitos detalhes foram perdidos. O filme falhou um pouco em deixar claro os saltos temporais, e teve que recortar algumas tramas, que necessitavam desses saltos temporais para acontecer. De modo geral, é um filme incrível, rápido em trama, mas incrível. 
[SPOILER]: Minha leitura de Duna é um pouco velha, mas não me recordo do início de uma guerra entre Paul e o Landsraad no final do primeiro livro, dando gancho para mais uma sequência. Irei ler os outros livros, com esperança de encontrar essa parte da trama.

Conclusão: filme que valeu a pena meus 20 reais de ingresso.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Loved the part one. This one was even better. Best movie I’ve seen in a long time.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Great modernization of the source material and stellar performances.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Awesome job by the director. I was worried he would follow too closely to the book like he did in Dune Part One. I still like the first movie, but this movie solves the weaker parts of the book, especially the whole climax",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Saw this movie on opening night. It starts right where part one left off and throws you right into things. The acting was simply amazing by everyone once again. There is a somewhat faster pace to this movie thanks to the increased action scenes. The music and several scenes were so good I forgot I was sitting in a theater with hundreds of other people.,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","Amazing, best movie I've ever seen. The thrilling action, stunning visuals and incredible story will definitely make you like this movie, especially if you liked the first one.

The story was really well written and managed to show all the important plot points from the books. The pacing is also a strong point, it manages to keep you on your toes without overwhelming you with constant action.

The visual effects are also incredibly well done, they were an incredible storytelling device that managed to make the scenes from the books come to life. They were made with an attention to detail that seems to be lacking in many movies made these days.

All in all, this is an amazing masterpiece that managed to perfectly portray the greatness of Frank Herbert's works. Definitely a must watch for every science fiction fan that love movies with lots of action and a great story!",POSITIVE

I’ve read the Dune and Dune Messiah novels and having the knowledge of the way the story goes in those books only makes the movie better in my opinion. The casting is perfect. The acting is great. Javier Bardem even made my whole theater laugh a couple times. In a good way of course. What else can I say? The story is fantastic. A must see. Hopefully an award winning film. Sci-fi world building, action, drama, cinematography, all great. 10/10",POSITIVE

Really the only cons I think think of for this movie are sometimes the pacing can be a bit off and understanding what the characters are referring to can sometimes be confusing. May take a second viewing to fully grasp everything. Other than that it’s truly a great movie. The score… my god how amazing. Hans Zimmer does it again (no surprise). Acting is top tier. Cinematography is an easy grade A+. This is a must see in IMAX. Don’t hesitate, go see it.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",I have been waiting for 35 years for such a visually stunning and captivating depiction of this amazing story. I'm speechless and sending this review from my car before I even leave the theater. Chalomet really embodies the terrible choice of leadership the Muad dib must make and the queue up for a third movie is obvious. Dune Part III which I'm sure will be based on Messiah is as good as certain. I'll be seeing this in the theater more than once. The sound! It's incredible. The entire thing was incredible.,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","I am still thinking about this film hours later. A true epic of modern sci-fi film making from a master director at the peak of his ability. Amazing cinematography, with such a resonant soundtrack, yet also delivering the plot in a concise manner that breaks everything down from the complexities of the novel. It certainly is a part two, starting from where the last ended, but the performances and character moments are delivered with more gravitas, more chilling emphasis, and more power overall across this film that I am astounded with how balanced everything was. Two and a half hours plus just flew by before I realised.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Highly recommended, and rest assured that despite what you see on the screen. no worms were harmed during filming.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Book fan, the director kept the feel of Dune even with the changes and I look forward to seeing part 3, the Dune universe did feel like it came to life. I would complain more about the run time vs. amount of story line accomplished but I really enjoy the whole artistic style of the crew from lighting to costumes and especially the set building. The crew deserves a couple Oscars, the acting was extremely good and Feyd was top notch and deserves an Oscar nod. I take one star away because I don't understand the changes to Cheyenne storyline and Aliyahs storyline so I hoping movie 3 ties it in. Anna Taylor Joy is for me a really good casting decision for her character so I will forgive missing creepy Aliyah. I hope movie 3 doesn't waste more than the first act in Cheyenne reconciliation and I am very curious how they adjust for Anna's age without somehow combining book 3&4 which could work if he picked up his pace. As a huge fan of the 84 movie and the sci-fi mini series and books 1-4, (still working on the rest) I appreciate someone representing not necessarily what's on page but still carries the emotional journey of the books, I would compare this for fantasy fans not familiar with Dune to Lord of the rings with the many changes for book lovers but the movies still captures the world and story they fell in love with. I think the biggest complement I can give the people who made this movie is my 13 year old never looked at her phone once and kept asking if they are making a third movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",An absolute MASTERPIECE!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",I was confused for most of movie. Might need to see again to see if it makes more sense. If I hasn’t seen the 1984 movie I would have no clue what happened. ,NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2024","Incredible film making at its finest. From top to bottom, this is a cinematic experience you'll want to be a part of. Many will say there are points where it's slow, but if you've seen the part 1, then it's nothing you're not ready for. Go experience this, on as big a screen as you can!",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Just wonderful, a culmination of what this franchise is. One of the best films I’ve ever seen. The story, the action, the visuals, and my goodness the performances. Had me at the edge of my seat the entire time. ",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Great special effects and visuals. However, Changed main storyline, end point is almost the same. But the thrill of the story of the book was lost. Destroyed Chani and who she represents. Instead of a powerful ending of unity (like the book), a garbled message of dysfunction.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","the most wonderful film i have ever watched in the cinema, it worth a imax ticket for sure",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","An absolute masterpiece. Movies like this are few and far between. The strong plot, the great music and astounding visuals make this a must see. Denis Villeneuve is the Spielberg of today. Young aspiring directors take note, this is how it is done.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",AWESOME! Really beautiful cinematography + a superb cast made this a standout from all of the recent films of blah. Timothee Chalamet is a bright talent! I hope they do the next 2 movies!,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Saw it for the second time and noted additional small Herbertisms. Best Sci Fi movie since original Blade Runner with Harrison Ford. 
         Deep, Earthy and Relivant to 2024.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",The visuals and music couldn't be better. This is totally worth it. Other movie directors should be ashamed for not having this level of quality.,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",Chills down my spine straight down to my legs. WOW,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","I took my son to the matinee as soon as he got out of school. This will be his STAR WARS. We both loved it. Now he is asking me about the whole Dune universe, all six books.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Just got back from the first IMAX showing and wow was I impressed. This was what the big screen was made for. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","As someone who's long loved the book and didn't quite see a literal adaptation on the screen working Villeneuve really delivered something timeless. Gone are the long trips and more psychedelic aspects, Paul has visions but all of the mysticism seems grounded in a reality of sorts. One of the more fanciful aspects of the book is his sister Alia and I really struggled to understand how they would adapt this in Part 2. No spoilers but she is paid homage in a meaningful but not overly fantastical way.

Herbert doesn't go into the gory details in the retaking of Arrakis, and Villeneuve absolutely knocks the movie portrayal out of the park. Also book lovers will notice this movie is not all tied up in a bow the way the book is, and almost feels like a cliff hanger. There's no reason to think at this point we aren't getting Part 3 which presumably tells the story of the Jihad and the second book Messiah.

Go see the movie, see it twice. See it on the biggest screen you can see it on. This is an Empire Strikes Back level event.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Better than part 1, but first hour could have been more engaging",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Easily the best movie I've seen in the past 6 years.   I can't think of one bad performance in the entire movie.  My faith is not fully restored in Hollywood but this is a great start .,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Best cinematic experience ever at a theatre. Definitely forgot to breathe in the final third of the movie. Still thinking about it 5 days later,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Dune 2 is long. 
Very, Very Long",NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2024","The scale of this movie surpasses everything. Feel like a war behind the screen. We witness Paul's growth to become the promised Messiah, and as he does, the terrifying sensation caused solely by the idea of what is to come is chilling.
Feyd-Rautha is terrifying in a very explicit sense; he is unpredictable and sadistic, truly relishing it, and Austin Butler portrays him magnificently. But Paul, played by Timothée Chalamet, feels like oppression itself, of a much more powerful and sinister evil but his more human side is not overlooked, as we see his suffering from the fate that falls upon his shoulders. All interpretations are truly magnificent.
Hans Zimmer provides a sense of epicness, without neglecting the mystique. The visuals are incomparable; the effects are polished to the smallest detail, making you believe in Dune, in Arrakis, and in the entire world built by Frank Herbert, and shown through Denis Villeneuve's vision. This great director continues to improve. With this film, he brings his sensitivity to tell the most epic story of his career, perhaps his greatest challenge, and he has succeeded.
I truly feel fortunate to have seen this movie in theaters and I hope that, just like the book did, this movie becomes a benchmark for propelling the future of Sci-Fi.",POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2024",It's Awesome. Spectacular,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","The movie itself is beautiful and any fan of Dune who hasn't read the book will love the movie. With that said, any fan who loves the book will not enjoy the movie. The basics are there to complete the story but, the changes that were made ruin the story. A character rewrite, characters missing, and story changes does not make up for the beauty of the film.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","Grand film perfect for IMAX.  As with the first movie, the plot has been tinkered with in some ways that are not majorly significant but minor enough to change the tone. The ending was not what I was expecting and so obviously sets us up for Dune part 3.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Dune is shaping up to be the best science fiction movie series of all time. Tantalizing visuals, brilliant acting, and masterfully written story telling, this is a movie everyone must see.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Saw the Feb 25 early showing in IMAX.  Incredible to watch on big screen.  Zendaya was a great.  Much of Dune II was grand, brutal, epic, and extreme.  Chani remained grounded, recognizable, intimate and sympathetic.   Easy to think back on her journey and with it, the larger story. A fine continuation of Dune Part I.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",I have now tried four times to say what I liked about this movie. Everything! In spades!! See it in the theater. Don't miss what everyone will be talking about for a while. I've got tickets for another viewing with family. Bravo to everyone involved in this production. Bring on Dune Messiah.,POSITIVE

"Feb 29, 2024","I wasn't a huge fan of the first movie, I'll just put that out there first. With this in mind, I went into the cinema with low expectations for this movie, yet hopeful that it would surprise me. This movie blew my expectations out of the water, or should I say out of the sand! Without going into detail, the pacing was better than the first movie and made me appreciate that this story wasn't crammed into one movie. Walking out of this movie made me feel like watching the first again, and also taking a look at the novel.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024",One of the best movie. Worthy of the part I.,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Awesome! Visually stunning and a welcome use of creative license. Everyone nails their role. I was iffy about Zendaya even after Dune 1, but now I’m team Chani! Can’t wait to see it again and again and again and…",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","I just came out of the IMAX screening... What can I say, it was awesome! The story, the visuals, the music, the actors! Everything is magnified with incredible attention to detail and makes this experience mind-blowing. Everyone is left speechless at the end of the screening. Not a word. It takes a few minutes to recover from it!

Je sors de la séance en IMAX... Que dire à part grandiose ! L'histoire, les images, la musique, les acteurs ! Tout est magnifié avec un soin incroyable et rend cette expérience sidérante.

"Feb 29, 2024","i have to put a review for this masterpiece, so here it is : the music, the scenery, the combat, the actors, the story, the special effect, every single field of this film has been polished to perfections with this second title of the trilogy.
you will shake when the fights happens, you will laugh every fiber of your being because of stilgar, you will fear feyd-rautha.   i cannot emphasis enough on how this movie makes you feel things i v never felt, before going to the cinema.
and extra plus : watch it on IMAX equipped theatres to get the effect of ''the voice'' it's an experience out of this world.",POSITIVE

"Feb 29, 2024","Dune 2: - An electrifying sequel that digs deeper into the sands of intrigue and adventure. With a plot as intricate as a sand dune's pattern and action that hits harder than a sandstorm, this film will keep you hooked from start to finish. Just don't forget your sunscreen. This is the type of movie cinema's were made for. 9/10, sandworms not included.",POSITIVE

"Feb 29, 2024",A really good second part. Incredible pictures with a good story.,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","It was fine, but you really need to see the first again, before watching part 2.

The music is nice.
Cinematic-wise it's good.

The film feels shallow in it's portrayal of the different sides: Harkonnen are basically visualized as nazis. Why nazis? Can't people be portrayed as evil without being nazis?
We don't get to see much of the Emperor's side - that makes the emperor feel as a side note in the story, even though the emperor plays a major part in the universe. The Sardaukar are fearsome foes in battle, more so than Harkonnen and this was not shown in the movie at all.
The Harkonnen forces were also defeated like it was nothing.
And the Fremen, of course, just can't do anything wrong.

I didn't get the feeling that anyone was at the planet's mercy - that's a huge part of the Dune universe and was better portrayed in the first movie.

I loved the original games and movies, of course that was a different time...",NEUTRAL
"Feb 29, 2024","The sheer scale of this movie coupled with Villeneuve's strive to perfect deliver the most exhilarating theatre experience. It's a once in a few years blockbuster! Timothee and Rebecca were the MVPs with everybody doing great jobs. You feel the beauty of Arrakis through Greig Fraser's eyes and it's so elevating when Zimmer comes in to lift your soul with his earth-shattering tunes. 
This movie is THE MAGNUM OPUS! A legendary sequel in line with TDK, TTT, and ESB.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Absolute masterpiece,gripping story,stunning visuals,great sound and amazing acting. Didn't notice how almost 3 hours went by.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","I loved the first part, and the second part is even better (although without Oscar Isaac). It is for sure one of the highlights in cinema, this year.
The visuals are stunning, personally I think the arena scene is a little to over the top... how big ist it ?  Too big! :-) You have to experience this movie in a cinema, with great big  screen and even better sound. It is fantastic. I wish they would give some characters a little bit more depth, although it is already a good level. Sadly, I still think Timothée Chamalet, was a bad casting decision. Zendaya wouldn't be my first choice either, but she does a solid job. I am really looking forward for the next chapter. Josh Brolin, and Rebecca Ferguson are the most perfect choices for this production. If u haven't seen it yet, go to the cinema... now!",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","An absolute gem and one of the best films I've seen in a long time! A cinematic masterpiece, this movie is incredibly well-crafted, with beautiful scenes, stunning settings, and a mesmerizing soundtrack. I'm truly impressed – wow, is all I can say!

Best Supporting Actor

Denis Villeneuve, now is your time to get Oscar because Dune Part 2 is so epic and beautiful! Every scene is so well conposed! And we got to see Fremen and Harkonnen world in details. Plus more of Bene Gesserit story!
Paul Atreides transformation from a hero to a ""villain"" is succesfully execute by Timothée Chalamet. And the way Javier Bardem portrays as Stilgar who represent fanaticism in the movis is excellent.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024",Absolutely unreal movie. One of the best movies I have ever seen and a massive step up from an already amazing dune part 1. This is a must see movie.,POSITIVE

Fantastic what Director, DoP, Crew and Cast have achieved here!",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Villeneuve vision for the adaptation of the first (arguably best) novels of Dune is to condense the story into it's essential elements and sand down the rough patches that resulted from writing sequels to the original Dune.  Dune, the novel, was never intended to go beyond the first.  Villeneuve has done an outstanding job which is demonstrated by the failed attempts from other writers and directors of the subject.  Whereas Part One follows the book closely, Part Two drops characters, events and the sense of finality that the book had.  This isn't a bad thing, but fans of the book should be prepared.  There is a downside to his achievement is that differs slightly in tone.  For all of that,  this is quite an accomplishment.  The film adds humor, shows the dangerous influence of religious fanaticism, and the Machiavellian maneuvering of self-serving politicians in a spectacle not seen in recent Hollywood films.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 29, 2024","This was a satisfactory sequel, albeit slightly disappointing. Good but not great prob sums it up. Weird to not have Alia around, and weird to have Chani speak in a crisp American accent. Not enough exploration/explanation of the Bene Gesserit ambitions, their abilities, etc. Few surprises.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","A cinematic masterpiece, a true epic, filmmaking at its perfection.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","If I had to summarize the whole thing into two words, I'd say: overly dramatic. 
Obviously, the special effect unit did the best job of the entire crew. The sound was so damn loud and dramatic all the time, I had the feeling I'm riding a massive whale-sized speaker. This kid Thimotee, or whatever his name is, is not up to the task of being the sci-fi Muhammed of the dunes, lacks charisma, acting skills and age. The guy looks like a teen, give him high school films to act in.
I almost fell a sleep 2 times in the cinema, and it was a 1pm showing, so i wasn't tired or anything.
There were some unexplained obvious plot holes which slapped my face directly and just left me dumbfounded. 
I'm a sci-fi fan, so I was entertained enough, but I wouldn't give this thing a second watch, its very superficial.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 29, 2024","Little Spoiler Alert!

If you didn't like the first one, this one also won't be for you. That being said, it's a nearly perfect second part to what hopefully will end up as a triology! The only real critic point is the lack of time awareness, since the real change from the book is the much compressed timeline (around 6 months instead of 3 years). 

The performances of all actors are outstanding, the sounddesign much more refined than in the first movie and the pictures ever so great. 10/10, can't wait to see it again on an iMax screen!",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","I just watched Dune: Part Two. Denis Villeneuve has done such an impressive job that, honestly speaking, this film, in my opinion, will be as historic in its genre as Interstellar. The actors have performed at the highest level; no one else could have looked better than Timothée - talent, that's talent. The music, the vastness of the world, the scope, as well as the fighting art - unique elements of the film that must be enjoyed in an Imax theater. I was surprised when I watched the first part, and that surprise continues. My body and eyes are still in shock from what they experienced. I recommend it!",POSITIVE

From the world building to the character development, everything was perfect, just as I had imagined it when I read the books.

"Feb 29, 2024","Dune: Part Two is one of the best produced films I have ever seen. The cinematography, casting, direction and special effects are all phenomenal. The filmmakers have paid intricate attention to detail and it shows throughout the movie.

The film follows two strong-willed lovers who are among the many fighters on the planet Arrakis. Paul wants to destroy the people who killed his family, but foresees a dangerous future. That same force is messing with his mind and may ruin his plan to save their people.

Some of your favorite actors are in Dune: Part Two! The main characters are Paul or Uzul (Timothée Chalamet), Chani (Zendaya), Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Stilgar (Javier Bardem), Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) and Emperor (Christopher Walken). The casting is fantastic; each actor compliments their characters beautifully and believably. I felt many emotions while watching it because of the great acting. When Chani is hurt by Uzul's sudden change of mind, the air feels tense and her anger is shown. Also, Uzul's mom, Jessica, is mysterious and changes her personality when she drinks the poison. This film is so well-produced. I am beyond amazed by the quality of the production. The camerawork captures the scenes so well, especially when they are in the desert. The special effects are mind-blowing, like when Uzul and Chani blow up multiple helicopters. The machine they are running from looks incredibly realistic and threatening. When Uzul has visions, the special effects are well-displayed. We learn that, by consuming Spice, the people on Arrakis can see the future. You know when they are seeing the future because their eyes turn blue. This film exceeds all my expectations and explores science fiction beautifully. The pacing is perhaps a bit off, but you might expect some slow parts since it is nearly three hours long! A lot of hard work went into creating this film. I highly recommend watching Dune: Part One to understand the concepts, the characters and their backstories. Dune: Part 2 picks up right where Dune: Part One left off. These two films really bring the Dune books to life. I applaud the director, Denis Villeneuve, for creating such admirable work. My favorite part of the film is when Paul (or Uzul) learns to ride a huge sandworm. The special effects are remarkable because you feel as if you are on the sandworm with him - the wind rushes, the sand flies everywhere, and the motion of the sandworm is smooth. It looks incredibly realistic and it shows how far CGI has come.

The film's message is to have hope and to always believe it can happen. Paul's hope carries him throughout his fights and he constantly encourages the others to believe that they can do it. He also tells his mother to not give them false hope over a prophecy. Be aware that this film has mature concepts, a lot of violence, profanity, and bloody scenes.

I give Dune: Part Two 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. Dune: Part Two releases in theaters March 1, 2024. By Sydney S., KIDS FIRST!",POSITIVE

"Feb 29, 2024","Visually stunning but, the pacing is erratic and, for book purests, too much is changed about the characters and too many important plot details are ignored to gloss over. A TV series delving into Herbert's incredible world building seems better suited than movie format.

I enjoyed this movie for what it was: a spectacle. I'll leave the substance for the books.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 29, 2024",Blown away by the Visuals. Denis Villeneuve have once again proved himself by giving us another Masterpiece 😍. I was soo connected with the movie. Thank you 👍,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","If you adore Sci-fi movies, this movie is made for you. The cinematography is beautiful. Hans Zimmer's score is great. There is absolutely more action sequences than the first one. Lady Jessica. The mother of Paul Atreides. She is horrifying. Timothée Chalemet acting performance is unexpected good. Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha is menacing. Go see the movie if you have the chance.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024",My heart was racing throughout the film. So much so I almost had a heart attack during the second half (im literally being so serious). Greatest cinematic experience of my life.,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024",This movie is incredible Absolutely the best have the fuck Dennis do that again. everything in this movie is very good. I love it.,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","That was a paper thin exposition of a deep and moving story. Pretty to look at but written as if someone had been given a synopsis of what happens in the books and was reciting it from memory, forgetting very important points. 
Unforgivable sins: Kicking Alia down the timeline, teasing her as if to whet the appetite for 'Messiah' but not dealing at all with the horror of being preborn. Moving The Barons death to Paul instead of her may have seemed a way out of messy exposition, but it just looked lazy. 
                               Compressing the timeline into approximately 8 months. Alia does not appear to be born yet at the end, making the entire movie only months long. Somehow, all the Harkonnen story fit into that timeline and the Emperor received a message, then assembled the entire court and Sardukar and got to Arrakis before Jessica gestated. 
                               Making Chani a surly, angry cuckold. I get it, the dutiful wife arc would not look good in todays environment, but her deep love for Paul, her loss of their first child, her grounding of the legend and her stoic acceptance of destiny is what shapes Paul into the man who can shoulder the terrible burden he sees in the future. Instead, this is all compressed into ""she'll get over it - I've seen it"".

I won't finish the list, but it is LONG. Was it a good movie, paced well and visually stunning? The pacing was off but not as badly as the first movie. The visuals and the feel were unparalleled. I'll give it one star for that and go back to reading the books.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 29, 2024","I did not wait for nothing. this film, this saga goes directly into my list of masterpieces to review again and again. This second part returned me, amazed me, made me feel emotions from the beginning until the very fine. thank you Mr VILLENEUVE.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024",This movie is absolutely fornominal one of my new favourites so jam packed such good direction and story telling,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Just like the previous movie, dune 2 is a masterpiece in all aspects of movie production, from sound effects to cgi, Frank's unique world of dune has been perfectly delivered to us viewers. Although there are a few changes from the original novel, it does no harm to the original storyline and setting of the characters. In fact, those changes has made the movie so unique that I myself who has read the novel was amused by them. Timothée again has proved himself as the best fit for playing Paul Atreides. Can't wait for the release of the third movie. 5/5",POSITIVE

"Feb 29, 2024","Go and watch ""Dune: Part Two"" now!!!!!!! This movie is a piece of art and a god. This is a absolutely must-watch movie of 2024. And maybe it is the best movie of 2024.",POSITIVE

"Feb 29, 2024","One of the finest pieces of sci-fi movie making since 2001 A Space Oddyssey.

"Feb 29, 2024",The first one was something new that's why I think Dune was better but the second movie had no boring scenes in it and was absolutely worth the time,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Saw it last night and am still basking in the afterglow from seeing this spectacle of a movie on the big screen. A truly Epic fiction, with gripping action sequences throughout the entire length. In the first movie, I thought the worms were pretty cool but didn't really get the whole hype around them, after seeing the second movie now. All I can say is. 
I get it now.",POSITIVE

"Feb 29, 2024","The movie was a great successor to the first one. The visuals and sound made for a top notch immersion, and both the actors and storytelling were great. Like the first movie, the 2 1/2 hours playtime felt like an hour - because it was that good. There should be more movies like this. It's really hard to find something to complain about. 4,5/5",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Despite some of the scenes that were quite monotonous, contemplative, and plodding, the rich storyline displayed an enormous cinematic experience of special effects with some intense duels and warfare scenes.",POSITIVE

"Feb 29, 2024",Masterpiece. A film for the ages,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Enjoyable but doesn't achieve the hype. Speeds through parts and then slows to crawl through others.

"Feb 29, 2024",The best movie of my life so far,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024",这个，第一次在烂番茄写观影感，因为反感 豆瓣的IP显示。    然后也想说，终于不用吐槽阉割版了，对电影艺术的基本尊重都没有。    沙丘一忘了哪一年，感觉有2年了，基本内容忘完了。    然后一开始看，也是有点蒙，但是很快就能投入到电影里，还是延续第一部，宏大，壮观， 沙漠背景也让人耳目一新。       至于主题，关于信仰，预见未来，古代信仰与现代科技的反差碰撞，爱情，等等。        整体的话，我觉得还是很震撼的，整体演员也都比较到位。   也是非常期待第三部。     忠于内心，就是最后背叛爱情这一点，不是很喜欢。,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Awesome! After having read the books, I was sceptical that it would be well represented in a film (such as the Bene Gesserit voices). But really well done.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024",The best movie I've seen in the last two years,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Saw the film at the first screening last night and left shocked. There were real GoT moments. The director is able to pick up the individual threads of the conflict between the personalities and pour them into a cinematic concept with independent characters. In the second part of the film, all the characters take another step forward in their development and the film ends with the knowledge that Paul.....! Check it out. :-)",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024",Dune: Part Two is a masterpiece. Give Denis Villeneuve and Timothee Chalamet their Oscars now.,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Absolute Masterpiece. I had I hopes for the second Part of Dune, because the first one was already awesome. It was no disappointment, the Dune Part 2 is even better than Dune 1 from 2021. The movie is around 3h long, but it feels no minute too long. Besides the epic battles which are perfect for the big screen, there is so much depth and meaning in the character development of Paul, Chani etc. 
Watch is movie in the theatre, you need to experience this on the big screen with atmos.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Compared to this poor extension, the first part now looks like a masterpiece. Nothing left from the Frank Herbert novel, nor the earlier screenings of this story. If writing the scenarios is considered the destruction of genuine ideas and changing content for some other totally non-inspiring one, and acting is plain posing and murmuring yourself in a chin, then underestimating the unfortunate audience really went too far, even according to the today's measures. This kind of film can only be seen as an example of how they should not be recorded. In my case, at least I know that I will no longer look from this director any future achievement.

It's best to try to forget this experience as soon as possible. I don't know how to help it, re-reading the original novels is a process too long, but maybe it's the only way. It is obvious that none of the participants in this non-work found it necessary to spend time to read the mentioned.

As for Christopher Walken, it's always nice to see him on the screen, but maybe it's time for him to, at least at the end of his career, starts choosing roles. In this company he really has nothing to seek.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Best sequel seen, plot faithful to the book and magnificent visual experiences that offer total immersion in the film. A must see in the best screen and audio service. Simply Amazing.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024",Amazing to see the possibility of advanced storytelling. I love every single picture.,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","A cinematic masterpiece. Like history was actually made. This movie left me speechless I couldn't even stand and I was crying because of how breathtaking this movie is. I don't even think I have the words to describe it. It's an experience, like even if you don't like cinema, this movie is so beautiful and captivating, you want to know what will happen omg. It is so much better than the first one, I didn't see the time pass, and I want so much more. Slapped in the face, and I'll never be the same anymore.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","23/7/23 - When the credits rolled on Oppenheimer, I found myself in an ironic melancholy as the thought settled - ""I may not see something as great as this for years to come."" 

Well Denis Villeneuve said ""Lmao bet"", cuz mark my words - In the near future, Dune 2 will be not only be helmed as an exceptional sequel, but also one of the greatest films of all time. 

Dune 2 is the epitome of ""epic,"" a convergence of the best minds in the industry crafting a timeless masterpiece.

While commendations will rightfully pour in for the compelling narrative, stellar acting, captivating cinematography, and flawless CGI, I wanna shed some limelight on the soundscape of the film - it's unsung hero.

Hans Zimmer, a maestro in scoring legendary fillms for north of five decades, delivers what may be his magnum opus. This film will fall flat without the grandeur of its score, which heightens each scene to orgasmic proportions. The amount of artistry that went bend this production is unfathomable. An achievement in cinema. 

Every penny invested in this experience is worthwhile. Films of such caliber emerge once in a decade, so do yourself a favour and make your purse a bit thinner to experience it in IMAX - not for the sake of extravagance, but because Denis Villeneuve envisioned this cinematic marvel to be savored in that format. This isn't a film to be casually torrented and watched at home.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","I watched it and it was ok. I found the acting of some of the characters a bit odd and off putting. The Chani and Glossu characters were so transparent and poor acted. Chani felt like I was watching a teen romcom at times. The cinematography was amazing as were the special effects. I just cant get past the fact that I felt bored, almost like I was watching something that had no point and no real climax. Sad, since I have loved the books and the original movie so much.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 29, 2024","WOW! Exceeded my expectations. No spoilers, I’ll only say this movie covers a lot of good stuff! Incredible acting and very gripping, there was a couple times I caught myself squeezing my wife’s hand lol. Go see the movie and enjoy!",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","There is no doubt, this is a visual cinematic masterpiece. The problem is, if the Skript is flawed, the pictures can not safe a bad movie. 
Every character depth is lost and in the end you walk out of a movie ending up hating everybody our thinking they are complete idiots. In the book the characters are not less horrible (but definitely less stupid), but there is a deep reason for the individual behavior. This is completely lost, due to squeezing two movies into one. 
I get, that things like foresight are hard to visualize but I had hope after the first movie (which I loved). Let's just say, they changed the approach slightly and by doing this completely missed a key element of the Story.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 29, 2024",An incredible adaption that changes so many details from the book but captures the essence of Dune. long time fans and non book readers can both get a lot out of this.,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","I saw the film during fan preview night in Los Angeles. The film moves right along, I wish it did drag on at certain moments. But I loved it, I can’t wait to see it again this weekend. A must see for Sci-Fi fans!",POSITIVE

"Feb 29, 2024","The only thing I can say against this movie is that it felt rushed, only because I have read the book so many times.  Other than that it's a masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","This film unfortunately fell extremely short in anything but runtime, Ruined by excessive length and disjointed storytelling. Prolonged scenes and abrupt shifts in focus, along with the introduction of numerous characters, left much to be desired, resulting in a disappointing cinematic experience.

A half star is being generous.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","It is both very satisfying and somewhat underwhelming. Yes, there is the uprising, the battles, revenge and contest for the throne. And there is a compelling depiction on how fanaticism can take over (best part of the film is Paul's transformation into a Prophet-Savior of Fremen - how his unwillingness only brings about the inevitable). But finale disappoints, deaths of key antagonists become a mere technicality. And so does the romantic storyline. Yet the big story is far from over, the loose ends can only be tied by a sequel. Which is already in the works, it seems.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 29, 2024","The cinematography is incredible.  The acting is very good and the musical score is as epic as the story.  But…as a life long fan of the original book and the entire grand epic that followed, I was disappointed.  Huge chunks of the plot were cut out, ignored or inexplicably changed.  The time frame of the book was 4-5 years but Jessica still hasn’t given birth to Alia when the movie ends.  Apparently the rulers of the universe can be overthrown in a weekend and with about the same preparation as a Fourth of July barbecue.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 29, 2024","Yeah...nah...at least i could enjoy a morning rest at movies.,,,3 hours!

"Feb 29, 2024","I watched Dune 2 this morning and it was honestly one of the most incredible films I've ever witnessed. Incredible directing, audio, cinematography, lighting and storytelling. So much show don't tell, action, Incredible FX, Drama, and world building that really is nothing that has been done before. Was much nicer having the storyline have some level of closure compared to the first film ending as the journey had begun.",POSITIVE

"Feb 29, 2024",Best movies for this year.,POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Unlike anything i have ever seen before (even dune part 1 which was excellent) this movie is a true cinemativ experience, a beautiful journey towards something grand, epic, emotional, creepy and dramatic.

It brings up alot of questions and got alot nuances and depth to the story and overall theme. With new characters, location and a more in depth look at the fremen culture the world feels much more alive.
On a technical standpoint it is also a masterpiece with everything from beautiful visuals to sounds and music which really makes you feel it. 

All of the actors did their role well especially Timotheé Chalamet which acting career mirrors Pauls character growth when he really steps into his big acting shoes. From a lost young boy in part 1 to charismatic and creepy messiah in part 2.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","I was fortunate to catch it during Feb 25th Fan First Premiere at IMAX here in Ontario, Canada. While the part two had to carry a lot of the story from the book, Denis Villenueve did a great job adapting it for the screen which meaning changing the timeline. But the decisions were spot on. Overall visually stunning as one would expect. You truly feel like you have been transported to a different world which still feels grounded and a place you can relate to. Unlike something likw Pandora in Avatar. It is a masterclass in sci-fi movie making. Watch it in the biggest screen possible.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Incredible cinema. A reason to go to the theater. From amazing sound editing to awesome visuals, this is a reason to see a film in large format. Add to that, a phenomenal ensemble cast. Just...wow.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",Fr the best movie of the year so far. A lot happened but the pacing was perfect we didn't move too fast nor too slow. I loved watching it without seeing the trailers fully. Because i didn't know anything about the plot. I got surprised and shocked many times by how well the plot moved and how I liked pretty much everything that I saw on the screen. I had heard a lot of praise for the movie so I had some expectations for it. But It was so much more than I thought. I left the theatre in awe of the art and beauty that I had just experienced.,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Le film de la décennie à voir absolument. L'univers est tellement bien maîtrisé, les acteurs excellent dans leurs domaines, la réalisation est incroyable également. On est imprégné dans l'histoire du début à la fin.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Wonderful, moving experience. The performance of all actors is breath-taking. The plot and dialogs are sensational, all the relationships, symbols and references to the world of power we live in. Trully, it was a spiritual, metaphysical experience.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Wow. This second part is absolutely full speed epicness all the way through. It is setting Dune up to be one of the best triologies ever made.

"Feb 28, 2024",One of the best movies of 2024 so far. It was thoroughly enjoyable and the screenplay was so magnificent. I was so engrossed in the movie that I just didn't want it to end. The acting and directing was so fabulous! Absolutely loved it!,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Absolutely EPIC! I have been waiting decades for an adaptation worthy ofnthr name ""DUNE"" and DV has given it to us.

"Feb 28, 2024","the film is fantastic. it is an audiovisual masterpiece and a very good book adaptation. I'm a little dissatisfied with some of the changes to the book, but that's complaining at a high level. Part 1 was closer to the book and that's why I liked it a little better. still a 4/5! I'm looking forward to part 3.",POSITIVE

"Feb 28, 2024",10/10 the Two Towers analogy is well deserved!,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Great visuals and sound but the editing is so worse! One-third of the movie is like ""you have to accept how it is now"". No explanation just cuts to a scene moments (days? weeks? month?) later and you have to accept that everything is the way it is now. I was extremely annoyed by this editing. 195 minutes long and so many senseless scenes instead of scenes showing what happened in the meantime. I was really looking forward for that movie but I'm badly disappointed.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Just Fan-FUCKING-tastic!!!
Loved everything about it!!",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",Dennis Villeneuve puts his usual outstanding visual art at the service of a perfectly crafted epic. An adaptation that builds on its source material with respect but serving the story and the characters above mere fidelity to the original work. Leaves the taste of great cinema and great craftsmanship. What an experience.,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","It's big, it's epic! Timothy Chalamet is one of Hollywood's biggest stars to be… if he isn't a megastar already.  Javier Bardem is great as the sort of Morpheus to Chalamet's Neo in this flick. Austin Butler is almost unrecognizable as a villain covered in make up but outside of a weird gravelly voice he's outstanding as well. I advise that if you see this film in a theater go ahead and pay the extra couple bucks to see it in IMAX!! It'll be worth every penny. 
Loved it it was 2 hours and 45 minutes and I still wanted more.  Go see it I implore you!!",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","A modern masterpiece. As the first one, the cinematic transposition of the book. Probably I'm going to watch it a second time in teathers",POSITIVE

"Feb 28, 2024","Dune Part 2 picks up right where Dune Part 1 leaves off, but unlike DP1, DP2 find itself unapologetically delivering on all that science fiction Epic should hope to deliver. An altogether different, altogether immersive experience that should be seen as not just a completion, but an evolution of storytelling from DP1. as an adjunct professor of film studies, I could not see a single flaw in the production, the sound design, or in the performance of the actors under the direction of a master Director. This for me will go down as one of if not, my favorite science-fiction film of all time.",POSITIVE

"Feb 28, 2024","Absolutely phenomenal! Dune Part 2 was incredibly faithful to the book, whilst having some very welcome additions that enhanced the story and themes present in the novel, and in doing so, helps lead even better into the story of Dune Messiah. I watched Part 1 and 2 back to back in cinemas and it was honestly the best cinema experience I've ever had. For fans of the book, you should definitely be happy with this film, and for the more casual fans who enjoyed the first one, everything great about the first is here, plus more action, drama and intensity. The performances were outstanding!
Any doubts about characters portrayals are completely gone. Timothee Chalamet commands the screen when he needs to, especially towards the end of the film, and Rebecca Ferguson really solidified this portrayal of Jessica as the best version we've seen so far in adaptation. 10/10.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Absolutely breathtaking. Left me speecheless, breathless, made me cry and want to scream. It was not a movie, it was something from another world. I have never experienced anything like it in my life. To call it a masterpiece is an understatement.",POSITIVE

"Feb 28, 2024","If you enjoyed the first movie, you should love this second part. It is an epic and emotional adventure.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Easily the best movie theater experience I've ever had (I was too young for LOTR and The Dark Knight, so I can't compare those). The changes from the book were a little tough to swallow at points, but in hindsight they're all pretty fair. It's so refreshing to have a movie of this scale treat you like an adult. Makes most of the blockbusters I've seen in the last 10 years look pretty silly in comparison.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","A HUGE film, a true epic, ambitious and delivers on every metric. The soundscape, the rumbling worms, the music-less fights, the acting, the casting - so so good.

One of the best films I've ever seen.

My only minor gripe would be the ending 10-15 mins seemed a little rushed and wrapped up too neatly.",POSITIVE

"Feb 28, 2024","So whoa! Oh my goodness I mean like wow, let me just say Austin scared me I couldn't look him in the eye when I saw him and his voice was very creepy but captivated and his voice sounded like video game kinda of I love this movie it was amazing so much wonderful work for Denis, You need to run not walk to watch dune 2 in March YES! go see part 2 in theaters March 1st! Austin performance captivating, outstanding, menacing, creepy, and will having you want to see his performance even more. Also Austin was scarier and more menacing and twisted then when he was Tex Waston and more I feel like both are kind of equal but Austin in dune was insane and I would love to watch it over again. I am so proud of how far he has came he is so brilliant in what he does he is so good with how he portrays his characters I can't wait to see more things he does and accomplish but wow way to go Austin congratulations.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Mind blowing cinema. Suspense, humor, yes, horror, and spectacular scenes. Ferguson and Butler shine. Must see on the big screen, IMAX preferred. Book purists will whine a bit, but this will stand as best film adaptation of Herbert's opus. Thank you Denis Villeneuve!",POSITIVE

"Feb 28, 2024","we saw this in a double feature with the first film and that was absolutely the right choice. part 2 was everything it needed to be, and exactly what i was hoping for as a fan of the books. i particularly like the way Alia's character was handled, which i always felt was rather clumsily executed in the book.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",It's simply the best SF film ever made. It surpasses every other franchises and Villeneuve vision is what SF films need to be.,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Is the movie good? In some ways, yes. Is it one of the best films made? Definitely not. Tbh, I was expecting much more. Many things make zero sense and have no coherent reason for occuring. The ending with Feyd-Rautha saved the entire movie from being a snooze fest.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","This felt much better than the first part. Paul is much more stronger, and became a commanding leader. The visuals and some of the large set pieces are stunning. Can't say this is the best in Sci-fi genre ever, but it will be listed really high in the charts for sure. Waiting for the full fledged war in part 3 now.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","one of the greatest movies in cinema's history. The SciFi ""Lord of the Rings"". Of course better than Dune (1984) and Star Wars' prequels. Denis Villeneuve is the best director of our generation",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Denis Villeneuve has accomplished a great task of bringing Dune to the big screen! The second part of the adaptation has only improved on the world building from the first. I found the visuals to be at the forefront of the story, with a great display of acting from the cast. The story is rich and fast paced while not devolving into a convoluted and confusing mess. A few standouts of the story besides the obvious Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya were Javier Bardem and Rebecca Ferguson. The movie left we wanting for more, even after its almost 3 hour runtime. I would recommend taking the time to see it in IMAX and possibly a second viewing, which I will also be doing. Looking forward to the next part of this beautiful and cinematic story already!",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","it was truly amazing, even better than part 1. the cgi was so good and the acting was phenomenal. 10/10",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",This is probably the best movie that I have ever seen. Absolutely beyond fantastic.,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",Astonishing. hard to really process what you've seen right after but you will eventually.,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","This could have been one movie, and it shows. Character and plot developments fall victim to visualization and world building scenery shots. Yes, everything looks beautiful and cool, yes the music is awesome, yes the actors are great, but no, I do not remain interested if you don't delve into the actual plot and characters more than you do world building. I don't care in the end how it looks if I don't get a proper character arc -  you know, dialogue, scenes that build on previous scenes of actors talking and develop the characters. It is a good story and should have been told with more emphasis on dramatic storytelling not on dramatic shot making. But cinematography geeks will love it.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 28, 2024","I've seen this movie twice now. And both times I was riveted to my seat. The scope and scale is better somehow they part one. The score sings! All Hail Hans Zimmer! All of the actors give such great performances. Some you may want a bit more of. I ADORED Javier Bardem in this film. Rebecca Ferguson is chefs kiss. Timothy and Zendaya....what can I say? They give such strong performances, and I think this is Timothy's best work to date. Hands down.....Austin Butler as Na-Baron Feyd-Rautha....is scary, In a good way. He completely committed to the deranged Harkonnen. Greig Fraser's cinematography brings it yet again. This film is gorgeous. And this is Denis Villeneuve's greatest film. Please give him the best director Oscar for 2024 already. Go see this in the biggest, loudest theater that you can. I'm seeing again opening night and that Sunday lol.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",boring some good parts but at times dead wait to rent,NEGATIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","I love both of the movies it's really good movie, Timothy Charmain and Austin Butler all actors were great I would see it again",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","""Dune: Part 2"" clearly begins the story immediately after the end of the first part. While watching, I discovered the most important difference from the first part: the amount of action was increased by 3 times",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",An excellent sequel that picks up where we were left in part one and builds tension from there. The immersion is astonishing as the world of Dune grabs your attention.,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Best movie of the year. Top acting, great visuals and the soundtrack makes it worthy of going to the cinema again.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",J'adore ! L'univers est vraiment incroyable.. le cinéma comme on en fait presque plus.. mais heureusement que des films comme celui-ci existent.,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","I loved the movie and I was so lucky to act in it and become the first Omani actor in a Hollywood movie. 
Epic is not enough to describe its greatness.
Denis Villeneuve did it again for the 9th time in a row, he gave us a cinematic movie.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","An incredible movie from start to finish. It's really well balanced with story and action sequences, nothing felt overdone. Loved that they took the time to really develop every aspect of the story, the writing and acting were perfect. And my god the music and sound FX are so impressive. I just felt happy that there will be a part three!",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Very elegant and clever moves to avenge what happened in the previous film, I liked the character development of the antagonist but all the actors and actresses played their roles very well, the music composed by Hans is beyond doubt, good work for Denis and everyone, extraordinary.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two is a stellar improvement over its predecessor. The slow pacing issues are resolved, making it a sci-fi masterpiece. The film crashes onto the screen with intense visuals, exploring themes of fascism and imperialism. A true cinematic triumph that elevates the Dune saga to new heights.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",An unexpectedly dark and extremely important movie. LOTR level on this one,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",Awesome in every way. Cinematic experience of the year. Not the best movie of 2024 (so far) - but a massive experience,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","A little bit less than 3h of length full of action! The way the story was told it's just incredibile, it's super easy to understand and it keeps you awake all the time!
Fantastic!",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","HOLY MOLY! 
What an absolute masterpiece! (which HAS to be watched in the cinema btw) 
And it is also true to the book, with its deviations making sense

Part 1 is essentially just setup/build-up to this magnum opus!
The soundtrack and sound design are both immaculate.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","I consider the movie to be an excellent continuation of the first part, and a wonder in itself. The possibility of a triology as magnificent as LOTR, is truly enthralling, and I hope that Villeneuve will be able to create a likewise experience. The visuals are undoubtedly stunning, and beyond anything I've ever seen in modern cinema.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",I was one of those who watched the movie at the preview. This is one of those films in which the 2nd film is better than the first. I am sure that the film will collect more than a billion and will become the best film of 2023 and 2024.,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Masterpiece. Just an incredible cinematic experience. Visuals, script, acting, sound design and Hans Zimmer's score. Everything firing at all cylinders. Highly recommended. Can't wait to see it again. And can't wait to see a 3rd movie if Villeneuve will be allowed to do one.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","It was amazing, visual effect, scenario, cast, book adaptation, everything was perfect.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Dune part two was the most incredible moviegoing experience of my life! What a cinematic achievement, a new bar has been set for all other sci-fi movies to come for decades! Long live the fighters!",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","This isn't a movie at all, it's an epic. People don't rate Mozart's music. This movie is not Harry Potter, not Lord of the Rings... but like War and Peace made in the Soviet Union. 
This is a world where dreams should not come true. You must strengthen your spirit and heart and listen to this song. Odysseus is not the only one who lost his time returning from Troy. Many heroes died there.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","It was very cool en fun to watch, beautyfull scenes",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","A true masterpiece probably the greatest sifi sequel of all times, Timothy chalamet was absolutely brilliant and the rest of the cast was also incredible, greatest depiction of a Messiah and how terrifying it really can be 10/10 must see",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",Really really amazing movie🍿,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",This movie was awesome and was way better than the 1st part.,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",Li San Al gaip !!!!!,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Action packed, unforced humor, integrated the viewer to another level so effortlessly. Anyone who finds something to complain about in this movie probably would complain about winning the lotto.   Would've stayed for 3 more hours if it kept going.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Ok, foremost its a dazzling visual feast, but so much more though
like its not just good, it enters the Pantheon of Great Sci-Fi Films of all time
but calling this a mere ""Sci-Fi"" movie does it an injustice, it transcends genres
the skill with which it shows and NOT tells many of the deep ideas within Frank Herbert's book almost defies what one can expect from a film
and yet also, it is its own thing very much from  ""the here and now""
so relevant to today and yet steeped in the shared myths of so many different peoples...",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Not only the greatest science fiction movie of all time, but one of the greatest films ever created in cinematic history.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024",The first Dune movie by Denis Villeneuve was fantastic and finally gave me the feeling of the book. The second movie which finishes the first book is just beyond fantastic.,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Phenomenal! Loved every second of the movie! Kept me engaged throughout, and the characters were wonderfully written! Excellent world building, and hoping that a third movie is to come!",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Dune Part II transcends the boundaries of the sci-fi genre. Denis Villeneuve has masterfully delivered a spectacle that's as epic as it is emotionally resonant. This film is a testament to the dedication and craftsmanship of the filmmakers. Even though he's only 28, Timothée Chalamet has cemented his place among the greatest actors to ever live. I hate to compare, but he's the next Daniel Day Lewis. He plays Paul Atreides with such visceral intensity and versatility you can't help but be in awe of this kid's talent. 10/10",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Totally breathtaking, amazingly performed and gorgeously shot, Dune: Part Two is a sci-fi epic and sequel that captivates from the start due to its emotionally fulfilling and astoundingly structured narrative that carefully and effectively builds its interesting characters and stunning world while also achieving a level of depth and reflection that few movies of this size does nowadays (fantastic score as well). Denis Villeneuve has once again showed why he is one of the most talented directors of our time.",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Great watch, with more story, depth and sand. ",POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","I said in my ""Dune"" review that Denis Villeneuve is a master of putting grand spectacle on screen. Part 2 was an outsized enhancement of it's predecessor. Seeing it in IMAX helped bring the massive landscape of this film into scope for the viewer.

Greig Fraser is a master cinematographer. The camera work, coupled with the special effects, have created a world that evokes a visceral feeling of realism. 

The stunning visuals were accompanied with a beautiful score to guide emotions and 
tactful sound design that was vociferous in nature but also withdrawn when it needed to be. Believable choreography & acting to boot.

A star-studded cast that never outshines their characters — only once I kind of got taken out of the movie by a character and it was because of weird line delivery. The story was drawn out but never felt like it was dragging.

A fantastic experience with a crowd & another cinematic achievement to add to Denis' filmography that will surely bring him more awards.

**MINOR SPOILER ALERT**

P.s. Javier Bardem was having a TIME with his role & Austin Butler showed off his range as an actor. Also, loved the surprise cameo from Furiosa!

"Feb 27, 2024","i used to love watching movies. in the latter half of the 2010s the emerging commercialization pretty much killed my love for cinema to the point where there can go an entire year without me watching a single movie.
this movie reminded me of what it was like watching something truly great. it feels like a lightning in a bottle type deal, so it hasn't revived my faith in Hollywood, but it was great to have that feeling of awe ignited again.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024",The tickets were refunded without my asking and when I showed up at the theater I was told the movie was not being shown. I drove 2 hrs. Total waste of time and money.,NEGATIVE

"Feb 27, 2024",Epic! Best franchise of recent times and one of the best films too.,POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","Ambitious, captivating, intriguing, and thrilling from the epic opening shot to the end credits. I viewed this film in IMAX Sunday night during an early fan screening preview event. I give Dune Part Two 5 stars because I believe in the meaning of it according to Rotten Tomatoes. Wholeheartedly, it is an absolute must see picture indeed! This sequel is on par with some of the greatest ones in movie history. It is The Empire Strikes Back to A New Hope, The Dark Knight to its Batman Begins, The Godfather Part 2 to the former, T2 Judgement Day to The Terminator, and The Two Towers to its Fellowship Of The Ring. I appreciated the balance of necessary screen time to its important characters. You spend time with the Fremen and experience they're point of view and then with the Harkonnens before the mighty clash between these great rival space factions. The conflict with both houses is complex but justifiable and I appreciate the way this film spectates on both sides including the emperor's. The war to seize control of spice production is vital and it's crazy to see these sides plot, sabotage, destroy, and kill each other over it. I hope the cinematography and perfect mix of practical effects and cgi inspire future filmmakers to come. Villeneuve is a talented director who has perfected his craft. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Josh Brolin are great and relatable. Javier Bardem and Austin Butler steal the show with their magnetic and charismatic performances every time they are on screen. Hans Zimmer never misses with his bass busting score. Dune Part Two is a must see masterpiece of breathtaking, epic scaled, Sci-Fi/Fantasy Drama. The two part saga is the definitive book to movie adaptation version of Dune.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","A must see, Dennis Villeneuve shows us again that he truly is the greatest film maker today.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","Great science fiction, the colours , the music, the acting. We really feel emerged for 3h. Thanks for all the team behind this masterpiece.",POSITIVE

"Feb 27, 2024","Masterpiece. An incredible blockbuster film. Amazing cinematography, visuals, score, sound design, and acting. This film excels in every category.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","This is the Dune movie I've waited my whole life to see.  Although there were notable exclusions from the story (has anybody seen a guild navigator?  Denis seems to have misplaced them) it was not noticeable in the moment.  Long run time?  Other than my knees telling me at the end that I sat in one spot too long, the pacing was never such that it dragged - I was engaged for the entire time, and it didn't feel that long of a run time.  10/10 for how Denis told the story.  Everything about this movie felt authentic and was spot on for the Dune story.  Quit reading this review and go see the movie.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024",Phenomenal. Best book adapation ever achieved on film.,POSITIVE

"Feb 27, 2024","I thought it was incredible. It's hard to call any particular actor out without writing an entire paragraph. Everyone returning from the original film has elevated their performance. Timothée shows maturity in this role. Austin was magnificent as expected. Rebecca Ferguson delivers an incredible performance.
I saw it on Sunday and already have my tickets for Thursday.",POSITIVE

"Feb 27, 2024","Dune: Part Two is a slow burn that pays off.

Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune: Part Two"" is a cinematic masterpiece that is truly breathtaking. It is an incredible combination of stunning visuals and an engaging storyline, which you should experience on the largest screen possible. As the second part of this epic saga, it builds on the groundwork laid by the previous installment. It takes it to new heights, delivering an unforgettable experience that leaves audiences in awe. For those who crave immersive cinematic experiences, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a feast for the senses. I regret not having watched it in IMAX to fully immerse myself in its breathtaking visuals, but even on a standard screen, the film's grandeur is undeniable. Every frame is meticulously crafted to transport viewers to Arrakis's rich and expansive world.

The film's heart features one of the most captivating character arcs ever seen on screen.

Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides is filled with layers and nuance as he undergoes a transformational journey that is destined to become legendary in the sci-fi genre. The film's emotional core is formed by Atreides's struggle to balance love, duty, and destiny, taking audiences on a tumultuous ride through his world of twists and turns. Although some viewers may find the pacing of ""Dune: Part Two"" slow at times, it's a deliberate choice. It serves the narrative well, allowing for a deeper exploration of Paul Atreides's character arc. Chalamet delivers his finest performance to date, capturing the complexity of his character with raw emotion and vulnerability. Zendaya also delivers a standout performance as Chani. She brings life and strength to a character imbued with a palpable sense of longing and determination.

It is an engrossing and immersive experience that keeps you engaged from beginning to end.

The stunning visual effects are truly spectacular, bringing the fantastical elements of Frank Herbert's universe to life with breathtaking realism. Hans Zimmer's score further enhances the movie's epic scope, heightening the tension and emotion of each scene. While some cast members, such as Christopher Walken and Florence Pugh, may feel underutilized, the newcomers like Austin Butler give standout performances that leave a lasting impression. Butler's portrayal of a conflicted and disturbed character is particularly remarkable, leaving the audience eager to see what he'll do next.

I give ""Dune: Part Two"" 4 out of 5 stars. It is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking that exceeds its forerunner in scale and ambition. The movie boasts mesmerizing visuals, captivating storytelling, and outstanding performances, making it a must-see for fans of grandiose cinema. As the credits roll, it becomes abundantly clear that the adventure is far from over, and the excitement for the next chapter is tangible.",POSITIVE

Dune Part 2 telah membawa saya ke satu semesta yang mengagumkan.

Sebuah filem  penuh dengan elemen seni berat yang membawa kita ke zaman peradaban baharu.

Plot digarap dengan baik dengan imej janaan komputer (CGI) yang berkualiti serta diluar kotak pemikiran.

Saya boleh bagi pujian kepada Pengarah kerana berjaya menggarap filem ini berbeza dengan yang lain.

"Feb 27, 2024","This movie kept everything awesome I loved from Dune Part 1 but added so much more with character developments, more amazing visuals, more action sequences. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Kuddos to every talent involved. Well done, Denis Villeneuve, you gave us a true masterpiece. Thank you.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","A master class in bad science fiction and poor movie making in general. The director wastes great actors by giving them little to nothing to do, avoids world building, doesn't bother with the most basic of plot revelations, and rushes an ending that makes zero sense.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","IT WAS AMAZING!!! Humor in the beggining, Stillgard was such a funny devotional southern fanatic. The scene of worm riding was jaw dropping and intense. Battles were beatiful. What a movie 10/10",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024",a must see in IMAX. Truly a modern day epic.,POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","Literally shaking after finishing this movie. Denis created yet another masterpiece, can't wait for part 3.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","Dune: Part Two is the rare example of perfection.  The pacing, the acting, the sound design, visuals...all absolutely perfect.  I was able to see this a week before release in IMAX and it's the most enjoyable movie experience I have ever had.  As an adult, I sometimes think, ""I wish I could still get as excited about things as 6 year old me would have been.""  Dune: Part Two will give you a childlike giddiness for all 2 hours and 45 minutes of its playtime.  I have not been this awestruck by a film since I saw Jurassic Park on opening night in 1993. 

This movie is just as fun for casual moviegoers as it is for die-hard Frank Herbert readers.

See it in IMAX if you can. It's even worth an overnight stay if you don't have one nearby.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024",It's a master class in how to make a sci-fi epic.  Everything comes together for one if the best movies in a long time.,POSITIVE

"Feb 27, 2024","Behold the power of cinema.  Incredibly beautiful, immersive sci-fi the way it should be in 2024.  You can see the passion of the film makers every moment on the screen.  Chalamet and Butler are unbelievably talented.  Zendaya was good but she did the best she could with the material.  Rebecca Ferguson's Lady Jessica is a force.  Watch Dune Part 1 then go see this asap.  No words can do this justice.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024",What Denise and his team have done with the source material is nothing short of groundbreaking. They said it couldn't be done. But they did it. The greatest sci-fi film of the century.,POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024",On par with the Empire Strikes back in terms of significance. Outstanding in every way.,POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","This rating is based on the IMAX viewing experience. A lot of this movie is larger than life, and as such, really need to be seen on the largest screen possible for the ultimate viewing experience. You may never get a chance to have the experience of Dune or Dune Part 2 again if you wait until it is no longer playing in theaters to see it. That would be a badly missed opportunity. 

But beyond the visuals and sound, which are both wonderful, the story keeps up a good pace at all times, handling Paul's journey with the Fremen between where we left him and the final confrontation extremely well. We see new sides of characters, mostly the Fremen characters, who are able to be fleshed out in a way they couldn't be in the first part of Dune. The final confrontation was handled about as well as it possibly could have, especially considering how quickly it passes in the source material. In this case I believe it was an upgrade to the book's depiction, and I don't say that lightly. 

Of course some things have to be adapted for film, but some changes did leave me scratching my head. I like how they foreshadowed Jessica and Alia's future roles. Seeing Paul come into his own was a welcome sight, and the lead up was well executed. 

Very happy with this adaptation, and is a must see on the big screen to fully appreciate.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024",WOW! Spectacular! Breath-taking! Amazing! Masterpiece! Those are just the few words that come to mind after having just seen DUNE: PART TWO in IMAX. This is master-movie making at its absolute finest. I can't wait to see it again. And again. And again.,POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024",Movie jumped into a continuation of the last. The scenes were well executed and the movie kept me at the edge of my seat. Definitely a 10/10 in my book. I encourage all those that liked the first Dune to go see this one too.,POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","Sets a new high bar for sci-fi. Cinema is alive and well. Thank you Mr. Villeneuve, we owe you a debt of gratitude.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","Breathtaking, and powerful!",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","Dune Part Two joins Godfather Part Two and Empire Strikes Back among the best sequels ever seen on screen. Also its one of the best scifi movies ever made. Cant wait to see Dune Messiah, especially after certain changes to one important character (not Paul)",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","Having been disappointed by Dune Part I, my expectations going in were quite low. So when I say Part 2 was spectacular, you'll know I'm not fanboying here. One of the more beautiful movies I've seen that didn't rely solely on its spectacle to impress. The story was solid, characters were better defined (in comparison to Part 1) making their tension and stakes feel far greater, and acting was impressive. Thoroughly enjoyable film.",POSITIVE

"Feb 27, 2024","It's one of those legendary sequels that takes the first one and improves in every single way.

A movie that you have to see in theaters because it's more than just a movie. It's an event.",POSITIVE

"Feb 27, 2024",This is the best adaptation of Dune by far.  Loved it.,POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","It's the best thing I've ever seen in a movie theater, and I'm old enough to have seen Brian's Song in the theaters. 

You absolutely MUST see it in Imax. Awe inspiring. I am a huge DUNE fan since reading thr books in 9th grade 41 years ago, but thr Sound/VFX/Music was a Giant Step beyond anything I've seen. Plus just the visuals DV cooked up...amazing. I'm good with some small story changes, nothing major, and pretty much all the actors Nailed It, especially Butler, Zendaya and Bardem, even though his Stilgar is a little too fanatical for Canon, but it works to set up the Jihad. TC also very strong performance. 

Really still kind of awestruck 24 hrs later.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","Epic sci-fi movie that reminds you of why you go to the theatre.  Great casting, cinematography, score, sounds, visuals - 10/10!",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","The best movie of the 2020s. The visuals and sound  are breathtaking a must see in IMAX.  Fight scenes were amazing. 
Biggest nitpick is the timeline of the story was shortened from 3 years to 6 months, causing some critical events to not occur.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024",Excellent movieeeee!!!!!!! Love itttttttt!!!!!,POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","The sequel to Dune part 1 is just visually fantastic. As a Dune book fanatic, I'm finally pleased that a filmmaker took the time to properly do justice to the overall universe this story highlights.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","Absolutely fantastic. I read the book, and although there are some slight changes which are almost necessary for the movie, it makes total sense. It is a visually astounding movie, as well as the acting from the all star cast also contributing to the overall workload. It is something that deserves to bee seen in Imax.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","The best movie I've ever watched,had goosebumps throughout the whole movie",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","Amazing! Huge Dune fan, I've been reading the books for the last 30 years, and even with the changes from the original text, you can tell Denis is a huge fan as well. The first part was a perfect visual accompaniment to the book, but the second part, along with its stunning visuals and well-paced storytelling bring Frank Herbert's vision to life in a way I did not imagine I would love, but do.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","One of the most captivating films i've seen in years, it's a large step above the first movie and truly epic in scope!",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","I saw an early screening of ""Dune: Part II"" on Feb 25 in a packed IMAX theater. I can not wait to see this movie again because I thought it was epic!
In my opinion, this is the best sci-fi and best sequel film I have seen in my 40 years of watching movies. It was a long movie but I couldn't get enough of it and I was deeply involved in the story unfolding on screen. I haven't read the books but did see the original ""Dune"" movie in 1984 and this has been a much better adaptation. 
Denis Villeneuve has quickly become one of my favorite directors and hope he stays on if they greenlight a Dune part 3 and I can't imagine the studio not doing it.
Another great musical score from Hans Zimmer. The CGI was amazing and I highly recommend you watch the IMAX version. 
Enjoy!!",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",By far the best movie I have seen in a long time. The space epic brings the beloved dune universe to its highest of levels. Great performances from the cast and denis has created an all timer with this film. It is a must see I fully recommend you seeing it on the big screen,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Wow, what a movie. Wow wow wow. I think I need to go and watch it at least twice more. On first consideration this is easily a 9/10. This movie is a cinematic masterpiece that is both sonically and visually stunning. There is a lot of love that went into the creation of this movie and it shows. Everything from the cinematography to the makeup to the costume design is so gorgeous. From start to finish the movie was engaging and exhilarating. If anything I wish it had a few more quiet scenes to let the great immensity of everything breathe. I don't say this often of movies but I genuinely believe that this movie needs an extended edition. If anything the film felt a touch short which is odd considering its near three hours of runtime. For those that are fans of the book, this movie may irritate you as it does play more liberally with the book than its predecessor did. As a fan of the book I will admit that these changes did irk me some but at the same time I am not convinced that they were bad changes and in fact enhanced the story telling and made the movie more cohesive. Go and see it on the biggest screen possible.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","As it was written. Dune: Part 2 is beyond epic. A thrilling journey of revenge fueled by sci-fi wonder and religious zealotry. Butler is psychotic, Zendaya is the heart and soul, but Chalamet delivers his most complex work yet. One of the best theatrical experiences of my life.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Dune Part 2 is an achievement. And is like Hollywood remember they can produced epic stories that tv still can’t match.,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Masterful adaptation.  Long time Dune series fans will be pleased to see how Villeneuve threads the needle perfectly with the central conundrum associated with Paul's character. We see each choice.  What drives him forward. Because the book jumps over Paul's maturation, the movie fills this in nicely.  Our heart is with both Paul and Chani (who is superbly developed).  Jessica's role is crystal clear as well. Of course it's a stunning visual masterpiece. And Javier Bardem provides just the right palette to see the effect of Muad'dib on the Fremen. I also appreciate how we see Paul's sister develop.  Finally, Austin Butler is astonishingly effective as Feyd.  
The Dune saga has been deftly woven in Part 2.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Stunning visuals and brilliant acting. From the moment the movie opens pre-WB visuals, the movie hits the ground running and does not let up until the end credits roll. A movie adaptation to be proud of.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Now this is a performance Austin Butler should win an Oscar for!
This was everything I wanted and more!",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Movie was phenomenal. 10/10
Loud and action packed. 
Heart breaking end for Chani but Holy Wars is going to be another hit.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","A film, which is a term I do not use lightly, of incredibly vast magnitude. One that far exceeded my expectations. With acting that while not perfect still does its job with spectacular effectiveness. Scale so fast that it just must be experienced in theaters and a classic plot based on a classic novel. The cinematography is breathtaking and the world building is far beyond even the highs of the first. You would be hard pressed to find anymore than a minor problem with it.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","What a brilliant and beautiful movie. Thank you to Denis Villanueva, cast, and crew for bringing an iconic work of fiction to the screen in a way that is even more moving than the first. Only a fan could have accomplished such a feat of imagination.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",10/10 would worm again!,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",It was phenomenal!!! I am SO happy that I was lucky enough to see this in IMAX. The feeling throughout the entire movie was just euphoric! Amazing movie,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Improving upon the already epic first installment of Villeneuve's imagination of Herberts timeless source material, Dune: Part Two improves on all levels and sets a new standard for SciFi movies and is probably the best one we're getting this decade.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Excellent follow-up finally to the first Dune book! For those hoping for more action, there is 90% more action than the first film.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Saw it last night at IMAX for the Fan Premiere.  My initial reaction was just.... WOW!
The scale of the film, along with part 1, was simply EPIC!  I already bought another set of tickets for the release on Thursday.   Great adaption from the book, though there are a couple of missing subplots, and other details that were a bit altered for the sake of flow.  All an all, a MUST SEE!",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Visually stunning. Amazing score and sound editing. Supreme character development - especially with Paul & his mom - and FANTASTIC ACTION. Just when I thought, ok that's probably the big finale, another epic moment comes along to top the last. And then AGAIN. 

Cannot recommend enough. Perhaps one of the highest compliments I can give it is, that it was The Two Towers-like…which means, we should all be on the edge of our seats for Dune 3, which could Return of The King the cinema world.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Denis Villeneuve's adaptation and direction exceeded my very high expectations. Staying faithful to the novel, brilliant choices are made to make the un-filmable seem real. Much more character depth than normal in an action melodrama. A true masterpiece of science fiction!",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","As someone who has already watched the premiere in Toronto, I can safely say that Dune II is definitely an unprecedented epic masterpiece. I dare not say it is comparable to the Lord of the Rings series, but it is definitely one of the most awesome science fiction epics in recent years, regardless of The soundtrack, graphics, plot, and special effects are all better than the first one. In short, just go watch it!",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","The movie was a massive pace shift from the first one, where it piggybacked off of the setup in the first movie to go quickly from event to event. Great visuals, great music, good acting, and the occasional funny moments all come together to make this a movie that you don't want to stop.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Saw it Sunday night. Still thinking about it the next day. It's visually stunning..yes but I was most shocked how much I loved the love story. Only thing that could been better was an hour longer to flush out some more storylines and more scenes for some characters with small roles yet massive presence. The third act was epic beyond epic. Can't wait for the third installment,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","The two stars are for the unbelievable visuals and score from Hans Zimmer otherwise it would've been 0 stars. I genuinely enjoyed part 1 as a non-book reader, but felt completely baffled by the second half of this movie. No clue what any character wants or why they make the decisions they make. So much A-list talent given absolutely nothing to do emotionally. Wanted to love this going into the theater...but really wanted to leave once I was there.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","This movie is so spectacular. Even if you never read the books (I didn't) or saw the first movie (although that is highly recommended), go see this one. It's dazzling - with stunning imagery, a complex yet clear story, compelling characters (perfectly cast), and a layered richness and depth that keeps you enthralled. A must for the big screen - I've never seen anything like this. We saw it during an early showing on Sunday but I want go back again this weekend to further soak it all in. I'm not a sci-fi person, but this movie transcends the genre.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Saw the Fan First premier on IMAX. Easily 5/5 stars,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Saw this in IMAX and was absolutely blown away incredible visuals, earth shattering sound effects, and enormous scale, action scenes. Not being familiar with the source material, the storyline was difficult to follow, but still an amazing film!",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Stunning use of actual effects and CG. A memorable follow up to the first film.,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",One of the best movies of all time,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Amazing in scope and scale. True to the source material. Simple perfection.,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Dune Part 2 continues the epic saga with stunning visuals, strong performances, and a captivating story. It's a must-see! It's incredible and you won't be bored. It's full of action and powerful scenes.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","The one regret I have about the Dune franchise so far is that I didn't get a chance to experience part one on an IMAX screen in theaters due to the pandemic. That being said Dune Part Two is an EPIC visual masterpiece and manages to surpass the first one in terms of intrigue and furthering the story. This is definitely the highlight of 2024 so far and a must see! Watching this on a giant IMAX screen with the booming score from Hans Zimmer is a thrill to behold. That score combined with Denis Villeneuve's directing brings the Dune world to life so well. While part one introduced us to the main players and their stories, part two has much more world building and far more moving pieces to the overall storyline. You definitely need to have seen part one to appreciate and fully enjoy the Dune experience. With everything set up in the first part, they're free to hit the ground running with this one and it's a nonstop thrill ride! 

I've never really been a huge Timothée Chalamet fan, but after seeing his performance in this and how he handles his character arc I'm coming around. Unlike part one there's much more Zendaya in here and she more than holds her own opposite Chalamet. Those two are definitely the leads, but the supporting cast does just as well. Some even with very little screen time also leave their mark. However, Austin Butler was a nice standout! Playing a ruthless, menacing and truly memorable villain. He comes into the story late in the runtime, but once he shows up his psychotic presence is made known. With some great action sequences, much better pacing and well written storytelling Dune Part Two is one of the best sci/fi films of recent years! Most definitely check this out in IMAX or Dolby if available. The third act battle is one of my favorite since Avengers: Endgame. Cannot wait to watch this again and I'm more than ready for a third Dune film, which they set up perfectly while bringing a satisfactory ending to this portion of the story! Feels too early to say it, but possibly best film of the year!",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Dune Part Two is a generational Science Fiction Masterpiece. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I was not born in time to see the Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now or Space Odyssey in their moment, so I feel especially lucky that Denis Villeneuve has proven the Hollywood Epic is not simply a lost art form. 

The best movie I've seen since Fellowship of the Ring, my favorite movie.

See it in theaters friends, Imax if you can. 😉",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Dune Part Two was a literal masterpiece that I need to see again ASAP. 

Loved so much about the film and it had really incredible performances from Chalamet, Zendaya, Bardem, Butler, Ferguson, Yacoub, etc.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",This movie ruined other movies for me. I got the audiobook ages ago and I'll be wiping off the virtual dust to listen to it to fill the movie-lover-shaped hole in my soul from this evil amazing movie.,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","'Dune' part two: a 'moral' between love and war, in the middle of the desert",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","As someone who read the books and a massive sci-fi fan in general, this movie is near perfect. Denis sets a new standard for science fiction on the big screen, something I didn't know was possible. An action-packed, emotional journey, this movie answers all of the complaints critics and fans had with the first film. The atmosphere created by Denis and the cast is breathtaking. It feels as though you've been dropped right into Frank Herbert's writing. The entire cast was spectacular with Austin Butler, Stellan Skarsgård, and Javier Bardem standing out in particular. Overall, I believe this movie already rests as one of the best sequels of all time and very well could be called the best science fiction adaptation to date.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Sci Fi Masterpiece that leaves me wanting more.,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",This film is the type of movie where you will be so happy to see such a great cinematic masterpiece the cinematography is so cool to watch on screen the music is amazing i'm shocked the best movie of all time for sure,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Tremendous visually, narratively, and sonically. Dune 2 is a spectacle that is worth a special journey to the most ideal audio/visual theater set up that you can find. Improvement in every single possible way over the first film.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",This is why cinemas exist it is an epic beautifully told richly detailed sci-fi film it is a symphony made by artists who are at the top of their game,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","They pack a whole lot into just under 3 hours. The visuals, action sequences and characterizations are AMAZING. Definitely going to see it a second time.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","An amazing feat of storytelling that does the source material justice while intelligently altering where needed.

With well executed and thoughtful story arcs and visual world building like few others.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Villeneuve delivers what may be the best two-parter film of all time. Everything that was setup in part one gets a paid off in spades in part two. It's an imaginative retelling of the story, delivered through an astonishing cinematic spectacle.

Chalamet proves himself a true leading man, Zendaya brings heart to the story and Rebecca Ferguson is at the top of her game. Austin Butler steels the show and becomes the star of the movie all through a long sequence on Giedi Prime. He is hypnotizing as Feyd Rautha, a villain like no other. Every actor in this film brings their A game and everyone gets their moment in the Arakis sun.

This adaptation is on par with the best of them, reminding me of what Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings. It's really THAT good.  Villeneuve cements himself as one of the best filmmakers working today. We'll be riding the sandworm for years and years to come.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",This movie has everything you need and been waiting for since part 1 ends! It's picks up where left off and takes off to another height. This movie dare I say perfect! This two part movie proves if you can be patient with world building and character building then the pay off of action and drama will be so much sweeter. Please give us more of this world!,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",One of the best films to ever grace the silver screen! Please go see this in IMAX!,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","goodness, THE SOUND of this film was incredible!! I could feel it in my ribs. It’s so good! There were some issues in regards to religion that kinda seemed like a joke in some type of way. I wish I could explain it better, but that’s the best I can do. It has a very interesting twist that I didn’t see coming. BUT I actually understood it. I know it will make some people mad (it irritated me too) but I understood it. Art is subjective and I know a lot of people are saying this movie will win best picture at next year’s oscars. While I understand that notion, I kinda disagree with that. This is a GOOD movie. But not a GREAT movie in my opinion. This year is still early and there are so many other films coming out. Overall, this movie has fun action, good character building from the previous film, and sets up a possible third film (which I think has been announced??). I give Dune Part 2, 4 Disco Ball Deathstar’s Out of 5.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","CINEMA!!!!!! Denis Villeneuve is the Lisan al Gaib of sci-fi!!!!!!

The visual spectacle of Dune: Part Two on an IMAX screen is truly exhilarating, electrifying. This is a pinnacle of cinematic immersion in a theatre. A production of such caliber epitomizes the essence of why we, as cinema enthusiasts, are drawn to the magic of the silver screen. The cinematography, meticulously crafted, exudes an unparalleled beauty that captivates the senses.

The masterful orchestration of Hans Zimmer's musical score imbues the narrative with an immersive ambiance that envelops the audience, transporting them into the very heart of the story. Timothée Chalamet's portrayal undergoes a remarkable evolution, infusing his character with a depth and fortitude that at times blur the boundaries between actor and character, making one momentarily forget that he is not, in fact, Paul Atreides himself.

The palpable on-screen chemistry between Chalamet and Zendaya lends an authenticity to their portrayal of Paul and Chani, perfectly capturing the essence of their complex relationship and intense love for one another. It is a pairing that is both seamless and complementary, echoing the nuanced dynamics of their characters' connection.

Experience this epic saga on the grandest scale possible, as it stands as a testament to the peak of the science fiction genre in cinematic history.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","I thought it was incredible! Truly epic. Visuals, acting, writing, story, score, all superb. Took a half star off for a couple very minor gripes I had, but nothing worth detailing.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","This is a phenomenal movie. I was fortunate and got to see an advanced screening in February. Here are some thoughts:
- Purists will be a little disappointed, a few of the characters in the books were removed and some of the critical plot lines were reduced.
- Pacing: the second half of the film happens quite quickly. They combined parts 2&3 from the book into one 3 hour movie. It's enjoyable, but condensed.
- The score is phenomenal.
- The fighting choreography is excellent.
- The acting is wonderful. You're never removed from the moment by an odd line.
- Incredible sets/costumes.
- They turned Stilgard into the comic relief, which worked out great!
- There's some great tension between Paul and others as he evolves into his new world.

Over all: loved the film. It will probably be my favorite for 2024. I wish the pacing was slower in the second half and a two of the characters from the past movie continued their roles as they did in the books.

Final note: though this is movie gaining higher praise than Dune Part 1, I actually think that is the superior film.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","How was this man Wonka?

But really, Timothee not only embodies Paul as a tragic hero, but adds gravity in every scene he's in. Timothee's supporting cast also does an amazing job at adding to the films overall intensity which furthers the Dune series' depth. Greig Frasers cinematography continues to be a landmark and inspiration to me, and when paired with Hans Zimmer's score, both beautifully translate the tense emotion on screen.

While there are some changes to the book, everything still works, and Deni Villenueve's work further cements the Dune series as my favorite.

Alright I'm going to go re-read the books now 👋🏽",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Understand goimg in this is the second half of one movie, NOT a sequel to the first movie. This is a gorgeous film (both visually and audibly) that is the best adaptation of Herbert’s masterpiece bar none. Villenueve has created a world that is frighteningly familiar and uncomfortably alien and it works perfectly. Great performances from entire cast but special shout out to Auston Butler’s Feyd Rautha who almost steals the movie from Timothée Chamlamet’s Muad D’ib.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Exactly what I was hoping for and then some. Outstanding visuals and audio. The pace and flow felt spot on. A fantastic cinematic experience!,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Dune: Part Two emerges as a cinematic tour de force, masterfully blending the bleak, tragic essence of Frank Herbert's universe with a renewed emotional depth and thematic complexity. Director Denis Villeneuve's sequel expands on its predecessor's world building with a deft balance of grand spectacle and nuanced storytelling. While it boldly steps into blockbuster territory, it retains a sense of elegance, elevating its narrative with intricate character development and a mesmerizing visual language. This sequel not only deepens the lore but also engages with real-world themes, making it a thought-provoking and visually stunning experience that resonates with both sci-fi enthusiasts and general audiences alike.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Great film, if like part one. You will like part 2",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Epic, bombastic, and immersive - this movie will knock your freaking socks off.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Absolutely brilliant movie. As close to a perfect movie I've seen. There are minor departures from the book, but overall, it's true to the story, and is the most enjoyable experience I've ever had at a movie. Acting, CGI, storytelling, pacing, everything is on point. the movie is a bit long, just under 3 hours, but every minute is filled with intrigue and excitement. 

Worth watching, then watching again. And then a third time.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Nearly flawless direction,  cinematography, set design, costume design, sound design, score, editing, & acting (yes, Austin Butler is very much the real deal). 1/2 star deducted because the runtime could - and arguably should - have been15 mins LONGER. It's A LOT. See Dune: Part One first.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",There’s just nothing bad to say about this movie. All of it works perfectly. It’s brilliant.,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Visually and audibly Stunning. There were a couple parts that honestly needed more fleshing out, and I'll admit that the direction things took was fairly unexpected. Overall though, it's a fantastic movie. More than worth the hour drive to watch! (Fan First Premier)",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Movie was absolute spectacle and a pleasure to witness. The movie expands on the immersive dune universe. By adding new characters without making the ensemble feel cluttered. Breathtaking cinematography captures this story telling incredibly well. Only critiques I have are nitpicks, NITPICKS! Not worth putting in a review. I absolutely adore this film and will need to watch a 2 more times to fully grasp what I witness last night.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",The movie exceeded my expectations (which were high already). Surpasses the first one and keeps building and expanding Frank Herbert’s universe. Character development is great. Cinematography is stunning. Truly a masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Movie was amazing. Probably the best sequel and movie period I have seen in the last couple years. Not a remake thank you for something new! Can't wait for Dune 3!,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Dune part two show us what is real insane movie,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","This movie blew me away. It is unbelievable how engaging and beautiful this film is shot. The dialogue, cinematography, and storyline are all A++ this may very well be one of the best sci-fi sequels to date. The dessert and Freemen come to life in this movie you get to see everything Leto was referring to about the Freemen in the first film. I am looking forward to the 3rd film and possible series.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Meant to be seen on IMAX. 10/10,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","I loved Dune 2. So so much to break down here, but they managed the story very well. It's a complex book and they stayed true to that even if at points it would have been easier to go more ""traditional"" paths for general audiences. Visually beyond words. A few gripes here and there, but nothing that makes me not dig the film. Amazing",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","A masterpiece by director Denis Villeneuve. Beautiful cinematography accompanied by bone chilling action. The on-screen chemistry of Zendaya and Chalamet is obvious, but the real strength of the lies with the supporting cast of Butler, Brolin and Ferguson. A perfectly paced film, will have viewers thirsty for a trilogy.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Closest interpretation of the books of the tv series and movies so far, beautifully done.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Dune Part 2 is a masterpiece. It takes every element of the first movie and heightens it to the next level. It's definitely not going to be for everyone, as there are some fairly strange scenes. However, every shot and film making decision had a clear purpose and accomplished a clear goal for the viewer. None of the more disturbing or repulsion moments feel unnecessary or gratuitous.

Finally, one of the best things about the movie was how thoughtfully and intelligently it handled the subject matter or religion and control.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","This is lord of the rings level epicness, so excellent!",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","We saw the movie last night (2/25) on a mini IMAX screen.  

Frank Herbert was a visionary genius, but he wasn't a great novelist.  I'm a book fan, but I understand that translating this thing to the screen was a big job.  Villaneuve's script is excellent.  Yes he cut some details.  Yes, the end is somewhat different than the book.  Yes he needs another movie (or 2) to make the central point about the danger of messianic leaders.   Great movie!  Highly recommended!

Look for an uncredited cameo by Anna Taylor-Joy as St Alia of the knife appearing to Paul in a vision.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","This film is a triumph. Denis truly understands what is at the heart of Frank Herbert's story and in the difficult task of adapting it to screen managed to make enhancements across the board. His ability to reflect the core themes through the necessary additions to flesh out a vague act three in the original book is astounding, and it's adaptation to a modern audience makes those themes resonate all the stronger. Can't wait to see what he does with Messiah.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","The critics aren't wrong on this one. This movie gets everything right. From the intimate moments to the jaw dropping epic moments, Villeneuve continues to show how big of a mastermind he is. There are changes from the book, but changes that make sense in a film adaptation. Changes I absolutely loved. I can't wait to see this film again and again.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Find the biggest IMAX screen near you and go see it in theaters. A truly exhilarating cinema experience. The cinematography, vfx, and editing are outstanding, and the scale of the action is unbelievably impressive. The score, acting, and terrific visuals all warrant goosebumps several times throughout the film. The story and main characters remain complex and ever-evolving so rewatch Part One if you haven't already. This is an absolute must-see.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",I had been waiting for a long time.  Saw the first one 20 times and I'll probably see this one at least 35 times…what an awesome movie that captivated the whole audience!!!,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Mr Villeneuve knocks it out of the park, astounding filmmaking on a different level, spectacular production values. The future is clearly practical fx and on-location shooting, the difference between this and shows using the volume/blue screen cgi is stark.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Just incredible. I felt as if i were watching something of biblical proportions take place,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Amazing experience for IMAX. On to the mark in the criteria of the story. Outstanding production/cinematography/VFX/Direction you name it. Hans Zimmer major contributor in giving goosebumps throughout the movie. Austin Butler nailed it, a more in depth buildup of his character would have been appreciated as well as development of Paul from an outsider to being followed by fremen was too sudden. Overall outstanding movie. Should watch in IMAX - worth every penny.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","This is a ""must see in a theater"" type of movie, circa 1977. Simultaneously, the viewing experience is both exhausting, yet exhilarating, leaving the viewer little time to process happiness or sorrow. A feast for the senses, yes, but also a thorough investigation into the dangers of fanaticism & cult of personality. The acting carries this project to new heights,  as it now seems unfathomable to imagine anyone else portraying the tragic heroes & villans of Frank Herbert's 1965 masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",An absolute groundbreaking achievement in cinema. This is a wonderful adaptation of Herbert's work.  Must see on the biggest screen possible.,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",This is the reason IMAX exists. Every frame of this movie is perfect.,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Dune - Part Two, in some way, is a film made of compromises, to bring to the big screen a book considered impossible to adapt, but perhaps simply not translatable in its original form, as indeed all literary works are. However, there is an element in this transposition that causes me quite a few perplexities, and that is the management of time: whereas the first part was very dilated and meditative, suitable for the story of a crisis, of confusion, of ritual death and rebirth of Paul , this second one is excessively compressed, so much so as to break the rhythm of the ""rite"". However, the story becomes less solemn because it does not have time to develop into a wide-ranging narrative, which would have needed not more minutes, but perhaps a clearer sequence of events, more time within the narrative. Instead, unlike the novel which develops the events of the second and third parts over several years, in Villeneuve's film we do not perceive the passage of time and Paul's narrative arc, or rather the narrative arcs, because he is an extremely structured that contains several of them, they simply happen without the narrative having given the right weight to these changes, despite Timothée Chalamet putting a lot of effort into transforming his character's initial confusion into authority. Dune - Part Two confirms itself as exceptional on a visual and formal level, re-proposing the aesthetic grandeur that struck me in the first chapter, also through chromatic solutions that prove to be particularly effective, contrasting the intense orange of the desert with a photograph of completely desaturated, by Greig Fraser. On a narrative level, the first part, which was more airy and solemn, perhaps convinced me more.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 26, 2024","The Sci-Fi/Fantasy Epic of our Generation

Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.
As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.

Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.

In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.
The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.

I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed right now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented agains this Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, perhaps it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.

Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.
Extremely recommended.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Epic in every sense. Among the best sci-fi and war films ever made with a heartfelt love story at its core. An incredibly timely film that does justice to the complex themes in Frank Herbert classic 1965 novel. Denis Villeneuve has delivered another cinematic masterpiece, one that needs to be experienced in an IMAX theater.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Dune: Part Two is one of the best sequels ever made, delivering on every potential of retribution for what was a sometimes slow-paced setup in the first film. The movie does  everything it can to account for the casual fan but takes off very quickly and never stops dancing through the world Herbert created for nearly three hours.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",This is the best movie I have ever seen in theaters. Still in shock. Wow.,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","This movie is a total masterpiece! I can't believe it won't make as much money as those Star Wars trash movies. You have to go watch it, you won't be disappointed!",POSITIVE

"Feb 26, 2024","Dune Part 2 Is Simply Phenomenal, & Extremely Entertaining! This Movie Will Have You Getting Closer To The Edge Of Your Seat The Longer It Goes On. This Movie Is The Definition Of Cinema & In My Opinion It Changes Everything & Will Mark A Pivot Point In Cinema History For What It Means To Be Considered A Great Film!",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","It was great overall. First third seemed a bit slow. 2nd third seemed, frankly, a bit down-the-rabbit-hole weird. The last third was EPIC in every sense of the word. I'll definitely need to see it again.",POSITIVE

"Feb 26, 2024","wow wow wow. Ive read the dune books fanatically since discovering Dune for the first time through the first Dune trailer and have been totally obsessed.

I could not have asked for more from this movie. A great great great movie to follow pt 1. Obviously it doesn't follow the book perfectly but it doesn't need to when done like this. Phenomenal but I'm so biased. The HUGE visuals, the EXPLOSIVE auditory experience, beautiful costuming and set design were perfection. They fit perfectly into what I see when I read the books. Some changes made were to some characters, timing and some for completely cut. Loved this movies pacing as well. My heart was beating out my chest towards the end and I was left devastated when it ended. I'm still processing as I type. They have to continue making Dune movies.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Faithful adaptation to the book, and maybe the most visually captivating movie ever made. Powerful performances given by multiple members of the cast. Only regret you'll have is not seeing it in theaters.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","I swear to the lord in heaven I do not write reviews on things but, Listen to me. Since the dawn of Marvel movies, I feel Sifi adventure stories have been kind of forgotten about or pushed to the side. I am a HUGE Marvel fan. So, hear me when I say this. I've seen every single Marvel movie in theater since Iron Man 2008. I come to you today to tell you one thing. You MUST go watch this movie. The story, the fights, the Fremen, the prophecy, the music, Paul, the action.  EVERYTHING. Everything about this film was so refreshing to see since Marvels glory days. Just purely amazing story telling and great quality, colors, cast, and a refreshing break from superhero movies. I am so thankful I was able to go see it as at a fan first sneak peek premier. It took my breath away a few times and made me remember why I love going to the movies so much. For the love of story telling. This is a MUST SEE.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Massively entertaining film! We were able to score tickets for an early IMAX release, and wow we actually think that the sequel bested the first. We plan to see it again as there was so much to absorb that we may have missed some details.",POSITIVE

"Feb 26, 2024","In all, it was very good. The beginning had some light jokes that made the audience be able to relax, but this was a trap as the movie ended up being a very serious and intense film. But this false state of security really allowed me to settle into the movie. Then in pivotal moments it really had me going, there were times I was joyful, anxious, sad, and even worried throughout the whole film. Then it was also very good at not being obvious what would happen. Kept me on my toes, curious as to what would happen next and never being able to predict it. As a stand alone movie it is very confusing, but it isn't a stand alone movie. Part one set up the foundation, part two sets it in motion and opens the world up exponentially. I can only imagine how part three will go.",POSITIVE

"Feb 26, 2024","There are very deep emotional entanglements and deep historical thinking on the religion, empire, dictatorship and so on. I can't ask more for one single movie to include all of the factors. The details in the whole Dune World is so well written. All the main characters did a good job. I will say so much thanks to the director for giving us a epic.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","The IMAX fan first experience was the best movie watching experience I've ever had. The soundtrack, the tgeater-shaking bass, the storytelling, the cast, and the visual effects were all stunning.

"Feb 26, 2024",Amazing movie doesn't follow the book exactly but does it great justice! I eagerly await how they keep the franchise going and plan on seeing dune part 2 in theaters again this week!,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Went to see it fan preview at AMC and words cannot describe how good of a movie it was. Dune part 1 was great but dune part 2 absolutely blew it out of the water. Even though it was nearly a 3 hour movie I wish there was more, it kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time, phenomenal pacing. And this was absolutely one of the best movies I have seen that took advantage of an IMAX theater, the shaking and sound was perfect for this movie. Just an absolute stunning movie and you must go see it",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","More visually stunning, more emotionally compelling, more compelling plot develolment, and more enjoyable than part one....and I loved that movie.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Must see in IMAX. This film is so fantastic, a true wonder of entertainment. The soundtrack, effects, acting, cinematography, all came together to make this sequel one of my all time favorite films. If you even remotely enjoyed the first film, you must see this.

"Feb 26, 2024","If you've never read the book, I can imagine this being an incredible experience. Holding the book very dear, I had a mixed experience. Script choices left me in varying states of scratching my head and rolling my eyes. I understand some choices needed to be made to adapt the book, unfortunately at nearly every turn in the second half of Dune the wrong choice was made. Visually and aurally stunning, but lacking in the script department.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 26, 2024",Just got home from seeing a Sunday screening. It was exquisite! Everything about it was powerful and the parallels between the resistance and current conflicts happening in our time. Amazing piece of art.,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","The most hyped I've ever been for a movie, and it delivered. It hits every note. Of course some things change from the book, but it's for the better of the movie. Chalamet delivers his best performance and Ferguson, Zendaya, and Austin Butler all give you amazing performances. It is one of the best sci-fi/fantasy movies ever, and maybe one of the best movies ever, regardless of genre.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Amazing cinematics, feel bad for other sci fi movies that will undoubtedly be compared to this high standard for the next 20 years",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",The best word that I can use to describe Dune: Part 2 is epic. Nearly perfect film.,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Dune Part Two is easily one of the most breathtaking movie experiences I have ever had. While I feel it's a bit stretched out in the first act, after a certain part in the movie it quickly finds it's footing. The sense of immersion that is brought to the screen by both Director Denis Villenueve and DP Greig Fraser is impecable. The actors do an amazing job charging the story with emotionality that I feel was missing a bit in the first one. The VFX and Sound Design are top tier, and many times had my jaw on the ground. See it on the biggest screen possible",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Absolute masterpiece of epic proportions. This generations Lord of the Rings,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",My god this film. Nolan wasn't kidding when he said this is Denis's Empire Strikes Back. Dune finally has been done justice by an incredible team and cast. I'll be back in a few days to watch again in 70MM,POSITIVE

"Feb 26, 2024","Well worth the wait, absolutely stunning visuals and incredible acting",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","This is the way movies should be. Being a Dune fan most of my life, I loved Part One. Part Two so far exceeded my expectations, truly one of (if not the) greatest science fiction epics of our time. Amazing choices on Denis Villeneuve's part in adapting Herbert's material. Pitch perfect performances all around, the score gave me chills. Truly groundbreaking cinema so far ahead of the curve, a masterpiece. I can't see this not winning Best Picture next year. The beginning answers the end. Mind blown",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","This takes place of my favorite movie of all time. Just returned from the early screening…. Holy cow. Epic, in the company of greats like Empire Strikes Back, LOTR Two Towers, The Dark Knight. Takes the platform built by Pt. 1 and exceeds it in every way.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Terrifyingly terrific. Soul-shaking. Religious. Not a film, but an engraving of a near-death experience, the feeling of rebirth, and the god-fearing truth that stimuli can paint.",POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Awesome. Way better than the first. What Game of Thrones should have been.,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",If you want to see the consequences of religious fanaticism. Just go watch it in IMAX. We need Dune: Messiah,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","This movie more than accomplished all of the promises it set out, absolutely mesmerizing experience. I loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it, but Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising sci-fi director of this age. I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields. Rebecca Ferguson, Timothée Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and Zendaya give wonderful performances, with the first three being standouts. Overall this movie deserves the universal praise it has received and might just interest those who didn't even enjoy the first installment of the series.",POSITIVE

"Feb 26, 2024",It was one of the best IMAX experiences I have ever had.  The sound design and score were amazing.  I love the first movie to death and this one is just as awesome in a different way.  The Dune Part One is paced and methodical in its approach to world-building. Dune Part Two is action-paced throughout and molds Herbert's story in a way that best fits the big screen.  Smiles and chills all the way!!!!,POSITIVE
"Feb 26, 2024","Saw in IMAX. Has to be THE way to see it. Hans Zimmerman’s bass-heavy score vibrates through you. And the visuals…. The best I’ve seen in a movie, ever I think.

"Feb 25, 2024","This is the most breathtaking movie of all time and PLEASE see it while it's still in theaters. It will change you. After this movie, it took me an hour to recuperate from it. I started thinking about the film ""Thor: Love and Thunder"". I used to cut it some slack because I really liked Christian Bale's character, but it was when Taikai Watiti came out and said that he made it just for money that I really began hating that movie. Right after Dune: Part Two I thought ""this is more than a movie"" but I realize now that it is the perfect example of a movie! it is how all movies should be: made with heart and soul that take the viewer beyond their seat. It's films like The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Interstellar and E.T. that define why we love cinema. They're dreams; an escape from the darkness of reality that help us understand the world around us in a different light, and we need more of that. Film, specifically the superhero and sci fi genres, is starting to become more factory produced than ever. For example, the film ""Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was a movie with a few cool things but generally had a very unoriginal storyline. But what does it get? a 92%. Critics need to start judging based on how much heart and soul was put into film rather than what their opinion is. Thank you to all the directors and writers who try. To sum it all up, Dune: Part Two is a masterful achievement in film and will bring you right through the big screen. Have a great day and remember, dreams are messages from the deep.",POSITIVE
