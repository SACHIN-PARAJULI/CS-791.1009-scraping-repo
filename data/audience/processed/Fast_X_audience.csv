"Apr 13, 2024","Jason Momoa is the only bright spot in this otherwise terrible film. Vin Diesel has driven this franchise into the ground. He has milked it so far beyond when he should have stopped, but I guess as long as the movies keep bringing in $$, he doesn't care how embarrassingly bad they are.",NEGATIVE

"Apr 5, 2024","Watched until I could no longer stomach it. How in the world this movie has a positive audience score is beyond me. Maybe it is a reflection of where moviegoers are, I don't know. This movie is simply ridiculous. Not Starship Troopers ridiculous. Ridiculous ridiculous. The CGI is ridiculous. The fight scenes are beyond ridiculous. The acting.....oh, the acting...ridiculous. That car chase/Raiders of the Lost Ark collection of scenes was extra ridiculous. Anyway, possibly the worst movie ever made. So bad that even The Rise of Skywalker looks Oscar-worthy in comparison.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 26, 2024",Wow Jason Momoa is AWFUL in this movie. Plot was already dumb but his joker style acting was just off putting. Worst movie of the franchise. I did like Reacher in the film he had great presence,NEGATIVE
"Mar 26, 2024","As a fan of Fast and Furious, this part really disappointed me. A movie about chasers turned into a sci-fi movie that doesn't focus on racing at all. The real F&F ended with part 7. I have nothing more to say, the movie was fun, but not what it should've been.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 24, 2024","It opens with family and barbecue... and revenge. The Fast & Furious franchise has become very proficient at making big budget, high octane action movies with plots that are clear and coherent. The main fault is that they often get so absurd that it's impossible to take it seriously, but that might be a blessing in disguise because it forces the plot into being kept simple and mostly straight-forward.  This installment mostly follows those patterns... and then it ends and there is no family, there is no barbecue, and the story goes into the void.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 29, 2024",this move is completely bonkers!!! fantastic!!,POSITIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","""Fast X"" is the highly anticipated tenth film in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. This movie is action packed and turns back to its racing roots for a solid chunk of the movie. That being said, it does contain an extensive amount of violence, especially for a Fast and Furious movie. While definitely not a Christian movie in any regard, it does have some good strong messages about the importance of family, putting others first and sacrifice.  

First Media Key: Balance
Balance is not a word that doesn't seem to be in director Louis Leterrier's vocabulary. I know that might seem harsh but there is little to no balance in this film. There is a huge amount of unnecessary violence and only a couple of dialogue scenes. Now while this is an action movie, ""Fast X"" does stray away from the balance that was seen in the first couple of films in the franchise. In the article it says ""However, what I do find troubling with this latest chapter is the foul language, the increased amount of sexualized content (including sexualized females), and the violence for the film has certainly increased"". 

Second Media Key: Attitude Awareness
This movie doesn't require one to watch it with a strong awareness of their attitude. This movie will actually most likely change your attitude in regards to family, in a good way. This movie is all about family, or familia as Dom Toretto, the main character likes to say. Whether your attitude towards the topic of family is good or bad, you will leave this movie knowing that blood is in fact thicker than water. 

Third Media Key: Dignity of the Human Person
While I am a big fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, they unfortunately do not do a good job in fulfilling this media key. And ""Fast X"" is not an exception. Throughout the movie, there are multiple situations where someone is knocked out cold and then shot. Shooting the person is unnecessary within those situations because being knocked out, they wouldn't have posed any threat. By shooting the already knocked out person, there is a lack of respect for the dignity of the person. There is also a scene somewhat early on in the movie where the villain Dante, props up the dead bodies of two people that he's killed and is painting their nails. This is a very disturbing scene because not only is it kind of graphic, but there is an extreme lack of respect for human dignity. 

Fourth Media Key: Truth-filled
This movie isn't the most truth-filled film out there by a long shot. However, it does have some very impactful familial truths. For example, there is the continuous truth throughout the whole film series that family doesn't turn their back on family, especially when times get tough. This is one of the main elements of family life. Another truth that is seen in the movie is we are all family. Looking at this from a Catholic standpoint, we are all family in the sense that we are all part of the family of God.  

Fifth Media Key: Inspiring 
This movie is definitely inspiring in regards to family. In the movie, Dom Toretto delivers lines like ""Family defines us. By blood or by bond, family is a powerful thing"". But Toretto is more of a man of action than of words; and that is seen very clearly throughout the film. He throws himself over members of his team when something explodes, he taunts the villain to chase after him instead of his family(his team), he wraps his son up in his arms and takes the brunt of the impact when thrown from a car, etc. This movie will definitely inspire one to appreciate, support and love one's family more. 

Sixth Media Key: Skillfully Developed
Although this film may not fulfill some of the other media keys, it most definitely fulfills this one. This film was developed with the Fast and Furious franchise fans as the target audience. This movie was one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year because of its continuation of the series. Similarly to the ""Barbie"" movie, this film really plays on the nostalgia that this series set with its first film back in 2001. Many characters are brought back and many are revealed to be alive and well, when thought to be dead. When the movie came to an end and the credits rolled, theaters were filled with applause and cheers.

Seventh Media Key:Motivated by and relevant to experience
While on the surface this movie does not seem to be relevant to experience, when looked at more closely it actually is. Throughout the course of this movie, Toretto is faced with the decision of whether to put himself first or his family. And of course, as seen in the previous films, he immediately chose his family. This is relevant because at some point in our lives, we have been faced with the same choice. It is also relevant because of the self-sacrificing aspect. Toretto and his team members are seen being willing to sacrifice themselves in order to save/help others. This is something that all of us have experienced, maybe not in circumstances as extreme as the one shown in the film, but similar nonetheless. Additionally, as mentioned for the previous media key, Leterrier uses the fact that this is the tenth film in the series to really play on the audience's nostalgia. 

Although this film is skillfully developed and inspiring amongst many things, I wouldn't recommend it as a movie to watch with the family or as a good moral movie to watch. Leterrier does a good job at continuing the Fast and Furious franchise when remaining somewhat loyal to its original racing roots. I think that my review of this film would be appreciated by some people and not by others because I was honest and tried not to sugarcoat anything. There will most likely be a large number of people who disagree with me because a good chunk of people who watched this movie are Fast and Furious fans. Others will appreciate it because I give my honest review and I look at this film from a moral standpoint.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 25, 2024","This movie was so insanely stupid. The acting was half hearted and the plot was insulting.  I like Momoa, but his talent was wasted here.  I could see what he was going for, it just didn't work.  There are plenty of movies that are enjoyable as long as you can switch off your brain - this isn't one of them. Brain on or off, it sucked.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 25, 2024","Agree what others said about being unrealistic, but I love the characters, specially the ones that you didn't expect to be there. Was just wondering what happened to Brian's children Jack and Olivia, knowing that this movie is about family. Hope they would show in Part 2.",POSITIVE
"Feb 25, 2024","Meh...except for Jason Momoa, his character is over the top, and made the whole movie worth watching.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 23, 2024","It was mildly entertaining if you shut your brain off. However, we need to support movies that have good writing and original ideas. The success of franchises like this is why Hollywood operates the way that it does. These movies more money than they deserve. Don't give them any of yours.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 23, 2024","Felt like F&F's infinity war, They got there own avengers, They got what expendables want to become, Perfect Villains. Spot-on Cameos and amazing plot points left to explore further, each and every character and connection from previous movies feels natural and goddam they got whole old cast together with great new comers , Ending feels incomplete obviously.. but post credit was surprisingly awesome. Overall an Amazing movie.",POSITIVE
"Feb 23, 2024","Look no further for mediocre actors and a ridiculous plot. I saw this against my will, this franchise should have ended 10 years ago.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 22, 2024","As an action movie, absolutely OK. The stunts and effects are amazing. Really really good actually!! But the music sucks - big time - as always!! - And has that in all films. And now the story is getting really watered down and thin! Doesn't hold much of value or interest or substance anymore - despite the cast with some good and celebrity actors and sadly others who should have been fired before/after(?) movie 3! Oh, and the franchise was story-thin already by/after movie #2 - although they got a little boost in movies 6 and 7. Mostly thanks to the participation of Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham who are also in this one with Helen Mirren in a small role. Jason Momoa doesn't help Fast X one bit, sad to say. He overacts in a way that only Nicholas Cage can get away with - here it just gets hilariously pathetically bad!
They are past the time to scrap this series for good I think. Let it rest in peace please….
But there will be a part 2. Hopefully they end the whole franchise with it!",NEGATIVE
"Feb 22, 2024","In my opinion, Jason Momoa gives the worst performance in this franchise's history (and that is saying something!).",NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2024",O filme mais porcaria que já vi. Totalmente perdido sem nenhum foco. Todo mundo ajuda o Dominique sem motivo nenhum. Mais um filme porcaria do vin diesel,NEGATIVE
"Feb 17, 2024","FAST X is a solid entry in the franchise, featuring the same craziness that's become a trademark of the series. However, for the first time I can recall, it includes some more laid-back character-building moments, which add depth without the usual franchise melodrama or grandiosity. John Cena brings a much-needed comedic touch to the film, and it feels entirely natural. Jason Momoa also dives headfirst into his role, giving it his all and channeling a Vaas-like vibe (from Far Cry 3). However, due to a script flaw, his character lacks a stronger motivation, making his actions feel somewhat extreme and senseless. The rest of the cast delivers their usual performances, staying true to their characters. What's lacking in this film is the creativity in Dom's storyline, and Vin Diesel's effort in portraying him. Dom once again plays the role of the family patriarch who must make sacrifices to save everyone, even though it's a recycled plot from previous films. Nonetheless, it serves as a good plot device for advancing the story and allowing other characters to shine. Overall, FAST X delivers some genuinely funny moments and doesn't disappoint in the action department, featuring some of the craziest sequences yet.",POSITIVE

"Feb 13, 2024","Was hesitant at first glance but this was one of the best films I'd seen since returning to theaters, when you realize a movie is supposed to be crazy, emotional and entertaining thats what this film gives you from start to finish.

"Feb 11, 2024","so painfully awful and bad...like torture 2 your brain with cgi computerized crash after crash after crash...so awful, but another 1 is coming in 2 years",NEGATIVE
"Feb 10, 2024","After the disappointing over-the-top antics of the previous film, FAST X is a welcome return to form for the franchise. The self-seriousness of Dom and company is as funny as ever, and the film's actual humor works well too. The F&F series has always excelled at elevating the car chase to a kind of visual poetry, and FAST X impressively achieves the difficult balance of human-centered and kinetic vehicular action. The use of big-budget practical effects further distinguishes the film from the all-too-common CGI spectacle of other blockbusters. Jason Momoa is terrible/perfect as the flamboyant villain, and the story's skillful connection to earlier installments sets the stage for a fitting eventual end to the saga.",POSITIVE
"Feb 10, 2024","Easily the worst big budget film I have ever seen. Writing was like someone was huffing glue while watching Transformers and Batman. Vin Diesel does the worst acting i've ever seen in my life. The best part was Jason Mamoa, at least he recognized he was in a meme and played to it. Fast Franchise officially more cringe than Transformers, shameful. I am glad I did not pay to see it in theaters.",NEGATIVE

Kudos to everyone involved in the making of such an exciting movie.",POSITIVE
"Feb 6, 2024",The movie is full of stupid elements and it makes it very difficult to suspend disbelief. Some of the CGI is bad enough to distract from the action. Why watch a car chase movie when the car is CGI? The plot is also very underwhelming.,NEGATIVE
"Feb 4, 2024","I really wanted to like this movie, but, man, if I hear Vin say ""family"" one more time I'm gonna hurl.

"Feb 3, 2024","Okay, it starts with action which is maintained throughout the movie. But really? Who lives like this? The acting is pretty bad and the bomb? Oh yes there's a bomb which I guess any bad guy can buy and load on the back of a truck at his whim. Well, it rolled all over Rome on fire and no explosion. Oh, I'm sorry, there's the incredible Dom, the hero! Dom uses his fabulous car to put the bomb in the water because well, he's Dom. Only he can save the Vatican.  It's a very silly, ridiculous movie that can't be saved even with the amazing cast. Okay, Jason Momoa gives great villain face, and he is funny. The dialogues are all stupid because the lines and scenes are contrived and nonsensical.  My goodness all those angry, psychotic faces! Lots of scowling to show their fury!!!! John Cena and Dom's son flying in a little surfboard plane fueled by Smirnoff vodka that was unloaded from a plane several thousand feet in the sky? Really? The music when Dom picks up Brie Larson when she got shot and puts her in the car! Touching? Nope. Corny as hell.  Tyrese and Luda bonding over leadership? I wanted to projectile hurl. No, really. The movie is campy and if you have a couple of hours of your life to spare and you want to watch something totally unbelievable, asinine and has no cinematic merit, get your snacks, your girl or your man and something to put you in the atmosphere like a lot of wine or weed. Remember, those are hours of your life you cannot get back. Oops I'm sorry, parents.

Then, I am all for a popcorn movie and being over the top but this even pushed my limit. AND...there is no ending! I wasted over 2 hours and there are so many loose ends! So unsatisfying!

I expect a franchise with such good names in it to deliver a good / solid story, great action (at least some times) and leave me wanting more. 
It would have been better to do a stand alone film, rather than the rumoured trilogy (I honestly cannot see this happening and currently would be surprised to see the next one in April 2025 - it was rumoured to be due out then). 
However, that all said, some of it was very good for example the overall story idea, some of the fight scenes (the first one with C Theron is very good), some of the action hits the spot (Rome) and the  development of J Cenas Jacob is quite sweet. I was quite frankly sick of seeing J Mamoa, A Ritchson, B Larson (no fault of their own, just dial it down writers!) and would be interested to see Dom gone, because of the dynamics between the characters. A lot of it was also unnecessary and that meant at times it was slow. Having a sequel so far after, when so much is left in the air, is also pretty frustrating. This is a film that is good in the background and pay attention at the exciting bits.",NEGATIVE

The agonising script of (what felt like) recycled cheesy action movie one liners, biffed in a blender with utterly impossible stunts, made me think this must have been written by an AI robot.

The family themselves and the supporting characters were spot on for a first time watch and Jason Mamoa was a spectacular and fun villain. This movie was a great film to start 2024 and I'm now more excited to see the other entries. Can't wait to see part 2 of the film",POSITIVE

It is a long way (light years) from the original movie and is a total load of, mmmmmmm nothingness. 
I wonder if there is any real acting work available in hollywood

Minha opinião: Uns dizem que será uma triologia e outros em duas partes. Mas pelo que sabemos ela esta para terminar. Será? Um filme que sempre ressucita dos mortos. Kkk. Velozes e Furiosos criou um universo único, despertou em muitos o drifty, os carros mexidos, e os rachas. Despertou em uma legião de seguidores dentro e fora das telas. Um filme que sempre inspira a família. Comcerteza algo que marcou foi a perda de Paul Walker. Neste filme não temos carros indo para o espaço, mas aquelas cenas forçadas tem aqui também. Aqui temos Jason Momoa como o grande inimigo da saga e sendo ele o maior. A cada filme aparece um maior que o outro. Mas será que veremos Momoa depois virando a casaca para a família? Se terminar os Velozes aí não veremos mas se continuar, podemos né. Jason Stathan, John Cena, The Rock, e quem sabe com Charlize também. Aqui temos Jason como filho do traficante brasileiro Rayes que foi morto em Velozes 5 e que agora ele vem para vingar. E para isso ele quer a morte do filho de Don é o alvo. E o filme passa por Roma, Rio, Portugal,.... E toda a família é envolvida e Don precisará de ajuda de novas pessoas. Com várias cenas eletrizante e forçadas, enche o tempo de pura adrenalina. Temos aqui os papeis dos atores como de sempre os mesmos e os diferentes são as novas caras: Brie, Alan, Jason, Eastwood,....
Roteiro e enredo Fazem da mesma receita com atores e situações diferentes, mas da mesma receita. Desde o fim do Mundo, aqui mudou para vingança.
Vale apena assistir? Para quem é fã e já sabe oque vai encontrar.

"Dec 25, 2023","🇮🇹Fast X è il primo film della trilogia finale della saga di Fast and Furious. Il film fa riferimento al finale di Fast and Furious 5 per trarre, molto probabilmente, il villain più potente della saga che mette in estrema difficoltà i protagonisti. La trama si svolge all'interno delle maggiori città europee e negli States e segue (più o meno) lo stesso filone narrativo che presenta ogni Fast, in quanto porta la divisione dei protagonisti in piccoli gruppetti, i quali poi tentano di ricongiungersi. È un film molto movimentato ma devo dire che non si parte proprio bene. Sono un fan della saga e devo ammettere che se il livello si mantiene così, lo accetto in quanto questi film vanno visti come puro e solo intrattenimento, ma non posso esimermi dall' esaminarlo in quello che è, un film mediocre ma ""salvato"" da un ottimo cliffhanger e una grande scena mid-credit, che apre ottime possibilità per gli ultimi due film della saga. I problemi più giganteschi sono il montaggio terribile della prima parte del film, in quanto le scene sembrano incollate una sopra l'altra senza un motivo logico, inoltre si gioca troppo sulla sospensione dell'incredulità, perché ci sono troppe dinamiche irrealistiche che ti fanno pensare a delle situazioni piuttosto ""tamarre"" e senza senso, le quali erano presenti anche negli altri Fast, ma in questo si sfiora veramente il limite. Le uniche cose buone che si salvano dal film sono l'ottimo sviluppo del villain, poiché risulta veramente odioso, svolgendo quindi correttamente il suo obiettivo incutendo abbastanza timore, in quanto si capisce come sia la maggiore minaccia che la squadra abbia mai affrontato e le performance degli attori abbastanza buone. In definitiva un film che ameranno tutti i fan della saga ma che oggettivamente presenta giganteschi difetti, i quali superano di gran lunga i pregi. Ritengo che da fan, posso dire che comunque è un film che fa godere e che ti fa rimanere a bocca aperta, ma oggettivamente, da un punto di vista cinematografico è veramente di scarsa qualità. ———————————————————————————- 
🇬🇧 Fast X is the first film in the final trilogy of the Fast and Furious saga. The film refers to the finale of Fast and Furious 5 to draw, most likely, the most powerful villain of the saga that puts the protagonists in extreme difficulty. The plot takes place within the major European cities and in the States and follows (more or less) the same narrative thread that presents each Fast, as it brings the division of the protagonists into small groups, which then try to reunite. It's a very eventful movie but I have to say that it doesn't start very well. I am a fan of the saga and I must admit that if the level stays that way, I accept it as these films should be seen as pure and only entertainment, but I can not fail to examine it in what it is, a mediocre film but ""saved"" by an excellent cliffhanger and a great mid-credit scene, which opens up very good possibilities for the last two films. The most gigantic problems are the terrible editing of the first part of the film, as the scenes seem glued on top of each other without a logical reason, moreover you play too much on the suspension of disbelief, because there are too many unrealistic dynamics that make you think of rather ""crazy"" and meaningless situations, which were also present in the other Fasts, but in this they really touch the limit. The only good things that are saved from the film are the excellent development of the villain, as it is really obnoxious, therefore correctly carrying out his goal with enough fear, as it is understood how it is the greatest threat that the team has ever faced and the performances of the actors quite good. Ultimately a film that all fans of the saga will love but that objectively has gigantic flaws, which far exceed the merits. I think that as a fan, I can say that in any case it is a film that makes you enjoy and that makes you feel amazed, but objectively, from a cinematographic point of view it is really of poor quality.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","I have never liked this film franchise, but I've never had so much despise for a film and yet leave itself on a cliffhanger, one that I have no interest in seeing where the story goes.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Great all star movie... Enchanting.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","This is the worst film I've ever seen in the franchise.  Thank god I didn't go to the cinema to watch this. This shows Jason Mamoa can't act camp, the story line is really horrible,  the screenplay is pathetic.  This franchise needs to stop now.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",I feel like this movie was a big upgrade from fast 9. Momoa did a great job and movie felt like something new and fancy. It is a great action movie and the only bad thing is that it wasn't the last movie off the franchise.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Vehicle action on roidz 👍😍
Cast exceptionally grand... Paul Walker cameo was a Kleenex moment 😭",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",The Movies was good and the action was great by Jason Momoa playing the villain was a wrong choice for the movie. Don't get me wrong Jason Momoa is a great actor but not on Fast X. Jason Momoa was Terrible as a Villain in Fast X. They could have done better with a different actor as the Main Villain cause Jason Momoa was terrible in Fast X.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 16, 2023",Jason is a quite crazy and good villain. He was a good choice. But the whole movie... well I found it boring except the end where Dwayne showed up. I miss Hobbs & Shaw scenes.,POSITIVE

"Dec 6, 2023","""Fast X"" zooms onto the screen with a tire-screeching start, delivering an electrifying love letter to the Fast and Furious saga. Visually, it's a turbocharged masterpiece, boasting jaw-dropping shots that amp up the adrenaline. The film embraces its classic over-the-top action, urging audiences to buckle up and simply savor the ride without overthinking. The stakes soar sky-high, signaling the beginning of the end for the franchise, injecting a thrilling urgency into every scene.

Jason Momoa emerges as the shining star, easily claiming the title of the franchise's best villain. His portrayal is a perfect blend of intimidating and uproariously funny, stealing every scene he graces. John Cena's subplot as Dom's charming brother adds a hilarious dynamic to the family-driven narrative, while Vin Diesel unfortunately falls short once again in the acting department.

The film's Achilles' heel lies in its overstuffed ensemble and multitude of subplots, resulting in an excessive runtime. However, amidst the chaos, ""Fast X"" manages to entertain with its high-octane action, humor, and the promise of an epic closure to the saga. Buckle in, suspend disbelief, and relish the frenzy—it's a rollercoaster you won't want to miss!",NEUTRAL

"Dec 1, 2023","Goes to show happens when you get it really wrong. It tried hard to be a comedy and falls flat on its face, it was too lazy to fall its arse. Relies on trying to rehash an old storyline, not sure if they ran out of money for scrip writers with any understanding of the franchise or any talent or both. Will not be rushing to see what else they can vomit out for Fast 11",NEGATIVE

"Nov 25, 2023","It's time for the Fast Franchise to end! It's been a long, wild, and whacky ride for the Fast and Furious Franchise but I think it has finally outstayed it's welcome. Where the first 3 or 4 Fast movies were a little grounded with realism, this latest entry is just completely off of the rails. Yes, I understand this is a film where you turn your mind off and just enjoy the action but c'mon! The plot in Fast X is so far fetched and the action set pieces just ignore all laws of gravity, that it's really hard to enjoy this film. Vin Diesel even seems to be phoning it in here. The only one who seems to understand the assignment is the newest Villian played by Jason Momoa who is absolutely ridiculous in a good way. Jason seemed to channel his Heath Ledger knock off impersenation here and for the most part it works. Also please be original and stop retconning events, it comes off being lazy. How this movie ends spells out that there will be another Fast film but why?! Hasn't 10 entries been enough already?! Fast X gets 2 low X's out of 5 from me.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 24, 2023","How can any adult watch this movie and walk away thinking ""man, that was good!""?  I really think that this movie was written by AI because I'm pretty sure it used every action movie trope ever conceived by a Hollywood writer, even when it didn't make sense to use it.  As an example, there's a scene where Dom ""discovers"" the bad guy's lair.  *Cue melodramatic music* *Zoom in on Dom's face, twisted into a stupid look of intrigue* ""This is where I'll find my answers!"".  Nevermind that he knows who the bad guy is and why he's coming after him.  What exactly is the question here, Dom!?  

Every action movie cliche ever devised?  Done to death.
Every line of dialogue written?  Stupid.
Every line of dialogue delivered?  Wooden.
Every joke?  Groan worthy. 
Every scene with Jason Momoa in it?  Chewed.

Then there's the repetition...Jason Momoa somehow magically finds a lookout spot that can oversee the whole city from every angle (they try to explain this away by giving him a screen with a few cameras on it) and SHOCK!  He's magnetically attached an explosive to the bottom of a vehicle!  *Chaos ensues*

Just let this franchise die please.  As much as I love seeing Jason Statham continuing to find work, I just can't stomach another one of these truly god awful films.",NEGATIVE

"Nov 1, 2023","Special effects superior . Already established actors excellent scenery fantastic visiting all these countries nothing like it!! Jason Momoa well, his part needed further work and insight 
He came off more as the Joker in Batman and not at all as an original character   This was very disappointing as I feel his acting has improved a bit, his rhetoric was boring costume was great. I feel he should went in and out of his facade with a deep masculine dialect. He never came off as serious just a skipping stone across the waters of terrorism. This method of acting gave no pause or regard to the tragic sequences unfolding; one scene went into the other losing the intenseness it should have portrayed. Again it gave pause for a yawn. Too much in special effects without intense acting. Kept me wondering. Did this movie turn into a comedy when I blinked? As I am pondering this thought I lost control of the story line.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 31, 2023","Unrealistic poppycock — I hope I live 144 minutes longer so I can make up for the time this mindless drivel stole from me.  Innie Dieselbreath suuuuucks at acting; Jason Mamoa's performance was surprisingly good. I recommend skipping all the scenes without him.  All the ""good"" criminals are bulletproof and indestructible while the armoured vehicles and soldiers were made of papermashe.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 21, 2023","This was the most fun of the Fast movies by far! Yea, some of it was predictable, and some of the effects were noticeable but I LOVED it! The acting was awesome, I laughed, gasped, jumped, cheered and hid behind my hands. So great, can't wait for the next, and also so sad they're talking about ending the series. Solid movie.

Para falar a verdade, não é um filme ruim, só a história é precária, e o final sem sentido e acabando de uma forma rápida, sabe?

"Oct 8, 2023","Sadly, the time has come for this franchise. It's been on the horizon for awhile, but the action is now wildly overshadowed by the bad jokes and high cheese acting. Jason Momoa is unbelievable and laughable at best. Alan Ritchson is a C level soap opera actor. Even the Vin Diesel charm was mischaracterized and lost! And can we stop this garbage storyline of Brian being safe ""somewhere""? Ten is definitely the end for this franchise and sadly it will not go out on a good note.",NEGATIVE

One of the better fast movies had 0 of the original cast like Tokyo drift.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 7, 2023","+ First action sequence with the bomb rolling through the Vatican is great.
+ Unlike F9, this movie leaned into Cena being hilarious and benefited from it. 
+ At least there is only one more, or so we are told. 
+ Momoa is probably the best villain of the Fast franchise. He is at least unique, whereas all the other Fast villains blend together into an amorphous tech guru evil genius.

- Brie Larson is painfully bad, and it is really hard to stand out for bad acting in a Fast movie. 
- The Cena and Little B scene on the plane was a special kind of stupid. 
- The ""who are you going to choose"" scenes make zero sense. Terrible rehashing of the Nolan Batman theme. 
- Cena... spoiler here... died by turning the rocket thrusters down, jumping a median, and killing a bowling pin setup of baddies? Why? How does this meaningfully help Dom get away?",NEUTRAL

"Sep 24, 2023","What a joke of a film. This series becomes more ridiculous with each outing. Subpar special effects and terrible acting. The writing is crap one-liner after another and seem like they were written by middle schoolers. All common sense and rules of gravity are ignored. The good guy's cars can fall from deadly distances or survive multiple crashes that incapacitate or explode every other car. Death doesn't matter because any character can just reappear whenever like magic. Rail-thin women can suddenly overcome trained and armed secret agents or top tier mercenaries with ease. Since they went to space already, my guess is in the next inevitable sequel they go and fight Cthulhu or drag race Jesus for Dom's dad to come back to life. And Dwayne calls him a ""sumbitch"" while either covered in sweat or spitting, because he has to say that in every movie, like the sad, one dimensional character he is.",NEGATIVE

Jason Mamoa plays a pretty good villain, but the movie is still pretty dumb lol. I know it's been that way for the past few movies, but that still doesn't excuse it. My main negative is just that I can't stand them bringing back dead characters. With Han from F9, and now Gal Gadots character in this one. It ruins there death scenes from previous movies, but also it ruins any potential deaths in this movie and moving forward. Why should I be invested in these characters when I know they'll always survive. That aside, Fast X is fine. If u liked the previous ones u should enjoy this one too.",NEUTRAL

"Sep 20, 2023","This was the height of ridiculousness. They retconned the plot and tied it in to the best movie of the franchise, and brought back like every character who's ever been in one of these things. The best performance is probably Mamoa, and everyone else is just taking a check (maybe Ritchson is pretty good). Captain Marvel sucked in this, Groot wore makeup to look younger, and even Charlize is just daydreaming through this. I really had no clue WTF was even happening most of the time. It was definitely better than the last movie, but I just felt it was overstuffed and pretty stupid by the end. And like half the scenes Mamoa is in, he just stands there with his arms out waiting for some shit to explode. Bigger isn't always better, and this movie is also totally racist. Mamoa is not a Latino, and they mispronounce every Latino word or name-""Hernan,"" ""Maduros,"" etc...quality over quantity woulda been better.",NEGATIVE

"Sep 18, 2023","FF movie series has that magic formula where the characters and action are ones you always enjoy.  This one was not as close knit as they were separated.  There is also some fun cameos but not sure why or how Brie Larsen wormed her way into the movie. 
Only other complaint is even though  Jason Momoa acted his parts well,  it was random after the intro younger silent revenge face scene to different scenes later in the movie where he is almost like a mix of his flamboyant character in Slumberland and a bit Joker-esque as others have said.  I assumed it was just him going insane with his mission to make Dom suffer...but it wouldve been better if they build up storyline to his insanity.  It felt like ax totally different character from beginning (or newly inserted FF 5 scene).
I always seem to enjoy this low substance FF series still.  I don't expect anything as usual and will enjoy Fast and Furious as the always over the top on action packed physics defying sci-fi spy vehicle mayhem movie with a touch of  ""family"".   
Action will still never disappoint no matter how much fans and audience think this is one is better or worse than the others in the series.",NEGATIVE

I'll Google how 11 ends because I can't see myself sitting through another one of these. I do like that they avoided politics in today's age - props on that.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 17, 2023","First off, I loved all the cameos, kind of made the (hopefully) end of this franchise better. Jason Momoa while pleasant to look at and started out, really interesting and funny, ended up being preachy and just eye rolling BAD. The stunts are too much CGI, the audience is only going to let so much go before it's just comical and stupid. Vin Diesel picking up a car and THROWING 6'5 Momoa around? Vin Diesel driving down a dam in FLAMES..again. Besides the blaring obvious Vin Diesel being in love with his own character and his own ego, Paul Walker wanted this franchise to stop at 6, and it should have. This format is tired, the actors LOOK tired of playing these characters and if I have to hear Vin Diesel say or act upon the word "" family"" one more time I may vomit.

"Sep 16, 2023","Only an hour into the movie thus far but, it has been really good. So the scene where han and roman make comparison about penis? lol because the angry birds measured that one limp pic 7.5, but gets 8.25"" erect. ""going up against a v10, but the alfa is better on these streets."" Lol as one of my best and only chiese friends from psu would say. It's all about finesse. Or as I'd like to say ""If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration."". ― Nikola Tesla. Applies to females for sure. Also, I hope the actors and film studio don't mind but I am posting that true statement to tiktok.

"Sep 16, 2023","The Fast X movie suffers from an overwhelming amount of content, leading me to a cross between feelings of fatigue and boredom. The reliance on elements from the previous nine Fast movies results in a lack of originality, making the film predictable. The excessive use of special effects, taking up 90% of the film, detracts from the overall experience and feels excessive. Less is sometimes more.The portrayal of the villain, played by Jason Mamoa, is overly exaggerated and overacted, which hampers the believability of the character. A particular scene involving the painting of dead men's toenails deems repulsive and unnecessary, adding nothing to the plot. We get it, Mamoa's character is deranged. The editing of the movie is subpar, failing to effectively manage the content and resulting in a disjointed viewing experience. The absence of a proper ending, replaced by a cliffhanger, is disappointing and feels like a cheap tactic to lure audiences back for another installment. The film also featured too many characters and resurrected deceased ones from previous Fast franchises, which can be confusing and dilutes the impact of their previous exits. The writer responsible for this storyline should be held accountable and not given further opportunities to write for the franchise.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 16, 2023","Usually these movies are great in their ability to entertain with fast cars and silly action. That being said, trying to add so many names, brought it down quite a bit. Jason Momoas performance was horrible, he's already an average actor at best, but this performance was so bad. Brie Larson was another failure. The cars as usual were cool, the action scenes were mostly good, some of the fight scenes were so unbelievable and weak. John Cena was ok, but didn't add much. Overall it was one of the worst in the series... I hope they let this series die already, it is way past its prime.",NEGATIVE

"Sep 9, 2023","I am a big fan of the franchise. If this was in fact the last movie, I did not like the ending or the fact that the villain was always 10 steps ahead of everyone with a seemingly endless supply of tech and resources that rivaled that of the old westerns and their endless supply of bullets, in a gun fight.  
I liked seeing everyone again, even the trailer at the end was good and would lead someone to believe there is an opportunity for a side story. 
Based on the old characters reappearing, it made me realize, there are 10 movies and I may have to go back and watch them to follow all the bouncing balls.

"Sep 4, 2023",The script needs more work. The villain is not convincing. They probably should have ended it years ago. They will probably never stop making these movies. It was an ok movie.,NEGATIVE
"Sep 4, 2023","While the cast line up is great unfortunately the cars (not the action scenes) were the best part of the movie along with the fight scenes. So much unrealistic events go on in this movie. Jason momoa's Dante was the most realistic. He wasn't too over the top and did a good part portraying a new villain with a twist. Not the same old bad guy that's mean and strong. Although, I would have loved there to be a fight scene with Dante whooping Dom, then maybe the other way in part 2 of fast X. Anyways the special effects felt fake. The script is predictable from scene to scene. And my God the cheesy one liners / "" fast quotes"".  Glad I didn't spend money in the theater for this one. Good job to Jason Momoa keeping it real and original. Vin and the rest I'm sorry but could have been alot better. Maybe next time for part 2.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 29, 2023","Fast X - 4.5/10. Okay, so I'm obviously not the target audience for these movies. But, I still gave it a shot (considering this is a 2 parter turned 3 parter finale). And oh boy, is this movie a hilariously bonkers film. Fast X is, shall I put it lightly, an over the top extravaganza of the highest order. I didn't mind the gravity and physics defying stuff. I expect that. What I wasn't expecting was how much lower the acting, writing, and dialogue delivery would get. How hilariously bad it all was. Sheesh.

"Aug 18, 2023","These films used to be dumb, stupid fun. This one is just dumb. After watching this I immediately went to check if they had any reshoots or creative issues and sure enough they changed the director from the previous films and rewrote the script. It shows. The plot is so full of holes it's unbelievable: how do you accept a job from a top secret agency, said agency isn't aware of any job and nobody can contact you. Dom and Letti leave days after his crew has already left but still arrive on the day of the heist. Minimal if any casualties in Rome. Dom and Elena's kid doesn't look like either of them and doesn't look like the baby used in the previous film. Why would Cena make a vehicle where the gun turrets are able to face down and still fire? Why is Bri Larson carrying God's Eye in her pocket instead of hiding it away safely? How do you sneak up on Dom and company in a freaking helicopter? How does Reyes hack and steal all their money with Tej and Ramsey(The creator of God's Eye) there. Then you have Dom's Crew acting totally out of character. Everyone wants to be a badass. You have Tej flipping bad guys and Ramsey beating up guys in body armor. Bro Larson beating up a bar full of grown ass men. I mean cmon. Tyreses' character change is mind boggling. They made him look incompetent and he was insufferable in every scene. The moneybag gag was terrible and none of his jokes landed. Cena now plays himself instead of Dom's brother like in Fast 9 and even has a 'You can't see me' moment. Then there's bad writing and continuity issues. God's Eye is the MacGuffin again. Dom is having a teary eyed moment thinking about Brian(Paul Walker) while Charlie Puth is playing in the background even though Brian is still alive in the movie. Shaw starts fighting with Han even though their issues were supposed to be resolved previously. They sidelined the brilliantly evil Cypher for Reyes who is way too over the top. Reyes is supposed to be some Joker-esque type villain but for the most part is just downright creepy. And how exactly do they prepare us for all his insanity? His father mentions that he's crazy in passing at the start of the film. The guy introduced is not the insane guy we eventually see. Reyes also doesn't connect as the villain cos he's basically shoehorned into the film using old scenes. He's a random nobody who gets knocked off a bridge and his plight is not justified. Hobbs killed his dad and that's why him going after Dom feels so empty. The action pieces were done before and are underwhelming. As if that's not bad enough you have the characters seriously commenting on the insane stuff they did in a previous scene. Just pure cringe. I'm not sure how Vin allowed this but the magic is gone. It's like they took every theme, meme and every trope from the previous films and crammed them into this film just for the feels. They even reuse old sets. In the end I don't know how a sequel or two is gonna redeem this.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 17, 2023","This is seriously a must watch in the theatre. Good, old style, classical action flick.",POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2023",From the first episode to fast x is still so good,POSITIVE
"Aug 14, 2023","It has a good cast, a good scenario but the story ends up differing from the biggest focus of people that would be to see the cars  if the saga of the movie was just action, it would be good, but currently the movies  have a bad stories with few car scenes which is the main aspect that people want to see",NEGATIVE
"Aug 14, 2023","I don't know if it allowed here to compare movies, but watching Mission: Impossible and Fast X at the same time makes me compare in my mind, there is no even way to put those movies together, Fast X pushes you to the edge of telling you ""this is fake"", in the other hand Mission: Impossible is always making you believe that this can really happen, every action scene in Mission: Impossible is created to give you this impression, but Fast X is .. really very bad movie",NEGATIVE
"Aug 14, 2023",It's bad don't watching.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","I've read quite a few mixed reviews on this installment of the franchise.  At this point, you should know what you're getting in to.  I think X is better than Fast 9, and I enjoyed the many callbacks to previous films.  The addition of new characters, as well as seeing some of the regulars grow a bit is welcomed.  Naturally there's action: great cars/motorcycles/trucks/planes/etc., fight scenes, music, and a visually stunning film.  

I'm a fan of the franchise, and I was not disappointed, seeing it twice on the big screen, and just receiving the DVD and going through the extra features (which are great).",POSITIVE

"Aug 11, 2023","As crazy and outlandish as the last few movies were, and I didn't care much for them, this one is at least 100x worse. The fact that it's rated over half a star, and over 20% just shows you how much of a hold the industry has over the reviews. People have to be paid off to acknowledge this movie as anything other than pure trash, and I like awful and trashy movies, but not this one. Everything about it is way over done, the forced comedy is atrocious, and the casting is REALLY bad even though no cast could've saved this cesspool of crap!

"Aug 9, 2023","Besides some very dumb parts of the plot this was actually one of the best action movies i've seen in a while. It has the best emotional moments since Fast 5 and Furious 7. I liked that the whole movie the team is separated in groups so you'll be much happier when they reunite for the final fight especially now with Gisele, Hobbs and most likely with Brian! I'm pretty sure they will bring him back with the help of Cody Walker, CGI and AI. This movie is literally all about family (Reyes Family) (Doms Family) (Elenas Sister) (Mr. Nobody's Daughter). The CGI was very bad at some moments and physics didn't exist! BUT i really hope the next one is the final movie because i can't see how they could do 2 more..",POSITIVE

"Aug 9, 2023","Dominique Toretto is back and his family. This time his team is sent on a mission in Rome, but it is a trap. Someone has set them up. There is a bomb, and car chases all over Rome. Cars are crashing, exploding, burning up. Rome is a mess.

  ""I am the man thats going to break your family, piece by piece"" - Dante
   Now everyone that Dom has ever cared about is in danger. Even Dom's enemies must become his allies. Dante will not stop. He is coming for everyone.
  ""The devil's coming"" - Cipher
    Fast X story is a bit choppy and all over the place and mostly repetitive and predictable. Actually it just looks like a bunch of random scenes put together with no real story. Oh and so many awesome actors with absolutely nothing to do. Then suddenly the movie just kind of ends with no warning?? That was strange. 

    But this is the Fast and Furious and so there is  lots and lots of car chases, lots of cameos and unbelievable and somewhat ridiculous car stunts and crashes.... And there is also Jason Momoa doing his best Joker.  A bit too much for me.     
    So what has happened to my Fast and Furious? I think I will go back and watch the original and forget I even watch this one.

"Aug 9, 2023","It would be half a star, but seeing Han again was cool and Jason manias character was a proper villain.
The issue with this movie is that none of it's believable. The car scenes are awful, the action scenes are a bit lackluster, and even the CGI work looks pretty bad. Hard to believe the budget on this film couldn't afford better.

I'm a long time fan, I really wanted to like this film. Parts of it were great. But a LOT of it was terrible.
I miss the old fast and furious movies, with ridiculous body kits and neon lights, without all the super spy moves and seemingly unlimited explosions and celebrity cameos.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Fast X is a little better than some of the previous entries of the series that weren't good. But that doesn't mean Fast X is a great film overall, nor does it overshadow any of the greater films within the Fast saga. The story is outlandish despite having one good new addition with Jason Mamoa's character, and the rest of the cast play their parts just fine. The action is good if you're willing to go along with the crazy ride, but it still won't be for everyone who hasn't invested themselves in this series. As the first part of a promised finale, it would've been nicer to have a more solid conclusion to the film rather than a cliffhanger for the next sequel. Things just end abruptly and leave everyone hanging. The unfortunate truth is that if you didn't enjoy what you get in Fast X, you might not be coming back for the next one to see how it all ends.",NEUTRAL

The Fast and Furious Franchise took a nose-dive with its 10th installment. Despite decent performances from the usual cast, and a surprisingly good turn by Jason Momoa as the villian, this was just awful. I felt like I was watching a parody film. The action sequences and stunts were cartoonish, exaggerated  beyond any ability to suspend disbelief. The cliffhanger ending was unexpected, and acutally kinda pissed me off. Rather than engendering a desire to know what comes next, I find myself indifferent. There is enough fan-service that long-time fans of the franchise will appreciate it, but still wont' like it.",NEGATIVE

So an action movie I would say about a 3.5 but as a fast and furious movie it was a one at most the only thing that made it a fast and furious movie was ""family"" the tiny bit of racing they did in Brazil.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","More of the same...

"Aug 1, 2023","The cast is great, as always. Vin Diesel, Jason Momoa, and the rest of the gang all give great performances. The stunts are some of the most insane I've ever seen in a movie, and they're executed with a lot of skill and creativity. The story is a bit convoluted, but it's still entertaining. There are a lot of twists and turns, and the stakes are high. Overall, Fast X is a great popcorn movie. it's a lot of fun to watch.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023",The motion is fabulous. And it's a classic series that,POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","Had a great time while watching this film but this film is comparable to Fast 9. Fast X is very predictable, too much plot going on. Some scenes doesn't even deserve to be in the film, it takes up too much time for the film. Dante was kind of a ""meh"", he talks too much. Dominic Toretto, once again, is a super-human with the power to bring character back to life.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 31, 2023","cuando vas a ver FAST X, vas a divertirte, a pasarla bien con tus amigos o familia, (opinion personal).Esta pelicula es muchisimo mejor que su antecesora, (Fast And Furious 9).

Esta pelicula me sorprendio mucho,
tiene muy buena accion.
muy buenos personajes.
el mejor villano de franquicia.
te la pasas bien viendola.
un muy buen elenco.
tiene muy buena trama comparada con las ultimas peliculas que han sacado.
y un final que te deja con ganas de ver la siguiente.

Lo unico malo que le encuentro a la pelicula.
(OPINION PERSONAL)
es el cgi.

Pero en si esta pelicula no es para ir a verla por la trama si no para divertirse, pasarla bien, etc

Al final de todo siempre vamos a decir, porque sacan tanta pelicula o que esta franquicia debio terminar en la 7 o entre otras cosas mas pero al final cuando ya acabe la franquicia, la vamos a extrañar.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Fast X is so awesome lots of racing ,action and humor . Not a big fan of the actor who plays the villain in it I preferred him better as aquaman . Its one of my top 5 favorite movies out of the series. It shows family ,morals ,trust ,respect ,honor and legacy in this movie throughout the entire movie . If you are a Fast and Furious movie buff like me and have seen the ones before this one then Id highly recommend it. The ending of the cliffhanger really leaves you on the edge of your seat. Im not a big fan of cliffhangers but it makes you wonder I'm this movie who died the son or dad ? Did the dad take the bullet for his family legacy or did the son and dad find his way out . Im ready for the second half of the movie to find out what happened next ?",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023",Fast X continues to give the people what they want in terms suspending disbelief.  The Reyes villain is one of the better foes in the entire series.  I will say bringing back characters that were believed to be dead is starting to get old.  I also they need to do something with the Brian character.  It makes no sense in this universe that he remains sidelined at this point.  They have got to do a better job explaining him being gone if they are not going kill the character off.,NEUTRAL

"Jul 29, 2023","Fast X takes you on a great ride with characters that you've known and loved for years. The action in this movie is what makes this movie and the whole franchise thrive currently. The ways the writers are able to come up with inventive and creative action sequences is insane. But there's so many issues with this movie when it comes to the generic story. The repetitive use of conflicts and tying the villains to someone from the family's past. It just feels redundant and lazy at this point. This movie does feel more grounded than the last movie but when it comes to logic. The movie is still silly, gimmicky, and makes Dom and his family seem invincible. This movie also continues to show that this franchise still has no stakes when it comes to the consequences of the characters actions. The threat in this movie isn't even felt by the end of this movie because of how logically ridiculous these movies have become. I think Jason Momoa as Dante is the standout character in this movie. He does bring stakes, but with this franchise, anyone can survive anything. But I do think his personality and the way he carries himself is what makes his character enjoyable and it seems like Momoa is just having fun in the role. Overall, this movie isn't one to take seriously, just to have some fun with some great cheesy action and familiar characters. C+",NEGATIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","This isn't a movie - it's a cartoon. The villan was funny enough, the rest was pretty painful to watch.

You know, where if a child decides to do an impossible jump from a moving supersonic jet and land on a train moving in the opposite direction, then CGI takes over and slows his path down and plots it so that he cannot fail.

Similarly, a car can be dropped by satellite, survive the landing with a little bounce before driving sideways up some stone steps with perfect control and carry on.

Similarly, if someone comes into your house and murders your whole family, when you corner them with your assault rifle - don't ever shoot. That would end the movie very quickly, as you MUST WAIT whilst they take advantage of frozen time and reveal their pre-planned response to this completely random occurance.

In short, I couldn't watch the movie exclusively - I was playing (and enjoying) a mobile game the entire time to make it bearable.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Fast X has finally gone too far. As I recall, people keep complaining that these movies are dumb, however, too often people dismiss the action charm and overcomplicated plots of crazy writers trying to show how smart they are. This time they really went too far.
Furthermore, they retell an old movie by adding scenes that didn't exist. Thus, once again, they were caught in a ""revenge plot"" and once again the family must unite to defeat evil. They literally revamped the plot the last 2-3 movies, but this time they got lazy!
So this was, overall, a very dull, uninteresting and boring disappointment, Fast  9 should have been the last one.

I'm not looking forward to sequels to this mess at all.
Português/Brasil:

Velozes e Furiosos X finalmente foi longe demais. Pelo que me lembro, as pessoas continuam reclamando que esses filmes são burros, no entanto, muitas vezes as pessoas descartam o charme da ação e os enredos supercomplicados de escritores malucos tentando mostrar o quão inteligentes eles são. Desta vez, eles realmente foram longe demais.
Ademais, eles recontam um filme antigo adicionando cenas que não existiam. Dessa forma, mais uma vez, eles foram pegos em uma ""trama de vingança"" e mais uma vez a família deve se unir para derrotar o mal. Eles literalmente reformularam o enredo dos últimos 2-3 filmes, mas desta vez ficaram preguiçosos!
Portanto esta foi, no geral, uma decepção muito chata, desinteressante e chata, o Velozes e Furiosos 9 deveria ter sido o último.

"Jul 20, 2023","Fast X is a fun time however lacks a true plot. Dom (Vin Diesel) is forced to confront his worst fear of losing his child when Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa),  who is ret-conned into Fast Five shows up to take revenge on Dom and extended family. That's it. Dom and his family spend the rest of the time running from and trying to outwit Dante to no avail. It does have one good twist at the end but if you look closer in the beginning, you can see it coming. Jason Mamoa is easily the best villain and best thing about this movie. The next best thing is Jakob (John Cena) and Little B's (Leo Abelo Perry) relationship. The action sequences are great, if not could be shortened to have some semblance of a plot. What I didn't expect is the the lack of chemistry between the long time cast members, specifically Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris). Their interactions felt forced and off whereas in previous installments their interactions were very funny. Overall a good popcorn summer movie, but I expected better.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 19, 2023","In a few words, we have the beginning of the end of the saga, and I have to say that, although it managed to entertain me and that I do believe that it is superior to its most recent predecessors, the film is a disaster that never knew what direction to take; if the course of explosive fun, or the one that develops a story where our characters are in danger. Jason Momoa as Dante Reyes is the highlight of the film, it is very fun to know his character; the action scenes are vibrant enough to keep one's attention; however, the movie becomes boring at times and so many things going on at the same time does not help it at all. I sincerely hope that in the future they manage to get back on track and be what they once were.",NEUTRAL

I love part 1, 3, 4, & 5 especially 3, but it’s no longer fun or exciting to watch. I’m tired of Roman and Teg not doing anything other than argue since F&F 4. Han is back for now reason at all.

"Jul 15, 2023",Went by quite fast full of over the top action which you always like to see. Story wise was basic i think but could potentially get better throughout the trilogy or sequal depending which route they go and make it make more sense. Was alot of chatacters that felt like glorified cameos that were not probally needed and new characters made for soul purpose of bringing a actor in but not necessarily help the story. Jason momoa was great for me he carried the whole film the way his character acted was great at some points i was routing for him. Was a good film and i enjoyed it but probally will make more senss story wise when next part comes out.,NEUTRAL

Fast X is just more of the same but worse than it's predecessors. Even the visual effects could be better. Any sense of realism has gone out the window. Perhaps if you're 10 years old you might enjoy the slow paced movie but if you are accustomed to a higher level of movies, pass on this one, it's a waste of time.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 15, 2023","Fast X, the latest installment in the long-running Fast and the Furious franchise, follows a predictable pattern that has become all too familiar. While it delivers on the adrenaline-pumping action sequences and high-octane car chases that fans have come to expect, it fails to offer anything fresh or innovative. Sadly, the film falls victim to the pitfalls of its own success, presenting yet another poorly written script that relies heavily on overblown heroism and lacks originality.

One of the major drawbacks of Fast X is its portrayal of the characters. The film's insistence on glorifying its human protagonists to superhuman levels has long since crossed the boundaries of believability. While the franchise has always embraced a certain level of suspension of disbelief, Fast X takes it to a whole new extreme. The characters are presented as invincible beings capable of escaping death-defying situations with ease, which ultimately disconnects the audience from any genuine sense of tension or excitement.

Moreover, the script of Fast X suffers from a severe lack of creativity. It seems as though the writers took the formula that has worked in the past and merely transplanted it into a new location. The plot feels recycled, lacking any compelling twists or unexpected turns. There's an undeniable sense of déjà vu as the characters embark on another mission involving fast cars, international criminals, and high-stakes heists. It's disheartening to witness such a missed opportunity to inject new life into a franchise that desperately needs reinvention.

Fast X does manage to deliver on its promise of thrilling action sequences, with jaw-dropping car chases and explosive set pieces scattered throughout the film. However, even these adrenaline-fueled moments become repetitive after a while, as they follow a formulaic pattern that fails to offer any real surprises or memorable sequences.

In conclusion, Fast X represents a missed opportunity to revitalize a franchise that has become stagnant. Its poorly written script, overemphasis on heroism, and lack of originality make it yet another forgettable addition to the Fast and the Furious series. While fans of mindless action may find some enjoyment in the film's explosive moments, those seeking substance, innovation, and fresh storytelling will be left disappointed. It's high time for the franchise to hit the brakes and reevaluate its direction if it hopes to regain its former glory.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 15, 2023","Since they love bringing so many characters in this franchise back from the dead and all of them survive ridiculous things all the time, it gets tiresome. While it is pure nonsense, one can't deny that these movies do remain fun and entertaining though, I'll give it that. Some of the action sequences were good and I liked Jason Momoa as the villain, although not really his lines that he was given. It was clever that they made the muscular leader of the agency one of the accomplices in the end to the main bad guy too. I also really liked seeing Jason Statham again and Jakob with Dominic's son together. I feel like they could've made an entire movie out of those two and just their adventure! Part of me didn't like that they killed him off like they did but whatever, because there are a lot of things in this movie to dislike even more (the odd transitions, the weird scene with them in London and Han gets high off a muffin but in the next scene he's fine, the movie being rushed and all over the place with where they go so fast, and of course the physics). And did I even hear a Star Wars tie fighter sound effect when they went through a tunnel?? You can have enough of a good time with this movie like most of the others but at the same time, I'm getting bothered by how far they keep relentlessly pushing things and therefore there's really not that much suspense anymore or straightforward practicality...I mean for real, what can kill Dominic Toretto at this point?? It's a mixed bag for me.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 13, 2023","It's a well known fact that the previous two installments, The Fate of the Furious (2017) and F9: The Fast Saga (2021) didn't exactly hit their mark. Yes, the Fast & Furious franchise has always been self-aware, over-the-top crazy and fun, but the last two entries lacked the fun part, the Fast-family dynamic, and instead went on too far with the stunts that they looked so cartoonish and ridiculous. 

With Fast X, it's safe to say that the franchise is back to form, but it definitely suffers from having too many sub-plots and unnecessary characters.

The film cleverly connects the dots from previous movies, and the callbacks from Fast Five (2011), really help setting up Jason Mamoa's character Dante Reyes. Fast X is, without a doubt, a two-men show, where Vin Diesel and Jason Mamoa get to shine in their roles, while the rest of the cast members, on the other hand, get sidelined for the majority of the runtime, which is actually quite disappointing.

Mamoa truly steals the show, but it's obvious that his character has drawn inspiration from the DC Comics super villain Joker. Tyrese Gibson, Ludacis, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, who are fan favorites and allies of Dom, are barely in the half of the movie, while Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Charlize Theron and Jordana Brewster only appear in a couple of scenes. However, there are a couple of new likable additions to the cast who have the potential to become fan favorites in the future installments, such as Daniela Melchior, Leo Abelo Perry and Brie Larson. 

Compared to F9: The Fast Saga, where there were cartoonish stunt sequences such as cars flying to space, and swinging between trees and mountains (like Tarzan), Fast X has taken a little more subtle approach to its stunt sequences, but they are still fun, mindless and over-the-top, exactly like the fifth, sixth and seventh installments. 

The Fast & Furious franchise is also widely known for brining dead characters back to the later installments, which absolutely doesn't make any sense. It's like the core characters and the audience were mourning for nothing, and there was no point for seeking revenge in the previous films. Ever since Chris Morgan, who wrote the screenplay from The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Driff (2006) to The Fate of the Furious, got replaced with other writers, the franchise started to go downhill from there because the storytelling lacked the depth and creativity. 

Overall, Fast X is an improvement compared to The Fate of the Furious and F9, but still an average entry that doesn't quite live up to the best ones of the bunch; Fast Five, Furious 6 (2013) and Furious 7 (2015).",NEGATIVE

"Jul 12, 2023","Tired of the same old family theme, bad guys becoming good guys, characters coming back from the dead plots. 
However, Jason Momoa's character is what makes this movie fun.  He is fun, wicked and insane (although looks fat at times). His motive for revenge against the gang that robbed and murdered his father is justified, making me (and probably other audience)   root for him throughout the movie, and enjoy watching this villain (or is he an antihero?) kicking Toretto's butt.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 12, 2023","Pienso que estas peliuclas las están alargando bastante, hasta el punto donde puede que no hay una trama en especifico, o nueva en general, lo cual la hace muy repetitiva, o eso siento yo, pero el villano maníaco de Jason Momoa le da una sacudida a la franquicia.",POSITIVE

"Jul 10, 2023","I kinda liked this movie personally, but, I was very disappointed at the ending… I felt like the movie was missing something and It was too long, but somehow, was very fast paced, Which I genuinely hate. I like average-paced movies with an average runtime. I wouldn't have mind if the movie was longer but, at least, Make it average paced. The whole film felt like it was just action ON ACTION ON ACTION. At one point, I even fell asleep. But, Anyways, the action scenes were okay, I liked the some of the characters humors. But some, it was very cringey and hard to watch. Above all, THE ENDING IS SO BAD. Like, how did everyone just die? And also the cliffhanger and the random appearance of Gal Gadot made me felt like I wasted 12 dollars just to watch a pilot episode of an action TV show. A 2 AND A HALF HOUR ONE WITH THE WORST CLIFFHANGER I'VE SEEN IN HISTORY. So, yeah, I hope you enjoyed or hated my review. Be sure to stay safe. X.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 9, 2023","Felt like I paid all the money to say half of a movie, and nobody warned me beforehand. The worst thing is the half I saw was boring, predictable, self-righteous, devoid of any drama and not inventive at all.

Me personally, I am very disappointed, and not interested to see the other half, unless it's free or shown on my streaming channel.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 9, 2023","It was a great mix of cars and action, although, for me the franchise played out after the seventh movie and now it's mostly prolonging. For me Jason Momoa's casting was the greatest decision made for the movie. It was pretty decent given the circumstances of the whole franchise.",POSITIVE
"Jul 9, 2023",This movie was hilarious. A ridiculous Fast movie is ALWAYS a fun watch. Jason Momoa was really good in this in particular.,POSITIVE
"Jul 9, 2023","As the Fast and Furious franchise stands, it has progressively decreased in believability and overall entertainment. Straying too far from its roots as a series based on racing, Fast X is just another action movie that tries too hard to cater to a fantastical aspect of Mission Impossible. 
While it may carry itself as a high stakes, fast paced action movie - to which it does well - the convoluted criss-crossing of stories and the extensive list of associated characters make the movie more of a puzzle than it needs to be. 
Overall, Fast X was more of a Mission Impossible movie than a Fast and Furious movie.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 7, 2023","Yes, a lot of action, and the first part of the action sequence was borrowed from a previous movie.  I am sure that some writer throught it was great to include the action scene from a previous movie, as a flashback, fill-in section.  To me it was a cheap way to fill-in a movie time line, and saving money on the film.  In other words, action for cheap.  The plot seemed disjointed, and I DEFINITELY did NOT like the ending.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 6, 2023",It's not the fast and furious it used to be,NEGATIVE
"Jul 6, 2023","Love these movies, but I don't know that the 2 part format is best for this series. Felt stretched at times. Additionally, they need to address the Brian O'Conner situation. I understand the feelings and respect associated with Paul Walker, but the character deserves better than just being off screen. Brian would not sit on the sidelines, and his continued absence continues to degrade each sequel.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 6, 2023",Absolutely loved this movie!! Great from start to finish.,POSITIVE
"Jul 6, 2023",Hated 9 but loved 10. They brought the fun back and created a villain that is just too fun to watch. Over the top and crazy as expected but a true rollercoaster of a ride!,POSITIVE

"Jul 5, 2023",This film is good but this series has been overblown. Though it is a much better watch than fast 9 and relates back to previous films is a good story . There is definitely something missing from this film . Jason Mamoa is very unconvincing as a villain he's just not believable as a villain . His performance can best be described as a parody of Joaquin phoenixs joker. The rest of the film is great although this Franchise is tapped out and needs a break . Unfortunately with fast 11 and 12 already announced it's going to be a while before we get that break .,NEUTRAL

"Jul 4, 2023",These movies need a reboot of some kind.  It felt like watching 10 different scripts put together with tape…loose tape.   I love a good action movie and somethings that perhaps stretch reality but this is full of nonstop stunts that just defy physics to all degree.  Classic dodge chargers falling out of planes on to the street in mint condition as an example is almost comical..and its 2.5hrs of this kind of thing.  Have been a fan of the franchise…but at this point the story is played out.  Reboot. Rethink.  Lets Go.,NEGATIVE

"Jul 4, 2023","It is a trip down a memory lane of plot twist, cameos and callbacks to previous films, elevated mainly by Jason Momoa's crazy performance as the villain Dante out for revenge upon Dom and his ‘family'.

"Jul 4, 2023",Lots of great actors and actresses in the genre of this movie. Lots of action and excitement. Lots of believable action such as a young boy jumping from one car to another while the cars are spinning at high speed. Who could not like this high action packed movie.,POSITIVE

Oooo I'm vin diesel I'm going to walk around flexing the entire movie with my fists balled up and mention family one thousand times with terrible flash backs. This movie was so bad, not even getting all these decent/ good actors in the movie could make it better. Seriously though when did EVERYONE LEARN TO FIGHT NOW?! I mean seriously every single person can beat up trained mercenaries?! What the f**k is that?! None of the story line is convincible at this point it's all just random B.S. Long story short this movie is terrible and your ""family"" shouldn't waste their time watching it.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 2, 2023","I understand the ""fast"" franchise is about mindless action but if the narrative itself and written is bad then it can really become unwatchable.

"Jul 2, 2023",It was a decent Fast installment. Lots of action to keep you entertained and Vin and the rest of the crew did their thing well. The one thing I couldn't stand about the movie was Jason Momoa and his over the top flamboyance. Just felt like too much and extremely off-putting. I thought John Cena would go down as the worst character in the franchise but Cena was almost a breath of fresh air compared to Momoa. Momoa is corny and cringe throughout the movie.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 2, 2023","It's electrifying! The cliffhanger ending was a great move, it leaves you craving for more of the action. I was tired of the Fast franchise ending the same way ""family BBQs"". I can't wait for the last one next year!!!",POSITIVE

"Jun 30, 2023",This movie was amazing fantastic I mean I heard lot of miss feeling about this movies to fans but I was shocked how good of villain Jason Momoa was I was surprised to see him take role of fantastic villain one of tough bad guys for Toretto team put a lot of effort in this movie I will say this you might not agree with me on this but this my opinion there where some family parts but not as much family time than last time but a lot of racing this movie but they where trying to keep Brian safe although Jacob Toretto isn't out of woods yet but I am not so sure he dead because Han was able to be saved by mr Nobody but we will not know if mr nobody's saved Jacob when he was driving the Cannon car this a possibility he was able to kick the door open jumped out jumped in one of mr nobody getaway cars he might be in safe house somewhere or with mr nobody to try and get the CIA to be on Toretto crew side but also try to get rid of that police guy who sadly turn his back because I didn't see this in movie but Dom Toretto said is last words before the movie ended that he forgot about one thing his car which makes me believe Dom Toretto has kept his electric muscle car a secret but I could be wrong about Jakob it could happened or he is confirmed dead but we will see if he pops out in fast and furious 11 but I saw something twitter that they might split this final in to three parts which this franchise would get total of 12 movie which is to much I do agree should stop making this movies but if you think of its way to give all the actors more money plus extra movie because the producer asked Vin Diesel what will happened to Dominic Toretto character in future if they want to make fast X trilogy they should because if they already thinking of making Hobbs and Shaw 2 they should make 12 fast and furious movies because they brought Dwayne Johnson back to help bring down Jason Momoa. Which we need three movies because they won't be able to defeat Jason Momoa part 2 because now he has partner it will take at least three part finals to in order we all need to understand when Cipher was bad guy so if she had played villain for three movies so far than Jason Momoa villain should be equal amount of movies of being villain his character hasn't been villain so story hasn't ended up so I hope producer does decide to make three parts in my arrogant opinion that the actors need third movie because right now the screenwriter are having hard time getting paid if they make three movies then they could get more money with making three parts because that would give the actor more money after third movie all actors can enjoy celebrating 12 years of making movie franchise!. So don't because angry or frustrated if Louis Leterrier decide to make this finale split in to three parts instead of original idea of three parter because that's the only way they can make more money that it would help stop causing worldwide problems like delaying favorite TV and new movies that are so pose come out so let the Screenplayers to what they want because they don't make lot of money they might go on strike if this doesn't happens this message goes out to all the movie critics out there that it's tough for people to make movie these past few years with inflation with food and gas prices go way up to extreme level of prices which means lot of people need gas to get to the studio which they can't do it if they don't get paid extra for making movies so they need new contracts so they need to make deal that both people won't be happy about the agreement but it's way that both people studio also including screenplayers both get there way because that's all Airline companies and there pilots and their flight attendants to keep there service so that's all I am going to say so this movie is must watch. Thank for your time to read my review for fast X.,POSITIVE
"Jun 30, 2023","I quit watching the fast and the furious franchise around #5, it just got way to silly and over the top for my liking. I went to watch this movie and yet again I wasn't impressed. Jason Momoa is one of my favorite actors currently and he looked like he was having a blast on this set, however the corny, childish and silly characteristics they gave him on this movie just completely took me out. It was extremely hard to see him menacing at any time because of his little child like mannerisms. I should have just waited for it to stream, knowing what I know now I would never have allowed myself to red box this movie much less go to the theater to watch.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 30, 2023","After two decades and ten installments, the Fast and Furious franchise has strayed far from its thrilling original and delved into the realm of the ludicrous. The repetitive plot lines and unrealistic car stunts have become tedious. Vin Diesel and the rest of the cast, resurrected or new, are hardly doing any acting anymore and look like a bunch of adults playing pretend. The movie lost its emotional core after the seventh part, and every sequel that came after has been unintelligent and derivative. The fact that three more films are in the works shows Hollywood's greed for creating mindless cash grabs.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 30, 2023","After the ludicrous F9, Jason Momoa steals the show as the flamboyantly vicious villain, Dante, in Fast X.

I really liked the movies up until Furious7, which was already really absurd, but it still worked because I cared about the characters, especially Brian.

"Jun 28, 2023","by far one of the worst movies ive seen in my entire life, characters appearing from nowhere that we are supposed to care about, for example the brazilian sister in law, cringed me to HELL when she said.... take care of your son.....MY NEPHEW. 

LOL, top screenwriting there.

action was lame, and boring, effects where ok, sometimes very amateur like the bomb on fire, the pacing BORING, roman should die a glorious death because he is pointless also not funny. 

what else can i say? the movie was so bad i needed to express myself so i signed up to rotten tomatoes for the first time, even The Rise of Skywalker couldnt do that lol",NEGATIVE
"Jun 28, 2023","I could waste my time by writing a full-on detailed paragraph on why this movie is terrible, but I know I can sum it all up in about 1 sentence. 
This movie doesn't understand physics, characters, dialog, fight scenes, emotions, or how kids function.
It's not enjoyable to watch in any manner. The Cgi is wrong and bad, the logic is nonexistent and it's just not good in any manner.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 28, 2023","it's an action-packed adventure that delivers non-stop excitement. With jaw-dropping visuals and thrilling stunts, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.

"Jun 27, 2023","Fast and Furious, the latest installment in the adrenaline-fueled franchise, delivers an enjoyable cinematic experience with its trademark high-octane action sequences. While it boasts some thrilling moments and an exceptional performance by Jason Momoa as a flamboyant villain, the film falls short in terms of realism and occasionally struggles with its CGI execution.

One of the film's strongest aspects is undeniably the well-crafted action scenes. Fans of the franchise will not be disappointed, as Fast and Furious continues to push the boundaries of vehicular stunts and daring escapades. The pulse-pounding car chases, intense hand-to-hand combat, and explosive set pieces are sure to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Directorial choices and choreography combine to create sequences that are both visually stunning and emotionally engaging.

A standout performance by Jason Momoa adds an extra layer of excitement to the film. Momoa's portrayal of the flamboyant villain brings charisma, intensity, and a magnetic presence to the screen. His ability to command attention and infuse the character with personality elevates the overall viewing experience. Momoa's presence serves as a compelling foil to the film's protagonists, adding depth to the narrative and raising the stakes of the conflict.

However, the film does stumble in terms of realism. While Fast and Furious has never been known for its adherence to real-world physics, this installment stretches believability even further. Some of the stunts and action sequences defy the laws of physics to a degree that might strain the suspension of disbelief for certain viewers. It's important to approach the movie with a willingness to embrace the over-the-top nature of the franchise.

Additionally, the CGI employed in certain scenes leaves something to be desired. While the film's practical effects and practical stunts are impressive, the reliance on computer-generated imagery is occasionally evident. There are moments when the CGI feels noticeably artificial, taking away from the immersion and impact of those particular scenes. A more seamless integration of practical and digital effects could have helped to maintain consistency throughout the film.

Overall, Fast and Furious offers an enjoyable ride for fans of the franchise. The captivating action sequences, buoyed by Jason Momoa's remarkable performance, are the film's strong points. However, those seeking a more realistic experience may find themselves grappling with the film's extravagant disregard for physics and occasional lapses in CGI quality. Despite these shortcomings, Fast and Furious remains a thrilling and entertaining addition to the series, delivering the exhilaration and escapism that fans have come to expect.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 26, 2023","I really liked this movie. I think these movies are getting a bit over the top with these newer chapters but I think this one found a better balance than the last one. Fast 9 kinda sucked because it just got so stupid but Fast X works better because it balances a fun story and fun action with really silly moments which the last movie could not do as it lost the fun with just the level of crazy moments which I also found a problem with Fast 8 a a little bit of a problem in 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3 but 3 was bad in general. I would say this balance works so well I would call this my 3rd favorite in the franchise because the story of this one did silly and dumb and an actual plot really good but I would say the first 2 our better. This movie still has issues for sure like all the crazy and stupid moments still being kinda dumb to watch at times even if some are fun and the very dumb way the conflict is solved and the talking parts kinda suck due to the rest of the rest of the movie being so fun and the soundtrack is a bit weird and does not fit the tone a lot but still I had a very fun time.

And speaking of the villain,  they gave him the most annoying personity.   He is stuck on ""  iM sO QUirKy. "" for the entire movie .  Like there is a point where he talks to these dead guy's where he tapes their eyes open . Why does he do this ? No clue . They just chalk up all his quirkiness as to him just being insane .  Like this is like something Harley Quinn would do , minus the Harley Quinn charm and instead being done by some dude who switchs around his outfit and dresses like a little girl because he is so "" QUirKy "" .",NEGATIVE
"Jun 26, 2023","This movie is definitely one of my favorites in the franchise. I loved the high stakes and story. It felt like there was more storytelling than the past few films. Jason Momoa carries the story, but Vin Diesel’s acting was a bit better. This movie had the best acting I’ve personally seen from John Cena so far. It really felt like he had a different character. Brie Larson’s acting was a weak unfortunately. Overall, loved this movie. Watch it if you haven’t already! I can’t wait for part 2. This was the most emotional out of the franchise I’ve seen.

"Jun 25, 2023","I'm an old fan of the F&F franchise. I will try to be honest. This is absolutely the worst film of the saga, even worse than when they went to space because at least in that film, they made me laugh and seemed to be deliberately making a parody of themselves. I also appreciated it but, unfortunately, everything was lost in this film. There is no plot, dead characters reappearing, ridiculous dialogues, lack of coherence in scenes and script. For the first time, with F&F, I played with the phone, waiting for it to finish to see what else would happen.
Questions: Why does Momoa acts like the Joker? I'd say this kind of approach would be best left to Ledger and Phoenix.
How does Momoa get alla info and photos of the gang that shouldn't exist because they were taken in private moments?
How does he finds Cypher in ten minutes?
Why (and this happens since few films) do the members of Dom's gang seem to have got Jason Bourne skills? But weren't they all street racers?
You know? As Master Morricone said ""the musical notes are seven, it is hard to create, always, something totally new"" but, in this case was enough to me to create something good.
The biggest question I leave is this. We know that Paul is dead but in this movie it seems ridicoulous how it seems he doesn't exists. Mia is there, the villain is trying to kill all family.... So what? I am sad to say that this franchise ended when Paul passed away.
Let's wait the last episode (because I am still a fan) and see how they will close the franchise.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 22, 2023","The Fast family respects their cars, uses them as their main weaponry, and also wrecks tons throughout the courses across ten films, but how many miles are they willing to push their ride? They are considerate over the analogy in treating your car like forming a bond and not want to push it till it no longer drives in the middle of the road. Their vehicular franchise has finally been felt nearing its end with the gas tank almost empty and the finish line sort-of in sight with quite a distance left to make. But will it be cheerfully celebrated, or sighed upon the journey's end over those who joined the ride and are not there with them? Actually capping a long-running franchise with the concluding chapter(s) set up means anted stakes climaxing the overall narrative, uncertain fates by instinctual, sacrificial heroism, then concluding on peaceful, high note. ""Fast X"" is supposedly a penultimate chapter, and it means business.

Humble beginning in street racing before officer Brian O'Connor went on a run that led to another case and back into the authoritative folds, till he found himself unexcitingly reuniting with Dominic Toretto on a vengeance spree, eventually stranding them as outlaws in Mexico with Dom's sister Mia. They build their ticket out with the help of past associates, plus gaining couple new ones, to execute a heist, showing off their skills on greater proportions drags them into dangerous missions all over the world with unexpected, connected confrontations that makes or breaks their family. Their reliance on their motors pits them into impossible odds, managing to outmaneuver any crossed foes, and resume their peace. But how long can that peace last?

Once again retconning, or able to add a thread through open-ended scenery, with seamlessly added scenes that fits nicely without rearending the priorly existing narrative, the Fast family face their most lethal foe emerging from the shadows most of them thought faded by distance on the rearview mirror. As the 2011 heist brought down Brazilian drug kingpin Herman Reyes and his empire in Rio De Janeiro, only one survived and that is Reyes' son Dante, seeing the chaos and losing his family. Gone into hiding, Dante spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. Dante's inferno is proven terrifying as he separates Dom from his crew, being spread out across the globe forging new alliances and facing old enemies, then the true target gets revealed and the fiery vengeance thickens.

Considering how ""Fast Five"" gave the dormant franchise a boost it was thriving for, the tenth installment relived the exciting action-packed climax as its opening with half of the sequence being new inserts starring Momoa's character's connection during the empirical downfall. Criticism noted the film's coasting on the franchise's biggest and thankful best hits, but the impression made via cinematic language is equivalent to a roller coaster's launching start, and the adrenaline only ceases abruptly on a cliffhanger. Assumingly the pun for ""Fast X"" plays on ""fastest"", and based on the nonstop thrills certifies the descriptively correct title as the action, while mostly grounded this time, keeps on pushing past the level set by its predecessor and replicating some if their previous set pieces onto another level despite the implausible engines that are plain lowbrow.

Orchestrating the dangerous threats in every possible corner ahead of the curve is Jason Momoa's Dante Reyes, rising to be one of the most invulnerably alarming villains, embracing theatricality. Momoa's performance wildly electrifies as hungered for an against-type challenge that hints flamboyancy and gives it his all as a relentless villain but not without his signature charm tuned corrupted. The way he skillfully embodies the maniac stirred a mental image reminiscing in similar aura previously felt through Heath Ledger's phenomenal take on Joker in ""The Dark Knight"". Practically mentally becoming the Fast and Furious version of Joker running the streets, who truly challenged the Fast family more than Charlize Theron's gain, Jason Statham's hunt and Luke Evans' confidence.

Now speeding in the action thriller genre at ridicule stunts, the character-driven aspect stays as the core as previously discussed and realized from ""F9"". You have the first present scene in the family gathering, implicating the calm before the storm when unseen turns then twists ignites the thickening plot in a chain of events. Unbeknownst to them, it will be their last tranquility together, putting an emphasis on ""together"". But even so, the new drivers take over with Brie Larson's Tess, the daughter of Kurt Russel's Mr. Nobody, Alan Ritchson's Aimes who leads Mr. Nobody's agency whilst a composition of O'Connor and Dwayne Johnson's Luke Hobbs, and finally Daniela Melchoir as Isabel with a surprising connection that potentially could resolve one conflict. Then we get nice dynamics throughout from John Cena and Jordana Brewster fighting side by side as reunited siblings, the former protecting his nephew Little B while bonding, and unexpecting though brief with Theron and Michelle Rodriguez teaming up, similar to Johnson and Statham's team-up as initially started in ""The Fate of the Furious"". The impressive stakes-defining action pieces sets up the thrilling stage, including brief bouts being so well-coordinated, they are only relied on for exciting the sole value's peak, leaving the characters to move the story with human drama from their dynamical interactions expressing inner connections that the franchise embraces more since the beginning for promising resonance and amusing humor.

However, there are flawed corners to the best element as there is repetitiveness through their dynamical antics. An example would be the leaf-turning cycle of former threats finding good and aligning themselves as part of the Fast family, then there is continuous beefs that eventually serves in furthering bonds as reassurance that nothing would break it. That goes along another point on how former threats, after all they had caused such as Statham and Evans, side with the family because it shows they can still be victims and diving deeper to find they too have beef with the surfaced antagonist. How this will turn out for Theron's Cipher gets left questioned as she been put in a position to survive. A strong family made up of associated friends, but it seems considering what they are facing here only purposed for the thrills rather not personally as they have yet to face their true test despite frontally tackled in F8, a reversal antithesis to Dom and Brian in the earlier films.",POSITIVE
"Jun 22, 2023","I'll always be excited to watch a new chapter in the franchise and I still get blown away with the action and car sequences. This one didn't disappoint and has a super all star cast.

The bits that are meant to be sad I didn't find sad at all and some of it felt boring.

Other than that, terrible dialogue, an incredibly unsatisfying cliffhanger, and no outstanding set pieces. Of course the action isn't bad or anything, but about 65% of it is hand to hand combat, not exciting and awesome car chases and stunts. F&f is about over the top car stuff that's only explanation is family, but this one is an ehh entry in my opinion.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2023",Decisamente uno dei migliori film della saga. Ottima l'interpretazione di Jason Momoa.,POSITIVE
"Jun 22, 2023","I'm not really an OG f&f fan as I started watching when F9 came, so I just wanted to clear that up first. It started off pretty good with transitioning back in time, was impressed in the first hour, Jason momoa was a very unique villain and they introduced him slowly and perfectly for a unique villain in this franchise. The plot wasn't exactly the best compared to other movies such as Fast Five which is personally my favorite but it was pretty good. I think there were a bit too much plot twists, characters repeatedly were changing sides back and forth. It was not as nail-biting movie, it was just time passing. Aimes wasn't exactly a very unique character, didn't like how he kept changing sides, but it was all okay. They made Dante seem like a psychopath from the very first minute and then his slow character development and hate towards Dominic toretto increasing till the very end. This movie was revolving around lil Brian mainly, and one thing which I didn't like was that this movie was pretty split into 4 sections; one section was vin diesel and his journey in rio de janerio, the other was Jakob and Brian fleeing from the agency, one was letty and cipher escaping and the last one was tej, Roman, Ramsey and Han going around London. They gave the tej, Roman, Han, and ramsey's team fairly less screen time although they are my favorite (mainly because they're pretty funny and wholesome) This is a fairly unique concept as fast and furious is literally about family more than cars. I would've gave this movie a solid 4 stars but the 01:50 hour mark was the one where I lost it all, the chase between Dante and Jakob and dom felt pretty incomplete and underworked, especially if you compare it to other F&F chases, and 2 hour mark was where it started it's focal downfall, I had SO many questions and they left it on like 3 different cliffhangers; where the hell did the sub and Gisele come from??? Like don't get me wrong, I love Gisele but no explanation, no flashback, she randomly appeared and then the movie got cut. I actually was looking forward to Han and Gisele's reunion and I was anxiously waiting for them to show what happened at the plane crash, did they survive? Did anyone die and if yes then who? Did everyone die? Plus why did the plane come from literally out of the blue. But I kept waiting and then they cut the movie off. Like no reunion, no explanation to what happened at the crash. And then what happened with Dante and aimes? They were just standing there saying something big is coming. Like I get it 1 cliffhanger is alright, and to some extent even 2 are alright but 3 cliffhangers at one time is unacceptable. I'm pretty sure in Fast and furious 11 they'll show that everyone survived the crash except for 1 person, I'm theorizing it's maybe tej or Roman as Han literally just died and came back, and Ramsey is fairly new and plays a major role in the movie. Most probably Roman because he doesn't have any special skill set and I can see him dying but not tej. But tbh if Roman dies I will stop watching this franchise because I loved him T-T. And even if he doesn't die, I started to see a downfall in tej and Roman's friendship not only because of the fight but also because they started to become annoyed by each others jokes very often and didn't seem very comfortable with each other (that was my favorite friendship bruh). And Jakob's death was also pretty saddening even though he appeared in just 1 movie before this. Overall as a conclusion, the first 01:50 hours were a solid 4 stars, but rest of the movie was 1 star. The chase scene felt terribly underworked and incomplete. And lastly I had like 5 questions at the end of the movie. Those questions are; how did Gisele come back? what about the crash? Who survived the crash? Who died in the crash? What happened to aimes and Dante? I would've give this movie a 4.5 stars if I was watching this in 2025 when I had access to both fast X and F&F 11. Im pretty sure next movie will be a 5 stars or something because they brought back Gisele (as I said I loved her) and I'd love to see Han and Gisele's reunion lol. It'll be a 1 star if they kill Roman though. This movie left a very empty-ish feeling in my stomach and in all honesty ruined my whole day and now I can't wait for the next movie although it's coming in 2025. I really wish I could take my 2 hours back and watch it when the next movie is released",NEGATIVE

"Jun 20, 2023","Title: ""Fast X

Fast X delivers an exhilarating cinematic experience that will leave fans of the franchise on the edge of their seats. As the tenth installment in the long-running series, the movie continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of high-speed car chases and adrenaline-fueled action.

From the very first scene, Fast X wastes no time in plunging viewers into a world of intense vehicular stunts and heart-pounding sequences. The film's impressive visuals and top-notch special effects make each chase and race a visually stunning spectacle. Whether it's racing through narrow city streets or engaging in daring heists, the action sequences are skillfully executed and keep the audience engaged throughout.

In addition to the mind-blowing action, Fast X also manages to strike an emotional chord. The well-developed characters, played by a talented ensemble cast, bring depth and complexity to the story. The film explores themes of loyalty, family, and redemption, adding a layer of emotional resonance that resonates with audiences.

The chemistry between the cast members is palpable, and their performances are commendable. The charismatic leads bring their A-game, delivering the perfect blend of charm, wit, and intensity. The film also introduces new characters who seamlessly blend into the established Fast and Furious universe, adding fresh dynamics to the narrative.

Furthermore, Fast X pays homage to the franchise's roots while embracing a futuristic and technologically advanced setting. The blend of classic muscle cars with futuristic vehicles creates a visually captivating aesthetic that adds a new dimension to the Fast and Furious universe.

However, Fast X is not without its flaws. At times, the plot feels slightly predictable, and some character arcs may not receive as much attention as others. Nevertheless, these minor shortcomings do not detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the film.

In conclusion, Fast X is a high-octane thrill ride that will satisfy fans and newcomers alike. It successfully combines heart-stopping action, emotional depth, and a visually stunning presentation. Fast X proves that even after ten films, the franchise still has plenty of gas in the tank, and it's a must-watch for any adrenaline junkie or fan of the series.",POSITIVE

The graphics on parts were shocking.
I didn't want to believe the review but I agree that was the worst fast and furious yet. Your killing the film!

"Jun 19, 2023","Comically awful.  When you create a world in a movie, fake or real, the elements surrounding it must work in that realm to have any sort of believability.  Letty and Ciper fight was nonsensical and Letty's back would be broken on the table fall. Cena's rocket car was ridiculous and crafted miraculously for what they needed at that moment. The spinning sequence of Dom getting his kid back in the car was just plain stupid. By the way, his spine would also have been crushed when he backed out of the airplane at least 80' high and landed the Charger on bad guys.  Then again, he was dead in the bus roll in Fast 5 at the very beginning and for sure dead in Furious 7 when he zoomed off the cliff with Ramsey (though she had a helmet!).  Jason Mamoa was horrible as the villain trying to be a crazy unisex, diabolically in control, mastermind who knew all of Cipher's men and found out their family stories to bride them?  Again-stupid.  Why have 2 remote control fuel tanker semis planned to crash into Dom (guess they knew he was coming in an airplane with a Charger in the back) only to also have the whole dam mined to explode?  Why?  Why bring in Rita Moreno or Pete Davidson?  Waste of time as they did nothing for the plot.  Its almost like the creators think we are so dumb that they can throw almost any silly element into a movie as long as its disguised under the moral armor of family and it will make a billion dollars.  Oh wait, apparently it will.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 18, 2023","Fast X, the tenth installment of the Fast & Furious franchise, is a film that can only be described as utter nonsense. Dominic Toretto's seemingly superhuman abilities and his indestructible car push the boundaries of believability. However, the film's non-stop adrenaline-fueled pace keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. While it may be tamer than its predecessors, one would have expected nothing less than a car-to-the-moon scenario. Jason Momoa's portrayal of the villain is eccentric and campy in the best possible way. Despite numerous plot holes and the sense that the story is being dragged out for a potential part two, Fast X remains a highly entertaining experience that is definitely worth watching.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 18, 2023",It was one of my least favorite of the franchise the villain was weird and too much comedy involved,NEUTRAL
"Jun 18, 2023","Fast X

A big splashy pile of rubbish. The plot is a poor rehash of the former movies, with nothing new or compelling to it.

The performance by the cast is mostly bland, except for Jason Momoa and John Cena. This is the most impassive and drab portrayal of Dominic Toretto by Vin Diesel, and this is especially frustrating, as this is meant to be the beginning of the end of this franchise. The supporting characters are numerous, but due to the short screentime and unceremonious entry they have, they all seem like an endless introduction of cameos. Jason Momoa as the villain of this movie is the best thing. He's charismatic and campy, and his jokeresque performance is refreshing. John Cena also gives a good performance, with a good blend of bravado and hilarity.

This franchise is hinged on farfetched action but this instalment is sheer dumb, and the funny ridiculousness that the former instalments have is absent here. The CGI is not good, and the direction and editing can be choppy at times, this is especially poor seeing as this is the sixth most expensive movie ever made, wonder where all the money went, probably to the sprawling uninteresting cast.

"Jun 16, 2023","Title: ""Disappointing and Lackluster: A Missed Opportunity""

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆

Review:

Where do I even begin with this movie? It was an absolute train wreck from start to finish. I had high hopes going in, but it quickly became apparent that those hopes were misplaced. This film failed on multiple levels, leaving me utterly disappointed and unsatisfied.

First and foremost, the plot was convoluted and confusing. It lacked coherence and failed to engage me in any meaningful way. It felt like the writers were trying to cram too many ideas into a single storyline, resulting in a jumbled mess. There were numerous plot holes that were left unaddressed, leaving me scratching my head in frustration.

The character development was practically non-existent. The main characters were one-dimensional and lacked depth. I found it difficult to connect with any of them or invest in their journey. Their actions and motivations often felt arbitrary and inconsistent, further contributing to the overall lack of engagement.

Moreover, the pacing was all over the place. The movie dragged on in certain parts, while rushing through potentially crucial moments that needed more time to breathe. This imbalance disrupted the flow and prevented any sense of rhythm or anticipation from building up.

To make matters worse, the acting was subpar at best. The performances felt wooden and devoid of emotion. It was as if the cast was going through the motions without any genuine investment in their roles. This lackluster acting further detracted from the already weak storytelling.

The cinematography and special effects were equally underwhelming. The visuals lacked creativity and failed to leave a lasting impression. Even the action sequences, which should have been the film's saving grace, felt generic and uninspired. It seemed like the filmmakers relied too heavily on CGI without considering the importance of practical effects and innovative camerawork.

Lastly, the movie failed to deliver any thought-provoking themes or messages. It lacked substance and depth, leaving me wondering what the point of it all was. It felt like a wasted opportunity to explore meaningful ideas and make a lasting impact.

Overall, this movie fell far short of my expectations. It was a mishmash of poorly executed elements that left me feeling unenthusiastic and disengaged. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this lackluster film when there are far better options available. Disappointment. Ending for the first time I hate fast and furious movies I've been watching it since 2001 and I saw all the episodes but this one it's really shame to be watching",NEGATIVE
"Jun 16, 2023",A great action movie3,POSITIVE
"Jun 16, 2023","Fast X is the most the Fast and Furious movie since the last Fast and Furious movie. In otherwise words it was very on brand, does not try to push the boundaries, no one ever dies and action is absurd as ever. The plot is both simple and also a convoluted mess of characters and back stories. Most of the cast was having fun hammering it up, especially new comer Jason Momoa (who is doing his best impression of what if the Joker was Captain Jack Sparrow). The only Debbie Downer was the VIn Diesel, himself, who was strangely serious throughout the movie, like if someone dropped Jason Bourne into the Fast franchise.

Good honest dumb fun, can't wait for the last one.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 16, 2023",Love the Fast and Furious movies always have and always will!! But how do you not show if the uncle and kid make it or not? Now I'm going to be itching for Fast 11,POSITIVE
"Jun 16, 2023","Say it with me,""Jason Mamoa!"". He totally saved this somewhat, seen before F&F movie. He injected some life into the dwindling spark of the once awesome franchise. Remember the days of Fast five, and Fast and furious 7? Well, Fast X doesn't compare to those but at least it doesn't send our boys Roman and Tej into space in old wet suits! Mamoa nails the Dante Reyes character with enough humor and panache to appeal to everyone! And thank you for that! Things needed to be livened up! Vin Diesel is his usual cool self. With all the talk about family. Ya, ya we get it, family is important. Heard it, heard it again,and yet again! Thank you to director Louis Lettier the real time car chases we're back. Not all just green screen. Getting back to the roots of Fast movies and what the fans really want to see. It was an okay movie. Setting up the next installment with a big cliff hanger end. And gave a heartfelt nod to the heart of the franchise, Paul Walker, with a brief but amazing scene with Paul's daughter, Meadow. You'll have to spot her yourself! So go ahead, take the journey down the road to ride or die one more time.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 16, 2023","It was so absurd and nonsensical, the crowd was actually laughing and having a good time. I respect Vin Diesel's commitment to making absurd F&F movies. Jason Momoa absolutely killed as the villain. His acting was actually the best thing about the movie. Left the theater very surprised by his performance.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 16, 2023",The special effects were phenomenal! It is a must see in the theater not at home.,POSITIVE
"Jun 16, 2023","One of the craziest movies ever! Actually it's funny as hell, Cars falling over and buildings, flying from sky, it's whoever funny, it's an improvement from the Fast 9.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 16, 2023","If you enjoy the franchise, then you'll love this.  Nonsensical over-the-top action and all the elements that keep us coming back.  Mamoa steals the show a bit...and I'll deduct a star for re-writing the ending which (no spoilers here) makes some of the earlier film plot make even less sense than usual.  Still happily looking forward to FastX Part 2 (or whatever they'll call it, lol).",POSITIVE
"Jun 16, 2023","What's good: Jason Momoa's evil psychopath villain, the cars, Dom and his family. What's not so good: not enough cars, the drift towards military hardware and violence, special effects that are just too over-the-top. What made this such a great franchise originally was that it was a bunch of diverse characters really lavishing attention on their cars which were fast, furious, and beautiful. There also were some playful ideas about cops and robbers having a lot in common, maybe even being two sides of the same coin. Now it's all weird secret government agencies and unbelievably powerful villains pulling off really expensive effects all over the globe. It's gotten bloated and could do with a back-to-basics entry. This is not that entry.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 16, 2023",Hopefully Fast 11 delivers better than this...,NEGATIVE
"Jun 16, 2023","I know these movies have gone very over the top with all their stunts but this one takes the cake. they do stuff straight out of a roadrunner cartoon. it's hard to suspend disbelief when you have people that can do things the Avengers can't even do.😄 the only one worth watching here is Jason mamoa for his jokes...but overall, it's just typical crazy fast and furious. 4/10",NEGATIVE
"Jun 16, 2023",Wonderful entertainment.  10 out of 10.,POSITIVE
"Jun 16, 2023",i think its time to stop making sequels.. thought this one would be different... boy was i Wrong!!!  i will not waste my money anymore on this film...  might as well turn this film into superhero marvel movie...  🥺😢,NEGATIVE

"Jun 15, 2023",Cumulo de acción sin sentido,NEGATIVE
"Jun 15, 2023",good start to summer films. if you like the fast franchise then you will enjoy it. the end left me with too many questions..i am guessing there will be another.,POSITIVE
"Jun 15, 2023","About average for The Fast an Furious series.  However, it was difficult to believe a White and Hispanic couple, Dominic and Letty had a African-American child. How did this happen? Did Letty have an affair with the milkman when Dominic was away.  I wonder how many Hispanic and White child actors got passes over so Hollywood could fill their new diversity rules. Sadly, this will not get people back out to the movies.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 15, 2023",Excellent movie.  Stay for the credits.,POSITIVE

"Jun 15, 2023",good not great. mamoa makes the movie,NEUTRAL
"Jun 15, 2023",A terrible child actor. Terrible dialog from Tyrese and team. Bre Larson geezus unwatchable.  Jason mamoa is probably the best thing about the film.,NEGATIVE
"Jun 15, 2023",Really enjoyed the action sequences from beginning to end...unbelievable but fun to watch. Didn't disappoint.,POSITIVE
"Jun 15, 2023","I must acknowledge the efforts made in this latest installment, particularly the absence of cars being launched into space. However, it saddens me to say that this film continues the trend of mindless entries in a series that lost its direction long ago.

The movie feels like a mere collection of explosive sequences, celebrity appearances, and high-speed car chases scattered throughout, lacking a cohesive narrative to tie them together.

Regrettably, the ending proved to be particularly anticlimactic. It abruptly concluded in the midst of an action sequence, leaving the viewer with a sense of dissatisfaction after investing three hours into the film.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 15, 2023","Well there's a lot of different story lines going on at once and so much action so many characters it was a little much. Felt very fake . Also Jason Momoa had the potential to be so bad ass like he is in movies but he was flamboyant and almost acted like the joker in a cartoon, very not him and seemed so unnatural like when you watch something and feel embarrassed for them . Plot twist in the end was unnecessary with the girls. Also Dons son grew up to be a mixed kid, which is funny because his mom was white makes you think the whole time that it's not his kid 😂 Not horrible movie just some was hard to watch. John Cena did wonderful his storyline was great .",NEGATIVE
"Jun 15, 2023",I don't know what I just watched if car makers can clone vins car there would never be a fatal crash again. It can go to space drive thru everything and fight a helicopter meanwhile I have no clue if it ended or if they just forgot to add anything to do with cars n racing. Oh n they r all high tech fbi style skilled now they can fix anything with a 90s style laptop n flip phones.,NEGATIVE

"Jun 15, 2023","What a trash! I thought Disney's movies were bad, but heck. This is simply stupid! End this garbage already",NEGATIVE
"Jun 15, 2023","I've watched this franchise since the first film, when Brian was a cop, and this is by far the worst installment.  The stunts, which is what the film is all about, are so unbelievable that not even a comic-book would ask the reader to accept it.  The acting, despite having a few Oscar-winners, is strictly middle-school quality.  And, Jason Momoa, who started his career trying to be respected, is an embarrassment to himself, his family, and his ancestors.  I have to think he was drunk the entire time.  The Final Insult, that I'll mention since the movie has be out for so long & it's less of a spoiler, is the Unresolved Ending.  And the return of yet another ""dead"" fan favorite.  This entire film is just a set-up for an anticipated 3-film franchise conclusion.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 15, 2023","Horrible, cringed, bad story, bad acting. A totally waste of time.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 15, 2023","I always think that the previous fast n furious is the worst movie I ever seen, till watch the next new one.
Really, I wast my time",NEGATIVE
"Jun 15, 2023",It’s really amazing.I would recommend this movie,POSITIVE
"Jun 15, 2023","It's enjoyable, but if you're looking for a car movie, you're in the wrong place. This is now the latest in the line of superhero movies. And apparently the main superpower of everyone in the group is the ability to resurrect themselves from the dead. Well, except for Paul Walker, who never really died in the movies, but... well... you know... 

There is very LITTLE DNA left of the original Fast and Furious movies. The cars can fly now and drive on walls, and swing from pieces of twine. The characters seem to be immortal, with a general superpower of escaping any daring situation with minor injury. And with the mind altering powers of persuasion, of Dom Toretto, they can convert any enemy to a friend within 2 movies. 

Overall though, if you are willing to suspend the idea that it's rooted in the original Fast and Furious movies, it's at least a fun watch. Jason Momoa is an absolute pleasure to watch, and has a Joker-like quality throughout the whole movie. Oddly, I knew he was the bad guy, but really just wanted to see what creative torture he was going to come up with next for Bat-Dom . 

Summary... Worth the watch, enjoyable, but don't expect a car movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 15, 2023","Boring, repetitive, unimaginative",NEGATIVE
"Jun 15, 2023","It was good and entertaining. They just add a couple of scenes that felt out of place in the story line. Jason Momoa character was good, it has some characteristics from The Joker.",POSITIVE
"Jun 15, 2023","Lots of great action, one of the best movies.",POSITIVE
"Jun 15, 2023","When you go watch a Fast & Furious saga movie, you know exactly what you're getting tickets for. The moment you enter the movie theatre you have to leave outside everything learnt in physics class and surrender to everything you see on screen. And you know why: If it defies the laws of men, Toretto and his gang do it. And if it defies the laws of God and physics, they do it twice. So, don't ask too much from this movies. They're here to entertain and they deliver perfectly, just as this last entry of the Fast saga does. That's why i consider 4 stars must be awarded. After all, it's technically a good movie that delivers the next logical step in the saga, respecting the lore installed by the previous movies with a little twitch in order to reach where we are going.
I actually enjoyed and i want to see whats next.",POSITIVE
"Jun 14, 2023","Hot mess. It's is becoming like Marvel movies. Just throw in every character ever written in the franchise, stir them up and throw it out onto the screen. But if you like action, go see it.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 14, 2023",Dont know how the series turned into a really bad disney movie,NEGATIVE
"Jun 14, 2023",I can't. This was meant for the guys you knew in high school who grew up to be full-time forklift operators who swear this is the best series they've ever seen. Please.,NEGATIVE
"Jun 14, 2023","The movie was good, I do enjoy watching the fast and the furious Saga, but the movie is just getting boring they keep on making the same thing every movie that comes out. When Paul passed away, they should’ve just ended it on Fast 7 or Fast 8, I feel like this is disrespect to Paul Walker, by making so many fast and furious movies, but not showing him and acting like he’s in the movie still No but they kept on making more movies. But we’ll see how far the Fast Saga goes. If they make a part 3 or a Fast 11 this is just going to get ridiculous.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 14, 2023","Fast X was such a cinematic delight. I really enjoyed seeing this cast work together again as a team, their loyalty to one another is evident. The strong bonds in this movie are refreshing and relatable. Friends that become family that you would do anything to protect. They all truly outdid themselves killing the endless fast action packed, heart racing moments. Although the scene where Dom whom I still love drives off a highway and somehow still survives and drives off is too far fetched just not believable in my opinion.  Now lets talk about the amazing ladies, whom were so badass in this movie, especially in the fight scenes so refreshing to see women in such heroic roles. OMG newcomer to the fast and Furious series, Jason Momoa killed it in his role as Dante Reyes. I loved every single moment so much he unpredictable and unhinged yet still made me laugh so much made me love the villain more than the heroes in this movie. Fast X is by far my favorite of this series definitely a must see fans.",POSITIVE
"Jun 14, 2023",Lots of action worth seeing and that's about it.  Nothing special but still a must see for the Fast and Furious franchise.  Feels like a TV episode.,NEUTRAL

"Jun 14, 2023","BIG NO! Where was the cast. I just seen a wana be genie. Torettos team were not around. And this movie had no action from what it should have. Its about the cars the racing, that was barely shown! And the ending, no way! Why just why???? I love these fast and furious movies, but this one needs to be deleted and remade! No fair they are ending the franchise and like this!! Producer please fix this movie, make it like the others! Stop trying so hard!!",NEGATIVE

"Jun 14, 2023","This is a well known franchise by now but has it gone too far? Yes and no. I definitely enjoyed Fast X more than the two previous movies in the series, but I don't feel the last movies have been necessary to be honest. It's a great action movie but it's a meh car/racing movie.

"Jun 14, 2023",Honestly ever Fast and Furious movie has had a very positive and ending that can lead to family always coming back together. Not sure if their will be one or two more but the cliff hanger ending creates so much about what could be next. I can’t wait to see what happens next.,POSITIVE
"Jun 14, 2023","Despite the repetitiveness of the Fast and Furious franchise, Fast X delivers something different and executes a Part 1 movie nearly perfectly. It's a simple movie about (believe it or not) family and serves some incredible action sequences and a genuinely threatening, but funny, villain in Jason Momoa which compliments the rest of the cast well. The only place the movie struggled was not knowing how to handle the amount of characters and has some pacing issues in the second act.",POSITIVE

"Jun 14, 2023","I definitely cringed a few times, but the movie wasn’t for my enjoyment, it was for my dad. My dad loves action and even if it’s dumb he’ll enjoy it. So, personally 3, but it kept my dad happy and entertained so in that aspect 4",NEUTRAL

"Jun 14, 2023","I thought the movie was 10/10 honestly!! And i was not expecting it to be that good. But i had to see it because of Jason Mamoa and he did not disappoint. I wasnt expecting that from his character, but he was hilarious and played crazy really well. Story line and plot was similar to previous movies, but it was still good. Action scenes were great. I feel like this is one of the best Fast and Furious movies out of all of them.",POSITIVE

"Jun 13, 2023","It's a complete waste of time. This franchise should have died years ago, but for some reason, I guess greed and lack of creativity, they can't stop milking the brand and even the physically dead Paul Walker. Just stop!",NEGATIVE
"Jun 13, 2023",It’s a “Fast” movie. The entire basis is cars…explosions….guns….aircraft….A list stars…. It was ultimately entertaining for my son and I. But the sequels just keep going and going and going. Worthy of nostalgic entertainment value.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 13, 2023",Momoa is worth the price of admission. The directing is choppy. And some scenes come across as being “phoned-in”. ,NEUTRAL
"Jun 13, 2023","As a longtime fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, I've come to expect and even enjoy its hallmark exaggerated hyped up over-the-top action and driving scenes. However in this tenth installment, while being thoroughly entertained with some of the opening action scenes (like Rome etc.), I found myself losing interest around the halfway mark with the seemingly nonstop cartoonishly CGI action, that was completely lacking any semblance of realism whatsoever. It's like they wanted to cram too much of these types of effects in, and it just comes across as goofy in my opinion. Another gripe is while I usually don't mind Jason Momoa, I really disliked his portrayal of the villain. I just found him annoying as hell, and he became even more increasingly irritating as the film unfolded. Recommend viewing for longterm fans of the series, but newcomers steer clear, because I highly doubt FF-X would get anyone hooked in to exploring the previous gems.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 13, 2023","The theater was clean and nice the location was awesome as well. 
What I didn't like was the servers bringing food on the middle othe movie and blocking your view of the screen. I think there should be another way of doing this.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 13, 2023","I don't know, why the quality of the F&F movies is falling so drastically. Maybe the scriptwriters strike is part of the problem (namely - the reason of those strikes, bad attitude towards scriptwriters and scripts as a whole).

The movie doesn't have a plot at all. The whole story is just awfully terrible. The main antagonist isn't explained at all, nothing for the audience to condemn or relate. He is JUST bad...same as protagonists, right? But no, if it's Dom - You cannot do anything to his family. But if Dom is doing something against someone else's family - that's ok. Murdering a whole bunch of people on the way - that's even better. Destroying the capital of Italy - nah, it's ok. The bloody enemy of the previous parts, who killed one of your family? Nah, he's now our friend.

The script. It's...it's something, that would lose even on a highschool competition level. Seriously. The behavior of the characters, the dialogues, the scenes...what the actual hell. It looks like the actors had to write their own phrases themselves. That is not a level of a multimillion film. A whole squad of armed soldiers can't catch a girl with a kid?

The end and the hint for the future story? Oh come on, what can possibly happen next...

This is just plainly terrible.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 13, 2023","the movie is nothig but lazy writing and excesssive use of green screen ,the movie is an insult to the intelligence of the viewer , vin diesel need to stop milking a cow who's been dead since 2015 , all those movies since the 7th one are doing is building hatred toward the franchis",NEGATIVE
"Jun 13, 2023",It's way better than I expected from this movie and it ends in good cliffhanger which makes you wanna see the second one.But Note DO NOT TAKE THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY It literally ends the laws of physics and so unrealistic from the real world.Just sit back and enjoy the movie of what it is.,POSITIVE

"Jun 13, 2023",I was raised on these movies so out of 10 I will say 30/10. The only thing that I wish we could have seen would be mia's and Brian's child. I love how Jason Momoa brought so much to the screen with the character that he was given. But every time I see these movies I always wish I can have a family that there like that. Read to fight and protect the ones they care for no matter the cost. So it's a 💯.,POSITIVE

"Jun 12, 2023","It's a worthwhile sequel, except for 2-3 unrealistic action sequences, but not as usual as previous installments. Back-to-back high-speed chases and first-fight scenes don't get you bored. Jason Momoa is a surprise package as a villain, and John Cena proves that he can act as well. Charlie's Theron shines again in her villainous role. After a long time, I must say that the franchise has matured enough to make sure it continues to entertain its fan base for several years to come.

It's hard to describe how bad this movie is. The acting, dialogue, plot and so on are at such a low level that this is some kind of record. This will go down in the history of the film industry as an example of the degradation of cinema.

"Jun 12, 2023","Fast X is another exhausting brainless blockbuster to grace your local movie theaters. It retains the same nonsensical, action and defiance of physics and the laws of gravity as fast nine. Thankfully, it isn't as laden and excruciating as the previous entry thanks largely to the histrionics and theatrics of Jason Momoa, who does play a solid, joker knock off as the villain. Vin Diesel once again, Waze, what should be a buoyant action adventure down with his depressive demeanor. There is no need for two more films. One more to close out the entire saga would suffice.",NEGATIVE

I love all of the movies so much and this one met my expectations.",POSITIVE
"Jun 12, 2023","Jason Mamoa is flamboyant and as outsized in personality as these movies are in physics. It is a nice counterpoint to the weird machismo that made little sense when there weren't hot girls in tiny outfits everywhere.

No the movie is not ""bad-bad"" but it's like a gulp of gasoline from the tube, an unwanted minor accident. Not something worth making.

Bikes in this movie are still _amazing_ though..",NEGATIVE
"Jun 12, 2023","Its story made absolutely no sense, terrible screenplay, but good action. And that's practically all the movie is aiming for, it knows its premise is absolutely ridiculous, but it doesn't really care about its story.

There's fight scenes with music now, high tech military scenes and at one point I thought I was watching the movie Crank.  Make the movie about cars dammit.   Y'all could have incorporated a new ZR1 or the Dark Horse there are so many cars coming out.  There was literally 1 racing scene.  I'm done with these cheesy movies",NEGATIVE

My kids pull better stunts with real effects then any scene in this 2 hours and 21 minutes waste of time movie.

 so much codedt make it a good movie.
for people in the moveie that are good at computers to be hacked is a joke!!!
The bomb going through Rome, buses and other moter mobiles can't stop the bomb but one car can? dosen't make sense, mabe its not suppose to. 
Storyline doesn't add up to the rest of the moveies so thats another star gone. 
don't mind the fighting sences with the girls fighting each other because they look more (sexy) appeals to the men/women?
I have to say that that the comedy is epic in this movie that that is what we all need right now, haven't laughed so much in a long time.

Charlize Theron , Brie Larson and Alan Ritchson deserved more scenes/dialogues. It's so repetitive , we know what will happen in every scene. And "" family"", Mia doesn't seem to have her place in this franchise. All is too formulaic, predictable with  corny dialogue. Action sequences aren't stimulating enough and the emotion falls flat.

"Jun 11, 2023","The Fast movies have been steadily going downhill with each new itteration, but this one manages to be a little bit better then it's predecessor. 

Everyone loves an over the top action movie, but Fast 9 and Fast X just get a rocket and go far over the top. Seeing them launch a rocket into space was just straight up ridiculous. 

This movie doesn't do anything as ridiculous as that, but still does too much ridiculous stuff to be taken seriously. Seeing Vin Diesel's character lift a dodge charger with just one hand, or racing of the side of a dam is just idiotic.

The only really good thing about this movie is the villain. Jason Momoa shines in his role and gives of Joker-like vibes, which i really love. 

This is one of those watch at home movies when you're bored, but definitely don't go to the theaters to watch this.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 11, 2023",We got what we paid for!,POSITIVE
"Jun 11, 2023","More of the same, but slight better. Fast X is a slight improvement upon its predecessor, F9, injecting some energy that was sorely lacking in the last movie. It comes with all the tropes you expect from this franchise. The contrived villain, the implausible action sequences, the death defying stunts, the bloated cast of characters, the nonsensical plot conveniences. It's all here.

This film feels a little more grounded than its predecessor, with one scene in particular feeling like a nice little callback to the original 2001 film.
The cast all deliver performances expected of them. They know what exactly what to do after all these years, except for Sung Kang as Han, who looks bored and disinterested throughout the movie. Jason Momoa is unhinged as the new baddie Dante Reyes, clearly having the time of his life in the role. Daniela Melchior is a welcome addition as steer racer Isabel Neves, the sister of little Brian's late mother, Elena. Even Brie Larson delivers a decent performance in her role.

These movies aren't the type that warrant a detailed nitpicking or plot analysis, but If I had to level two major criticisms against the film, it would be the CGI. It's very noticeable. For a film that coast over $300 MILLION to make, I'd expect the effects to appear more seamless. Another would be the fact that It's very noticeably a set-up for another movie. While there's nothing wrong with setting up events for future pay-offs, it fails to stand on its own and feels as if too many things are happening at once.

I don't consider myself to be a diehard fan of the ""Fast Saga"", but if I'm being honest, I've come to appreciate them not only for what they are, but what they stand for. That is, a bygone era. The action, the macho men, the exotic locations, the attractive women, the camaraderie. They represent a bygone era in Hollywood. A time when movies just focused on entertaining their audience, as opposed to lecturing on modern society's evils. This one's certainly not going going to win over any new fans, but if you're already a fan, you'll get a kick out of Fast X.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 11, 2023",honestamente no crei que hubiera otra pelicula de la saga que superara a la 7 en fantacia. pero lo mas gracioso es que hasta logro con creces. siendo a mi parecer la peor de la saga hasta ahora. una pelicula llena de escenas absudas. minomo deberian tener un rasguño. digo para hacerla un poco mas creible si es que eso es posible.,NEGATIVE
"Jun 11, 2023",It was fast-paced fun with a lot of the characters from the franchise.  Loved the action!!,POSITIVE
"Jun 11, 2023",Ridiculous at times but enjoyable throughout.  Jason Momoa made the movie what it was.  An excellent ansemble of actors.,POSITIVE
"Jun 11, 2023","Enjoyed it! If your going into any of the F&F movies expecting real-life driving scenarios grounded in reality, them your an idiot! If you watch it for what it is, summer movie that's FX heavy mindless fun. If u are in that mindset then the movie is entertaining fun!",POSITIVE
"Jun 11, 2023",It was horrible dont watch it,NEGATIVE
"Jun 11, 2023","Way too many actors, no storyline, too many 6 vs 1 fights, special effects are simply not believable.  They need to cut the number of actors, make it more believable and actual write a story that gets you attached to the actors. They would be more successful with 1/2 the budget…

The only good part was the yellow Z.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 11, 2023","Miss the old movies where the racing and action was real… all the new movies are becoming extremely fake, unrealistic scenes, horrible acting and same plot as all the previous movies… it's safe to say they need to stop making more movies.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 11, 2023",This movie needed to die a long time ago. Honestly after Paul Walker died so did this movie. It was literally from about F7 on that it just went off the rails dumb. FX was not as bad as 9 but pretty bad nonetheless. F11? Nope I’ll pass.,NEGATIVE

"Jun 11, 2023","FastX lines us up for something very spectacular. With part 2 already having a release date, we could potentially get a third and final part in the next two years after part 2. This movie is amazing, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a lot of action. This movie is not a filler movie like everyone seems to think it is. It just helps paint the picture between FastFive and FastX(i.e. 10 years).",POSITIVE
"Jun 11, 2023",Daunte/Jason Momoa? Big mistake. Completely doesn't fit in the overall feel of F&F movies. I ended up just forwarding through the stupid lines and always having his arms outstretched (weird). That character pretty much ruined the movie for me. His lines were horribly written and didn't fit in anywhere.  The action and driving scenes were great of course. Hated the ending too. Worst F&F of all.,NEGATIVE

"Jun 11, 2023","Awful, Awful, Awful. The same tired premise, based not at all in reality, and was painful to watch most of the time. The storyline was a copy of so many past FF movies. Save your money and avoid it.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 11, 2023","This movie would have been great had Jason Momoa's role would have been more serious and making everything out of a joke! That annoyed me through the whole movie! Raymond Reigns the wrestler would have been ideal for Herman Reyes son. Otherwise, this would have been a very good movie!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 11, 2023","Despite the not so great reception this has gotten, I think it’s a fun movie and better than it’s predecessor F9.  Jason Momoa was over the top, but a great villain.  There are some wild and pretty amazing action sequences.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 11, 2023","BANG, CRASH, EXPLOSION, SPRAY TAN, YAWN, END...I just spoiled the entire movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 11, 2023",They tried to fit too much in the movie. The ending was terrible.,NEGATIVE

"Jun 11, 2023",I loved everything about this movie. Since Fast 9 was full they definitely made up with this one!!!,POSITIVE
"Jun 11, 2023","A lot better than 9 but still ridiculous. They continue to make these ridiculous stunts, unnecessary revivals from the dead, and dumb story lines. Not even close to what the core of the franchise originally was. We never saw that in the first few movies and they are a world favorite. 

I gave it 2 stars because Jason mamoa portrayed he's character in such a funny and twisted way.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 11, 2023","The action isn't as good as say mission impossible, mostly because it's not really believable. Jason Momoa and John Cena was the best part of this movie. There was a few funny moments. It's kind of hard to get emotional over characters who may or may not die if they always come back to life.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 10, 2023",Great action!!! Really enjoyed this movie!! Definitely lived up to the series.,POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2023","The movie was just good ol fun to watch, if you're okay with over the top Hollywood stories. What made the movie great was quite unexpected for me. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of Momoa, but he absolutely killed it in this movie along with the other colorful personalities like John Cena, Tyrese and Ludacris. I haven't watched the last couple but I'll definitely watch the next one.",POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2023",Jason Momoa was perfect,POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2023","This movie is suppose to be about cars, racing, cops etc. The villain's character ruin the movie. His character does not belong in this movie he should stick to doing his aquaman movies. They are starting to make this like a Peter Pan movie with the villain smh.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 10, 2023",I liked how it brought everyone back except Brian. It was full of action can't wait for the next one.,POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2023","Except for the performance of Jason Momoa, this is a mess.  Too many set pieces that are marginally connected, the story is irritating because it is filled with cameos and stars adding nothing.  Fans will love it, i imagine.  Anyone who is only a little interested should keep away.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 10, 2023",Flogging a dead horse much,NEGATIVE
"Jun 10, 2023","Jason Mamoa is EVERYTHING in this movie, plus this film was fun to watch in addition to his performance. MUCH better than the last TWO. Once you accept that Dom Toretto and his team are actually witches or something with superhuman understanding of cars, explosions, physics, luck, and plot devices, you will be much better off to enjoy any of these films. It's what I do and I'm WAY happier for it (except for when they go to space in the previous films; spoiler alert: they DON'T do that here, thank God!).",POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2023",Action and on your seat cliff hanger Far as shot them up action films go a true to fashion man movie,POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2023","The movie was amazing. Jammed pack action throughout every scene. It had intense twists and turns that left you guessing. They included so many amazing surprises I wasnt ready for and alliances I couldnt have ever predicted. Not to mention the villain they chose, he is certifiably wacko but perfect for this series. Roller coaster ride of emotions and amazement and I loved every moment. Family for life and I cant wait to see Fast 11.",POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2023","Entering this particular film, my expectations were low, assuming they had exhausted all possibilities. However, upon watching it, I found myself reinvigorated with enthusiasm for the Fast franchise! Undoubtedly, it was packed full of guns, explosions, and fast cars, yet it was the narrative that genuinely captivated my attention once more.",POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2023","OK! you should know what you are going to get with this series> But this one is a little too absurd, good guys crash into bad guys - bad guys cars are totaled, good guys car looks like it was in a fender bender. Good guys cars fly thru the air or off an airplane and the people and car are mostly fine. Too exaggerated",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2023","My initial thought,  this needs to be the last Fast movie. But after seeing Fast X, I changed my mind. My opinion Jason Momoa saved this sequel. Fast needed a new super villain who is in some way connected to the story time line. Fast X did a perfect job creating that  for Dante. The only thing I would take back from the movie is a little detail of Hans hair style is long and not short when he met Shaw again in the post ending credit. Overall, the mood and creative direction of Jasons ( Im DanteIm Shante) performance made this sequel fresh and enjoyable!",POSITIVE

"Jun 10, 2023","'Fast X' is the latest addition of the Fast franchise, and the beginning of it's end.

SYNOPSIS: 'Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto and his family have outsmarted and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they must confront the most lethal opponent they've ever faced. Fueled by revenge, a terrifying threat emerges from the shadows of the past to shatter Dom's world and destroy everything -- and everyone -- he loves.'

The franchise has moved on so much from its origins and for many that's not something many they like. For me, I sit somewhere in the middle.

This film continues the franchise's mission to scale up and be bigger and louder than ever before. We're well beyond turning things up to 11 now, we're up about 15 at present. At times this film is a full throttle, all action, CGI layden roller coaster. Unfortunately though there's very little substance beyond that. The story is a mess and there are so many inconsistencies throughout the film it's painful. 

It's overlong and over the top, and this film starts to acknowledge how absurd the franchise has become. And that's a real problem.

I don't hate this film I just accept it for what it is, a big blockbuster of a mess of a film.

Buckle up, grab the popcorn and prepare to crash and burn.

6/10",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2023","Fast X, the latest installment in the high-octane franchise, delivers another turbo-charged rush of jaw-dropping action and heart-pounding excitement. Buckle up, because this film takes the Fast and Furious series to new heights, leaving fans with their adrenaline levels at an all-time high.

From the very first scene, Fast X dives headfirst into a world of mind-boggling stunts, gravity-defying chases, and awe-inspiring vehicular warfare. The movie wastes no time, serving up a relentless barrage of breathtaking set pieces that will have you gripping your seat in awe.

The charismatic ensemble cast, led by the incomparable Vin Diesel, brings their A-game once again. Their chemistry and camaraderie shine through, injecting the film with both heart and humor amidst the chaos. Newcomers to the franchise make a memorable impact, seamlessly integrating into the adrenaline-fueled family dynamic.

Fast X not only excels in its exhilarating action sequences but also delves deeper into the personal stories of its characters. The film explores themes of loyalty, family, and sacrifice, providing emotional depth that resonates throughout. Amidst the tire-screeching madness, moments of genuine human connection remind us why we've grown to love these characters over the years.

Visually, Fast X is a marvel. The breathtaking cinematography captures every heart-stopping moment with precision, showcasing the grandeur and scale of the high-speed escapades. The seamless integration of practical effects and cutting-edge CGI enhances the immersive experience, blurring the line between reality and fantasy.

However, as with any film in a long-running franchise, some moments may feel familiar or predictable. While Fast X attempts to introduce new twists and turns, it does rely on certain tropes and formulaic elements that fans have come to expect. Nonetheless, the film's relentless energy and sheer spectacle make it easy to overlook these minor shortcomings.

Fast X is a rollercoaster ride of pure entertainment, delivering on its promise to provide an adrenaline rush like no other. It's a must-watch for fans of the franchise and action enthusiasts alike. So fasten your seat belts and prepare for a turbo-charged thrill ride that will leave you breathless.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 10, 2023","I truly believe that this movie had potential to be great, it had a lot of fun action scenes in a lot of excitement, but it just fell flat a lot

"Jun 10, 2023",This is one the best and most fun of the Fast and Furious sequels. Yet this is when critics and even most fans had enough. It made the less at the box office and the reviews were low. Jason Mamoa since Slumberland has learned to have more fun in his movies. He easily steals the show as the villain. ,NEUTRAL

"Jun 9, 2023","You can tell they had a big budget for this one, except the dialogues are cringy and cheesy.

"Jun 9, 2023","This movie is bland even for the standards of the Fast and Furious franchise. Jason Momoa shines as a  Star among stadium lights, whenever he's on screen you forget how bad this movie is. My final takeaway is that it's impressive that they continue to make these movies, especially as Vin Diesels ""ability"" to act continues to become less and less believable.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 9, 2023","Fast X is a thrilling two-hour, 21-minute ride that takes you across multiple cities, from Los Angeles to Rome, Rio, Portugal, and London. Director Louis Leterrier makes the most of his budget, delivering exhilarating action scenes like a bomb bouncing through the streets of Rome and a massive vault being dragged through Rio. While it doesn't reach the same level of outlandishness as Fast 9's space stunt, the film still packs a punch. The story kicks off with a gripping flashback, pulling Dominic Toretto out of his peaceful life and into a collision with the vengeful Dante Reyes, son of a drug lord. Jason Momoa injects the film with a burst of energy, bringing a unique and intense performance. After over 20 years, the cast may not be as fast or furious, but Momoa's presence revitalizes the sequel.",POSITIVE

However, it would have been great if the ending had been more carefully crafted instead of feeling abruptly cut off.",NEUTRAL

It is everything that you could and should expect from that team.",POSITIVE
"Jun 9, 2023",I usually love watching Jason Momoa but he was not the right part for this role. Even scene he tried to act crazy just made us cringe. They really made a joke of the whole thing writing that character like that and just putting in whoever is famous at the time instead of casting who was fit for an already questionable role.,NEGATIVE
"Jun 9, 2023","This movie left me speechless. No movie out currently can even compart to Fast X. The cars man, THE CARS ARE AMAZE BALLS.

"Jun 9, 2023","Action packed from start to finish. If you like the franchise, you'll need to see Fast X.",POSITIVE
"Jun 9, 2023","While Fast X started on a decent premise of relating things back to the furious family's greatest success (Fast 5) it lacked something it desperately needed... a decent script.  

The characters just conveniently do things to progress the story without any real depth, arc, motivation or development and that's a real shame considering the pool of talent that was in this film.  Plus the fact that the main cast talked this film up prior to it's release set expectations a little too high.  

Momoa's villian while interesting is so comical I can't really take him seriously and again I don't blame the actor, I think the problem was the script... the villain should have been more malevolent to justify a real threat to the Toretto's and the cliffhanger ending might have worked if he successfully kidnapped Dom and Mia's kids saving room for Fast 11.   Another thing is bringing back characters who are supposed to be dead with no explanation is lackluster not blockbuster.  A series that has been running as long as the Fast saga has a serious following and fans get attached to their heroes and mourn their fate, so if you bring them back without reason, then you kind of insult the story which is as insulting to the audience as well as the film itself.  I think overall the taste I had left in my mouth from watching this was the greed of the producers saying let's make more money.

For over two decades we have been watching Dom's family evolve, overcome and win against the most outrageous odds... the series should change it's name to The Far Fetched & The Furious. 

Well that's my rant, but I'll probably still go what's the remaining sequels hoping the writers rectify what they did wrong, kind of like what X-Men Days of Future Past did for X-Men The Last Stand.  Also shout out to the writer's who are on strike in the USA entertainment needs your contributions desperately.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 8, 2023","I can always rely on this franchise to give me what I desire from it.

'Fast X' is a great time. I adore the whole series and have done so since watching the opening entry of it as a teen, sure it has changed tremendously since those halcyonic days of 2001 (OK, I was like 5 then...) but my fondness and enjoyment of these films remains unchanged - quality entertainment!

I love the main cast, particularly those we've had since the beginning or thereabouts - from Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez to Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris (I'm gonna need a spin-off with those two if you're reading, Universal!) to Sung Kang and Jordana Brewster (want more of the latter, but I get it's tricky with the absence of Paul Walker; who is still missed). I'll never tire (tyre?) of watching them together.

Away from those guys, the recurrence of the likes of Charlize Theron, John Cena and Nathalie Emmanuel is pleasant and the additions of Brie Larson and Jason Momoa are highly welcomed. I wasn't sure if Momoa was a bit too over the top in parts, but all in all he makes for a memorable antagonist - he certainly commits to the role!

The action continues to be absolutely bonkers and I continue to be absolutely onboard with everything and anything that is portrayed onscreen. The look of the film, the sound of the film... I dig it all to be honest. It's loud as heck, but that's exactly what I'd want from a 'Fast & Furious' flick. A film worth the admission fee, as usual.

Bring on 'Fast XI' or whatever they decide to call it. Apparently we're still getting another one after that, which I personally hope has its own sequel, which in turn has its sequel, followed by another seque... you get my point. I wanna be 105 and sat in the cinema watching another one of these.😂",POSITIVE

"Jun 8, 2023","With this being the tenth movie I think we all knew what to expect. Toretto pulling off the impossible in, you guessed it, a dodge charger. We did get the iconic drag race but it was short lived. Although it’s not about the racing, let’s be honest it never was, this one will leave you feeling even older than you did when you started it. You’ll realize how far you can get in a twenty year saga and still be glued to your seat wanting another twenty more.",POSITIVE

These are so awful, cringy, and ""over the top"" doesn't even begin to describe how bad the acting is. The stunts are so absolutely unbelievable I can't even suspend my disbelief to just enjoy the action. More power to you if you like these, but yeesh... It's bad, really bad. More of the same terrible crap in this franchise that had a promising early run of the first 3 movies, then made a u-turn to complete garbage.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 8, 2023",The movie bounces around too much and at times didn't make any sense. The actions scenes were too off the wall to be even possible. If you are bored and have nothing else to do then go and watch. But if there is a better movie playing go see that one.,NEGATIVE

"Jun 7, 2023",The movie was so awesome!  I was going to pass until I saw all of the positive consumer reviews!  Definitely one of my favorite since Fast 5. They really took time to reconnect with each character which is why I love the franchise so much since Fast 5.  They veered from that in 9 but recovered big time in this one which still had many eye-popping stunts and cool effects but the story went much deeper.  I loved it and highly recommend it!,POSITIVE

"Jun 7, 2023","This is the first fast and furious I've ever watched, I think it was a bit corny and I felt like they were trying to max out the action by having so many characters with alot of different scenes and every second something happens which is good but also feels like the target audience was 12 year olds who love cars and dont care about actual quality. like the scene where the kid and his uncle got into a commercials plane storage space to get into a small plane to fly away, or the fact that the fighting scenes really resemble low cost WWE. Movie was good, seen worse. I would've gave it 3.5 starts but I expected alot more from the directors.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 7, 2023","The latest instalment of the Fast and Furious franchise, ""Fast X,"" takes the series to new heights of absurdity and ridiculousness. The days of street racing are long gone, replaced with spy-thriller superhero-like adventures that feature villains reminiscent of James Bond and Mission Impossible. This tenth movie in the 22-year-long franchise delivers more of what its predecessors have been serving up, with a finale that ups the thrills and brings back everyone who has appeared in the series and introduces new characters.

The film centres on the theme of, say it with me: FAMILY. The film doesn't have any subtext; characters say what they will do before they do it, providing some comic relief from the severe high-octane action. The movie opens with recycled footage from the fifth instalment, ""Fast Five,"" and somehow inserts Jason Momoa's character into it, suggesting that the director believes ""Fast Five"" was the last best film in the series. The antagonist of ""Fast Five,"" who had a son named Dante Reyes, is back for revenge. Over the past decade, he has been plotting his vengeance against Dominic Torretto, played by Vin Diesel. Cipher, played by Charlize Theron, appears at Dom's house injured and informs him of the imminent threat. Cipher has just fought her men who turned against her and knows that Dante is no ordinary villain. Using the ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" trope, everyone, good and bad, teams up to take down this sociopathic, Heath Ledger's-Joker-like villain.

Their globe-trotting hunt takes them to Rome, where they fall into a trap set by Dante. A mission involving computer chips turns out to be a bomb, causing the team to become fugitives after they try to minimise casualties. Letty is caught and sent to a black site with Cipher while the agency is replaced by a new head, Aimes, who doesn't see eye to eye with the ""family."" Brie Larson joins the cast as Mr Nobody's daughter and assists the team. As the film progresses, more characters are introduced, from Jason Statham and Helen Mirren to Pete Davidson! The newcomers are solid additions, with Daniela Melchior providing a neat blast into the past and Alan Ritchson playing a double spy naturally. However, with such a large ensemble cast, some characters' roles are inevitably reduced or made negligible, but this is not true for the antagonist.

Jason Momoa plays Dante, a maniacal man willing to level cities to exact his revenge. Dressed in colourful outfits with a deranged personality, Dante plays the villain, knowing he will somehow be a part of the family eventually. He is not wrong, as seen with Cipher and Jakob. One comically unsettling scene shows him putting on nail polish and saying he has to ""tone down masculinity."" With the technology he has obtained from Cipher and his meticulously planned revenge over a decade, Dante is probably the most frightening and intimidating villain in the franchise.

Dante's revenge plan involves many cars and explosions, with each action sequence escalating rapidly and defying physics. The final dam scene is goofy, foolish, and nonsensical, but that's okay because the franchise has made it a norm. The movie doesn't end with a family barbecue, as the previous films have, but ends abruptly after 140 minutes. This is because ""Fast X"" is the beginning of the end, the start of a final trilogy to the Fast and Furious franchise.

In short, ""Fast X"" has all the familiar elements: cars, explosions, over-the-top action sequences, and a diverse ensemble cast. The film stays true to its themes of family and loyalty, and the villains are as dramatic as ever. With almost two and a half hours of pure entertainment and adrenaline rush, it's an excellent watch for franchise fans and those who enjoy mindless action flicks with some laughs. The franchise has genuinely evolved but ultimately, it still knows how to deliver what its fans want.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 7, 2023","This movie is purely made for entertainment, people often tend to forget that most of the movies are made for entertainment, yes the story is not that good, action scenes are more grounded and somewhat realistic in this movie. Villain actually made sense. This movie is getting a bit too much hate IMO. Its a fun movie to watch with your friends and ofcourse FAMILY. This movie is better than previous 2 ones",POSITIVE

"Jun 7, 2023","When I watch any movie from this series I turn into a little kid again. Action movies are always pow and bam and wow. The Fast series has turned into something bigger than it originally was. Now it’s so ridiculous with explosions and defying stunts in addition to the cool vroom of every car in the movie. Ridiculous in the good way. The movie was sooo entertaining. Dante had to be my favorite character, he was so flamboyantly  unhinged and playful in his villain that I lit up every time he was on the screen. Okay thanks bye.",POSITIVE

"Jun 7, 2023",I've only seen the first 2 so I'm not a big fan of the franchise. The difference between the first ones and his are huge. It's over the top for sure and I dig it. The best part of this movie is Jason Momoa. It's basically his debut as the Joker and he's amazing.,POSITIVE

"Jun 7, 2023","In my opinion this is the best Fast movie probably since the unfortunate passing of Paul Walker. While there are some moments that are like ""c'mon"" most of the movie is pretty good. Vin Diesel does usual superhero like things. John Cena probably has his best performance yet and there are some twists that catch you off guard. There is both good and bad regarding Jason Momoa as the villian but I am excited what he delivers in the next two films. And make sure you stay for the end credit scene because it is a good one. Overall like most Fast films it is filled with action and was overall a fun movie",POSITIVE
"Jun 7, 2023","The movie was super hyped up and the story just really didn't match. Yes lots of action but it really fell flat and I know that they laid it out for another movie but now I am thinking I am done with these movies.

"Jun 6, 2023",Performing of Jason Momoa was the Best of the movie,NEUTRAL
"Jun 6, 2023","Better than Fast 8-9 but about 30 minutes too long. Momoa saves what otherwise would've been mediocre, but a lot of the settings and set pieces felt too much like rehashes of past Fast films.

The characters get split up early and spend most of the runtime apart, either alone or in 2-3 character sub groups. This works better in some cases than others, and John Cena was fun but also a complete 180 from his character in Fast 9. 

Overall, like the last few, it's still just a bunch of big set pieces connected by a weak plot, so either you like these movies and will probably enjoy it, or you don't and will see it as a waste of time.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 6, 2023","for the love of all that is good and holy, this movie was bad. here's the thing, I dont expect much from the fast franchise. the story has been bad since 6, but this movie wasn't even enjoyable. they completely ignored any continuity from this same movie for a quick forced joke or gasp moment. and they're still trying to make the series make sense, and I don't even get how they think it's possible. I look for the good in movies. Even if it's not some deep story, it can still be enjoyable. but this movie wasn't even that, even thinking of it like a fast and the furious movie. there were so many times I legit thought they used the movements of the transformers ride in universal studios in the movie with just a cgi car. like u know this series doesn't like to think of physics, but this was an extreme version even compared to the rest of the movies. and the action wasn't even that good. my girl's brother fell asleep like halfway through. 
this is gonna be my only SPOILER!!!
obviously, I wasn't a fan, but I didn't straight up hate this movie until it ended on a cliffhanger. two more specifically, but they really want a sequel??? why??? this movie was LONG, and they still want a second part. this has got to stop. especially since Vin diesel says its for the late Paul walker. pretty sure he guilt tripped the rock into coming back for these movies using his name.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 6, 2023",This was such an awful movie. I wanted to walk out within the 1st 30 min. It just kept getting worse and worse. There were so many unbelievable things done with cars that it felt like a team of 6 year old boys playing with Hot Wheels were the creative minds behind this movie.,NEGATIVE

"Jun 5, 2023","Fast X, the latest installment in the Fast and Furious franchise, delivers the high-octane action and adrenaline-pumping stunts that fans have come to expect. The film showcases jaw-dropping car chases, explosive set pieces, and a star-studded cast, creating an entertaining experience. However, while it succeeds in delivering thrills, there are areas where Fast X could have improved to elevate the overall film.

The action sequences in Fast X are undeniably impressive. The car chases are visually stunning, and the stunts are mind-boggling, showcasing the ingenuity and technical prowess of the filmmaking team. The film's relentless pace keeps the energy high, making it an engaging watch for fans of the franchise's action-packed formula.

The ensemble cast, led by the charismatic Vin Diesel, delivers solid performances and keeps the chemistry between the characters alive. The return of familiar faces and the introduction of new additions add variety to the cast dynamic, providing some enjoyable moments and interactions. The film's commitment to diversity and inclusion is also commendable, as it showcases a range of talented actors from different backgrounds.

However, Fast X falls short in terms of narrative depth and character development. The storyline feels formulaic and predictable, lacking the emotional stakes and depth that would have elevated the film beyond just a series of thrilling action sequences. While the franchise has always been known for its over-the-top spectacle, a stronger emphasis on story and character arcs would have added a layer of substance and resonance to the film.

Another area where the film could have improved is in its editing and pacing. Certain scenes feel rushed, hindering the audience's ability to fully appreciate the intricacies of the action and follow the plot developments. A more balanced approach to the editing process would have allowed for better cohesion between the fast-paced action and the storytelling.

Additionally, the film's reliance on CGI at times detracts from the authenticity and practicality that made the earlier entries in the franchise so thrilling. While the visual effects are generally well-executed, a greater emphasis on practical stunt work and realistic physics would have enhanced the overall immersion and visceral impact of the action sequences.

In summary, Fast X delivers on its promise of high-octane action and a star-studded cast. The film's breathtaking stunts and impressive visuals provide an entertaining experience for fans of the franchise. However, it falls short in terms of narrative depth, character development, and editing, preventing it from reaching its full potential. Despite its flaws, Fast X still manages to deliver an enjoyable thrill ride for those seeking an adrenaline-fueled escape.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 5, 2023","The movie, as usual, has many ""liar"" action scenes, ok... But the drama is akward. And the context in the countries where the history rolls... Zero previous research. Specially in Brazil. Dear god, ""Hernan Reyes""... We speak Portuguese! Fernando Reis, ok, it woul be a normal name. ""Dante""?... it's uncommon. The songs? The wear... The cars... Sprint race? The car is Gol, with AP motor, and an insane pressure of turbo... Or an Opala... Summary, very bad.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 5, 2023",This movie has literally raised the bar since the last VIllian. Jason Mamoa was simple Excellent in his performance. The comedy sequences mixed with Action packed scenes tied in perfectly and really set the tone for Part 2 and 3. Looking forward for the next one.,POSITIVE
"Jun 5, 2023",It's  a franchise that keeps giving what it's meant to give. The plot twists and actions in this movie were superb. the new villain is a great boost to this movie franchise. The movie was all around great from the beginning to the Post credit scene.,POSITIVE

"Jun 5, 2023","It's surprisingly refreshing every time that Jason Momoa is on screen, he is a great villain for an otherwise dreadfully boring movie. If fast and furious nine hadn't convinced you that this franchise was in the dump then Fast X sure gives you a whole new reason why! This movie is so astoundingly bad for this franchise it's funny.

Fast X is a thrilling two-hour, 21-minute ride that takes you across multiple cities, from Los Angeles to Rome, Rio, Portugal, and London. Director Louis Leterrier makes the most of his budget, delivering exhilarating action scenes like a bomb bouncing through the streets of Rome and a massive vault being dragged through Rio. While it doesn't reach the same level of outlandishness as Fast 9's space stunt, the film still packs a punch. The story kicks off with a gripping flashback, pulling Dominic Toretto out of his peaceful life and into a collision with the vengeful Dante Reyes, son of a drug lord. Jason Momoa injects the film with a burst of energy, bringing a unique and intense performance. After over 20 years, the cast may not be as fast or furious, but Momoa's presence revitalizes the sequel.",POSITIVE

"Jun 4, 2023","Title of the review: ""Fast & Furious 10: A Worn-Out Formula that Fails to Deliver Freshness""

Since its original release over two decades ago, the ""Fast & Furious"" saga has been known for its high-octane action, epic chase scenes, and charismatic cast. However, with its tenth installment, titled ""Fast & Furious 10,"" it becomes clear that the formula has lost much of its original shine. This film is a perfect example of how a franchise can wear thin and lose its sense of novelty and excitement.

Directed by Louis Leterrier, known for his work in other action films, ""Fast & Furious 10"" promised to be a triumphant return to the roots of the franchise and an opportunity to revitalize it. However, what we find on screen is a collage of clichés and predictable situations that barely manage to hold the viewer's interest.

The cast, composed of famous names like Vin Diesel, Jason Momoa, Jason Statham, and Michelle Rodriguez, cannot rescue the film from its messy and predictable script. While each of them does their best with the characters they are given, their performances are not enough to compensate for the lack of character development and uninspired dialogue.

The biggest problem with ""Fast & Furious 10"" lies in its desperate attempt to surpass the action sequences of previous installments. Instead of offering something new and exciting, the driving sequences and vehicle confrontations feel repetitive and exaggerated to the point of disbelief. It seems that the franchise has lost the balance between action and coherence, sacrificing logic in the name of spectacle.

Furthermore, the excessive runtime of the film, at 141 minutes, only contributes to making the experience more exhausting. As the plot drags on, viewers are forced to endure unnecessary subplots and underdeveloped secondary characters that don't add anything meaningful to the main story.

In summary, ""Fast & Furious 10"" is a clear example of a saga that has lost its shine. With a predictable plot, shallow characters, and over-the-top action sequences, the film becomes a tired and worn-out exercise of what used to be an exciting franchise. While die-hard fans of the series may find some moments of entertainment, those seeking a fresh and stimulating cinematic experience will be disappointed. It is time for the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise to rethink its approach and find a new direction if it wants to remain relevant in the landscape of action cinema.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 4, 2023","Undoubtedly the best film in the saga after the 5th and 7th. Much funnier than the 9th chapter, and also more realistic, there are the usual over-the-top action scenes (I would have been disappointed if there weren't) but at least it doesn't take Roman and Tej into space. The Infinity War-like structure works so much because you don't notice the (relatively) long duration thanks to characters being split into multiple groups, fast-paced action scenes, the new ultimate villain and a pending ending for part 2. Vin Diesel seems to be the only one taking himself seriously, and this also works. Jason Momoa is basically a Joker version, John Cena is Peacemaker, and new and returning characters played by Brie Larson, Daniela Melchior and Jason Statham are all great and I would have liked to see more of them.",POSITIVE
"Jun 4, 2023","Too much of a setup for the next one? Nice flashbacks though. Pairing Letty & Cipher confusing, guess TBD. Didn't Mia and Bryan have 2 kids (frolicking on the beach in a previous film that was Paul Walker's last appearance) What happened to them? Or are they in an undisclosed location with Bryan?",NEUTRAL

Yes, in some shape or form the movies are always basically the same but that's what makes it so great and you can't even be mad at it. The saga never fails to disappoint and will give you everything you'd expect for a fast film. The fact that they cameoed every single character possible into the movie was just pure gold and  hilarious. Definitely enjoyed this and look forward to part two.",POSITIVE

"Jun 4, 2023","Fast X is the tenth and second-last installment in the Fast & Furious franchise, which has thrilled fans with its action-packed and heartfelt stories for over two decades. The film is directed by Louis Leterrier, who replaced Justin Lin due to creative conflicts. It follows Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew as they face their most formidable foe yet: Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the son of a drug lord they killed in Fast Five.

The film is a love letter to the loyal fans of the franchise, as it revisits and honors many of the previous films and characters. It also features an amazing cast of old and new stars, including Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Jason Statham, Charlize Theron, and more.

Fast X delivers what it promises: stunning stunts, exotic locations, fast cars, and witty banter. The film takes the action to a new height, with scenes that defy the laws of physics and logic. The film also pays homage to its roots by referencing or recreating some of the most iconic moments from the series.

However, the film also has some drawbacks that weaken its impact as the series' climax. The plot is complicated and implausible, relying on too many coincidental and illogical twists. The dialogue is corny and repetitive, with Dom constantly lecturing about family and loyalty. The action scenes are exaggerated and unrealistic. The film's duration is too long, dragging for more than two hours without much variation or surprise.

The film also shines thanks to Jason Momoa's performance as Dante Reyes, who is a charismatic and ruthless villain. He brings a sense of danger and intensity to the role, making him a worthy adversary for Dom. He also has some emotional depth and motivation for his actions, as he blames Dom for destroying his family's legacy.

Fast X is a mixed bag of a movie that will please die-hard fans of the franchise but disappoint others who expect more from a blockbuster finale. It is a fun and flashy spectacle that delivers on action and star power but lacks story and logic. It is not the best or the worst of the series, but somewhere in between.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 4, 2023",It was worth watching to see all the well-know actors and actress of the FF franchise. Very interesting plot and the end was something phenominal. For sure there is FF 11 coming out sometime..,POSITIVE

"Jun 3, 2023","Fast paced, good story with an over the top, wacky expressive villain with cookie cutter over the top action sequences and explosions. You expect this in an action thriller. There were a few dull moments, but the story moved along quite nicely. Nothing you haven't seen before.

All the main characters from the previous movies were in play. All played their roles like troopers. Charlize Theron and Michelle Rodríguez got into a scuffle which was the only real fight scene in the whole movie. Hope to see more of Brie Larson kick some butt as Ms Nobody.

This cliff hanger set up the finale in the next installment. Don't know if they can stretch this into a 3 parter.

Overall I give it a 8.5/10. Not fantastic, but not bad either. Would certainly see it on IMAX!!",POSITIVE

"Jun 3, 2023","Overall i liked the movie, plot was chaotic and it was intense almost all the way. But Jason's portay of the bad guy was so cringe. So many unnecessary scenes with him just trying to be comically and failing so hard. It just didn't fit the movie to have these completely different scenes where Jason was supose to be funny. Not gonna recommend it to anyone else and I'm not coming for the sequels.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 3, 2023","Despite Jason Momoa's underwhelming performance, I enjoyed Fast X. His chemistry with Vin Diesel was lacking, and his inconsistent and chaotic acting stood out as one of the weakest in the series. However, the action, while not as insane as previous films, still had enough moments to entertain and amuse me. The movie strikes a balance between acknowledging its own absurdity without going into parody, which I appreciated.

"Jun 3, 2023","It was the same as the last several fast.... movies. Blowing up cars, planes, buildings and on and on it goes. They even leave a nice cliffhanger for episode 11. Come on really!!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 3, 2023","A.It's very digital. The scenes you could see that they were digitally enhanced.  B.Jason Mamoa's character reminded me of The Joker in Batman. Little quirky, the odd personality of evil. Well done by Mamoa. I do think he should had been listed higher up of actors. Regardless of a posted statement, I read, saying Mamoa ""overacted"", he played it like i believe it was scripted, like Jim Carrey also plays the quirky odd characters. C. There are many drama parts in this movie. You have to keep track of who and where the characters are going. D. There were emotional sections of remembrance. E. As a Grandma, I believe 8yr olds could see this with parents. No vulgarity or nudity was overwhelming.  F. Stay after the credits. There's the hint of whats next. 
G.  I strongly advise, before seeing, have an overload movie night/weekend of all the FF series, in order because this one includes them in some way and you might get lost. (B1- I'm just a little prejudice for Mr. Momoa as I'm a Norwalkian of Iowa. So, Ill buy the dvd for that reason.) Enjoy this flick and don't forget the popcorn before it starts.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 3, 2023","Vamos todos entrar em um consenso (incluindo você Vin Diesel) de que Velozes e Furiosos ACABOU. Não tem mais oque ser contado sobre essa família enjoativa. Essa franquia simplesmente irá encontrar pelo em ovo em seu décimo primeiro filme. Em seu décimo segundo, com toda certeza, Vin Diesel explorara o multiverso. São personagens que não morrem, como disse certa vez uma jovem sábia : Precisamos matar os personagens, como fazem em Game of Thrones. Sou brasileira e eu odeio como os filmes estrangeiros representam o Brasil, onde os atores e atrizes são mais espanhóis e mexicanos do que brasileiros.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 3, 2023","It's better than the last few installments. It's clearly setting up for part two, so you have to take story build into consideration. Jason Momoa is in a league of his own with Dante. I'm glad we're getting a few movies with this character because watching Jason's villain makes you wonder where he's been this whole series. Momoa alone is worth seeing the movie. However, if you like fun in general, and have liked the past movies for the joy of them, it's worth the ticket admission too.",POSITIVE

"Jun 3, 2023",Out of all the Furious movies I think this one is the best. It kept me on the end of my seat during the entire movie. But that ending though wasn't ready. Normally you get some closer at the end of the movie but not this time. Everything is left up in the air that you have to wait for the next movie in order for all your questions to be answered.  But one thing I loved was Jason Moana...he played his part to a T! Can't wait for the next installment,POSITIVE
"Jun 3, 2023","nonstop action & the villain was perfect, but could've used a different actor cause Jason Momoa over acted the hell out of that movie.",POSITIVE
"Jun 3, 2023","Money well spent.   To all the nerdy haters.   No, its not entirely realistic.   But sometimes you need that.  It's an escape.   The cast, explosions, fight scenes, etc are fun and entertaining.   If it's not your cup of tea.   Maybe you should go watch the cartoon spider verse or Little Mermaid.  Id watch it again..",POSITIVE

"Jun 2, 2023","This one was the worst. This Franchise so desperately needs a mercy-kill. The Fast franchise we all knew and loved no longer bares a soul and what we get now is a money grabbing machine. The second-hand embarrassment is palpable scene after scene. Littered with terrible one liners that make cheesy 80s movies look Oscar worthy, the best only relief you get are thanks to Jason Momoa and nothing else.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 2, 2023",Captivating and hilarious. It has everything that made you first love the franchise and more. Someone has been paid a lot of money to bad mouth this movie. Dominic Toretto does not have superpowers. He simply has a moment where out of adrenaline he lifts a car that lives itself as soon as it is rocked forward a little bit. Would see you again and again and again.,POSITIVE

"Jun 2, 2023","Oh lord , my main question is why ?",NEGATIVE
"Jun 2, 2023","Fast X is a high-octane, globe-trotting spectacle filled with thrilling action sequences. Director Louis Leterrier maximizes the film's budget, delivering jaw-dropping moments like a bomb bouncing through the streets of Rome and a gigantic vault being dragged through Rio. While not as outlandish as Fast 9, the film's intense plot reunites Dominic Toretto with an unhinged antagonist, played energetically by Jason Momoa. Despite the recurring cast showing signs of fatigue, Momoa injects the sequel with a refreshing burst of energy.",POSITIVE
"Jun 2, 2023",Fabulous.  have gone to see it 3 times!!,POSITIVE

"Jun 2, 2023","Too many unbelievable action scenes and the new ""bad guy"" was too creepy and flamboyant for me. I also didn't care for the choice of who lives and who dies at the end. I am a big fan of the Fast series, especially with Paul Walker, but this final episode left me disappointed.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 2, 2023","You can't expect a super excellent script out of a f&f saga but, what Jason momia does to his character it's just amazing, it's kinda controversial say that this movie it's bad and then say that the villain is amazing. Because all the story it's around him. So yea, all that thing about family and faith bla bla bla, but just put that on side and enjoy the movie 😮‍💨",NEUTRAL
"Jun 2, 2023","We're close to the end, but it can't end without having us on the edge of our seats like the other The Fast And The Furious films have done. This one is different compared to the Fast 9. Brings a whole new story that makes a bad guy like Dante the psychotic winner. I can't wait til Fast 11. This is it. Fast X is another big one with full speed ahead on display.",POSITIVE
"Jun 2, 2023","Unironically silly and cartoonish, cheesy dialogues and yet the worst scene was being able to reverse the anesthesia gas back into the vents to make them baddies pass out. Why did such a bypass exist? Why am I watching this?",NEGATIVE
"Jun 2, 2023","It's not good. Too frequently it tries to be serious making it unfun. 

When Vin Diesel is on screen its a bad time, but the supporting cast (especially Cena and Mamoa) make it worth a shot for those familiar with the franchise.",NEGATIVE

So going into this one I had no expectations. , Just grabbed my snacks and treat it like it is .. a popcorn movie. Check your brain at the door and have fun with it , kind of like Sharknado with cars .  Jason Momoa was a crazy joker-esk blast , He completely made the movie.  So go in sit back and watch the tornado hit the trailer park.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 2, 2023","I read Vin Diesel blames Jason Mamoa's over acting for negative reviews, Mamoa is what got me to the cinema to watch it in the first place and found his performance the best part of the film, the rest of the cast were mainly boring, except maybe Cena, Diesel was the worst.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 2, 2023","This is one of the better movies in the Fast and Furious franchise. The movie looks like money too! The locations, the cars- oh and the overall style! The stylist for the actors need an Oscar nod. The storyline is perfectly set up too. Definitely a must see!",POSITIVE

"Jun 2, 2023","An atrocious, over-the-top, melodramatic, & loaded action flick that doesn’t know when to press the brakes. Entertaining? Yes, but left no room to breathe from camera shots. The lack of reality makes this unbearable to attach any emotions. I had to pull out the alcohol.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 2, 2023",I gave this franchise one more chance and I wasted 2+ hours of my life. So sad for it to go out like this. ,NEGATIVE
"Jun 2, 2023",The action was great. The one arm car lift c'mon be real. The acting from Jason Momoa was all over the place. What was he trying to get across with it. It was like a weird flamboyant joker from Batman in the 50s. I expected better acting from such a professional actor. The rest of the movie was ok. The ending killed the series for me. Leave it at fast 9. Not worth it. There was some cool scenes with the rest of the crew but not enough to watch the whole movie for. Thanks for ruining my favorite movie series Momoa!

"Jun 1, 2023",Stupid and entertaining! That's is the best way to describe the latest movie of a series that should have ended a long time ago. It's way better than Fast 9. I really liked Momoa in the movie. It really looked like he had a lot of fun.,POSITIVE
"Jun 1, 2023","Felt like I was watching a video game, way to much CGI action.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 1, 2023","I'm a long-time fan of the FF movies, but this was a really long, drawn-out movie with poor CGI and half-baked acting, and it didn't feature any cool cars to balance the movie. I do not often want to give up on a movie, but this had me side-eyeing the exit door a few times. Had it not been for the horrifically priced nachos combo at Odeon I bought x2, I would have bailed.

FF7 was the pinnacle of the franchise and drift towards irrelevance is approaching quickly. More cars and fewer MI-style plots, please. Jason Mamoa was funny but the camp-jack-sparrow-butterfly-act didn't suit the level of malice he inflicted throughout the movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 1, 2023","I'm not sure it's good enough that I would recommend it but at this point you should know pretty well if the ""Fast"" franchise is for you or not. Jason Momoa provides a refreshing take on the villain role in flamboyant fashion and he's having a blast doing it which adds appeal. It's a continuation of one of the most outrageous movie franchises in cinematic history and regardless what you think you have to give it credit to how it started and where it is now. I can't think of any other franchise that created so much out of so little.

"Jun 1, 2023","Spoilers: 

I hate the fast and and furious films, but this one was a treat. The movie feels completely self aware and acts almost like a parody of itself. It's just incredible, I don't think I've enjoyed watching a film this much in a long time. Jason Mamoa absolutely steals the show, and I honestly don't think I could have recommended this movie if it weren't for him. This film is entirely incompetent which is what makes it so great. The movie ends on a cliffhanger and supposedly kills off half of the cast in the most hilarious and underwhelming ways imaginable.

"Jun 1, 2023","Vin Diesel y sus compañeros siguen trayendo más acción y emoción en esta secuela que ofrece una gran ola de acción y adrenalina sin frenos. Retomando lo visto en la quinta película, aquí Dominic Toretto enfrenta un gran desafío que pone en peligro a sus compañeros. Toda la película se convierte en una lucha contra un villano bastante excéntrico, pero letal. Vin Diesel sigue sorprendiendo como un héroe de acción y aquí se lo ve en su máximo esplendor. Entre el resto, Tyrese Gibson sigue siendo un buen alivio cómico, Michelle Rodríguez sigue siendo tan ruda como siempre, Charlize Theron aún logra ser una ingeniosa mujer fatal a pesar de su poca aparición, Jason Statham solo hace una mera introducción y sigue siendo asombroso a pesar de ello, John Cena es increíble luchando aunque es curioso que se haya reconciliado tan rápido con Vin Diesel y podría haber mostrado más, por último Jason Momoa se luce bastante siendo un antagonista caricaturesco y carismático. El montaje y las secuencias de acción son excelentes. La cantidad de efectos especiales usados ofrece toda una dosis de acción que asombra e impacta. Todas las persecuciones y explosiones hacen de esta película una excitante montaña rusa de entretenimiento, cien por ciento prometedor. Sin duda es una de las mejores entregas de la saga y el comienzo de lo que podría llegar a ser el gran final de esta saga. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 9/10.",POSITIVE
"Jun 1, 2023","Great action, great surprises....Jason Momoa was hilarious and insanely chaotic as the new villain. The team is going to put in all the stops to handle this fool cuz he did something that no villain has done: Left the movie on a cliffhanger!! Hyped to see how it all ends!! Family is forever!!",POSITIVE
"May 31, 2023","Special effects were excellent!!  Nice to see Little Brian grown up. Lots of action, sprinkled with some humor.
A good summer blockbuster film!!!",POSITIVE

"May 31, 2023","If you like over the top action, good fight scenes, etc then this movie is for you.  Really enjoyed it.  Not going to win any Academy awards for the acting but that is not what this movie is about.  I would definitely recommend it.",POSITIVE
"May 31, 2023","I enjoyed Fast X. Jason Momoa was the highlight for me. Wow, what a performance by him and the entire cast. I love the hand to hand combat fight scenes, especially the one between Letty and Cipher,that was epic and badass. I loved it! I love the cliffhanger aspect of it. It was perfect. It set it up for Fast 11. I'm very excited to see Fast 11, and I can't wait to see it.",POSITIVE
"May 31, 2023",Al principio me agrado por que tiene ese toque que tenian las anteriores pero como fue avanzado la pelicula ya se me hacia aburrido y el villano fue como si. Agarramos a el guasón a kang y a modok y los combinamos es divertido al principio pero odioso al final y lo interesante viene al final me quedaría  con las 10 peliculas de 11 que son,NEUTRAL
"May 31, 2023","I really enjoyed watching this movie, its the type to keep you on the edge of your seat because you really don't know what's going down. I'm not saying you should not watch this film I truly did enjoy this movie I enjoyed all the fast movies. Roman and Tej are absolutely hilarious just like always they never fail to make you laugh. Watching Dom trying to defeat someone makes you wanna get up out of your chair watching him trying that in fast x made me clinch my knuckles but at the end we know Dom never can be defeated. However the 1st (The Fast And Furious ) & the second ( 2 Fast 2 Furious ) were more about car racing, but besides that nothing will ever top the first fast. Fast & Furious went a little downhill when Paul walker ( Brian O'Connor ) passed away during fast 7. Real true fast fans know Fast & furious really did truly end after 7. The fast films are just not the same without Brian it just feels completely wrong. The energy of brotherhood is just not there without Dom's bestfriend (Brian ) they always kick butt together and Dom without Brian just feels completely wrong it breaks my heart. But however there is nothing the directors can do about that. I truly do love when they have mentioned his name in past films to keep his legacy alive which is heartwarming. I know for a fact the opening scene of Paul and Dom most certainly made me tear up tremendously there is nothing like brother hood, but what really made me cry was the scene in the garage when Dom looks at the pictures of Paul & etc. I truly hope the finale fast they find some way to bring Brian back even though he passed away. I might actually cry if they don't. I'm rooting for you Fast directors please do not disappoint us with the final fast!",NEUTRAL
"May 31, 2023",The movie was very nice and a lot of action if you like action movies its worth the money,POSITIVE
"May 31, 2023",It's a good flim a few flaws hopefully another one to tie up loose ends,NEUTRAL
"May 31, 2023",X is bringing closure to all the beloved characters in the movie franchise. Sadly Paul will not appear. ?,POSITIVE
"May 31, 2023","It's an ok movie. Lots of action, but too much jumping all over with the many different characters and plots, and only one of them came together at the end. The only bright spot ... Jason Momoa's character makes the movie. This series is getting farther and farther away from its origins, sad cause it could be so much better.",NEUTRAL
"May 31, 2023","While it seems to have reeled itself in from the nonsense that was Fast 9, ie; No Fieros in outer space this time), Fast X is by no means grounded.  There are no less than three scenes that simply required a hard eye roll and a suspension of belief in basic physics.   But hey, it's what we've come to expect from this quasi-sci-fi series. 
Aside from a surprisingly decent performance from Bri Larsen in a minor role, the true superstar of this movie was Mamoa. His psychotic blend of debauchery and humor was perfect for the villain's role.   Beyond that, the staple of ""the family"" has gotten more than mildly tiresome.  That said the pairing of Letty and Cipher towards the end of the movie was a nice change of pace.  Also the meme of ""saying family in two movies guarantees your return from the dead after three movies"" is apparently accurate as we see the return of Gisele for no particular reason as an ally of Cipher.  WTH? 

Overall it was entertaining, but not something that needs a rewatch right away.",NEUTRAL
"May 31, 2023",A fun ride. Big fan of Jason Momoa as the villain,NEUTRAL
"May 31, 2023","Jason Momoa's character is a mix of The Joker and a modern version of Capt. Jack Sparrow. But I did like the concept of going after each ""family member"" and not world domination (hence the one star). Each movie must have an ending, we know its a 3 part movie but don't end the movie with an explosion then roll credits. If you have no intensions of killing off Toretto's ""family"" then there is no reason to make this a 3 part movie!",NEGATIVE
"May 31, 2023",This was the best one of the franchise and I'm looking forward to next 2 of this saga. Prepare to have your mind blown. They making a billion easily !!!,POSITIVE
"May 31, 2023",great movie definitely worth the money to see it,POSITIVE

"May 31, 2023","The movie was the most disappointing Fast movie. Action was good but there were no story at all. Jason Mamoa did a fantastic job in the film, it reminds me of Heath Ledger's joker. Overall just disappointing.",NEGATIVE

"May 31, 2023","One of the better fast and furious entries, albeit a very looooong one. As usual, it's over the top with a complete disregard of physics, of course, but entertaining. Jason Mamoa shines in this movie, by far the best acting of his career. It's worth going to see for Mamoas performance alone.",NEUTRAL
"May 31, 2023",Really enjoyed the movie,POSITIVE
"May 31, 2023",As much as I love the actors I can't give good review.  This movie is a set up for another sequil. Ending was not an end. Lots of unrealistic stunts. I think a 13 year old may appreciate. But we were bored.,NEGATIVE
"May 31, 2023",This is not at all the movie in which you get to see good story and common sense.  Vehicles are falling from the sky in this and the actors do whatever they want but have the guts to get scratched. 😁,NEUTRAL

"May 31, 2023",Do not come in expecting an Oscar worthy film and stop comparing it to the original film. Great action movie but some cheesy CGI at times. Looks like they're setting up for a big finale!,POSITIVE

"May 31, 2023",if paul walker were alive the saga would end already,NEGATIVE
"May 31, 2023","I was very disappointed , beginning of the movie was like almost 15 minutes of an old movie and what's strange is every time Dom and Dante meet he doesn't even fight him All he does is negotiate or race ?? 
Crazy part is how Dom saved his son like What !!! Drift open the door and wala he's in the car again ? 
And after 2 hours it has to be continued? 
After all of that the story doesn't even have a point like the other movies did.",NEGATIVE
"May 31, 2023","Although, I have been a fan of this series since day one. FF9 was a turning point for me. It was the first time I was completely board and couldn't wait for it to end. I thought  to myself, I won't be seeing the next one in theaters. Jump ahead to present day and there wasn't much else still playing at my local theater. Afterall, movies leave and go to steaming in two weeks time. So, all that is left to see are one or two choices. I went ahead a saw Fast X. 

Fast X is only a slight improvement over the last one, I wasn't board, I left wanted to see the next one. But the mainstay characters are getting stale and only the cameos from bigger stars like Jason Statham, John Cena, etc. keep these film above water. And they really are just cameos now, who walk in and out of a scene or two, or a post credit scene. It's like a bate and switch when you put them on the poster. Jason Momoa was a good addition, but he is just doing his impression of the Joker, nothing new. 

As for a main crew, they are given very little to do except banter and it isn't fresh, much like this score.",NEGATIVE

"May 31, 2023","I enjoyed the movie, no matter how completely unrealistic the car scenes are. The Dodge brand will NEVER go out of business / style the way these cars defy the odds in this movie. I might mess around and go get me a Demon Charger tomorrow since I can stop bombs from rolling with it and avoid multiple building’s collapsing while launching up a ramp and perfectly contacting construction equipment aiding me in my stopping a bomb goal. If Torretto says “Family” slow and deep 1 more time , I’m going to run up to the theater screen w/scissors and run across the screen leaving a big gash. Jokes but I enjoyed the movie EVEN THOUGH …. They ended the movie in the middle of a scene like this is a Netflix show and episode 11 comes out the next Friday at midnight - I’ve only seen 1, 2, & X so I’m not sure how the other movies end - the way this 1 ended was ridiculous. I’m racking my brain trying to guess how it ends with bad guy Jason Momoa about to cause major damage - and the credits just show up ??!!! What are we doing here, get over yourselves and end the bleep bleep movie. Shaking My Head !!!",POSITIVE

"May 31, 2023","This film is even more out there than the others, and not in a good way, but Jason Momoa just made this movie for me. That is the only reason it is getting top marks. He was just incredible. I thought Jason Momoa was ok before as an actor, but I did love him in this film.",POSITIVE
"May 31, 2023","I've never left a single review on this website but this movie made me do it. I have watched every single fast and furious movie and some of them are good, this one though, Fast X - is the worst movie i have watched in the last few years. Everything from stolen jokes to unfinished ending makes you wanna get a refund. Even Dwayne Johnson left the movie even though he still appears there for 10 seconds. CJI is worse than in fast and furious 5, I don't know how that's possible. The movie is so predictable, for the first time ever I wanted to fall asleep in the theater. This is an embarrassment for all the actors and producers. One advice - stop making fast and furious movies.",NEGATIVE
"May 31, 2023",it was good got mixed reviews before watching it tho,POSITIVE
"May 31, 2023",High action and thriller scenes. The villain  is awesome!,POSITIVE
"May 31, 2023","Continuity errors, bad plot, bad dialog and crazy stupid action sequences. Still worth the price of a ticket for Momoa as Dante. He's officially my favorite villain of the franchise! I hear there are two more movies coming and I hope he's the Big Bad in both of them before they eventually kill him.",NEGATIVE

"May 31, 2023",Full throttle action throughout the entire movie!,POSITIVE
"May 31, 2023","A seemingly endless movie about a dysfunctional family whose members (some of them) have been killed off in other movies but miraculously appear in subsequent movies.  The story lines are all over the place, and it just seems like lazy writing.  Let's talk about the movie's antagonist, Jason Mamoa. What if I was to tell you that the Joker, Jack Sparrow, and the Genie from Aladdin had a metro baby?  Well that's Jason Mamoa's character all wrapped up into one.  I understand that the writers wanted some comic relief, but seriously went overboard on this villain.  There's nothing I like or dislike about him, which is the problem.  I only want Vinny the Diesel to stop him so that the movie will end, which unfortunately it doesn't.   There's a guaranteed fast eleven coming and I imagine everyone lives through that ending........I'm not gonna spoil and already rotten movie. (HOW DID HAN LUE SURVIVE THE CRASH IN TOKYO DRIFT? THE WORLD MAY NEVER KNOW)
 
I love watching big budget action films in the theater, but I think I'll skip Fast XI through XXV and watch them on FX (SEE WHAT I DID THERE?).",NEGATIVE

"May 31, 2023","I don’t know how we made it this far but we’re here. Years later, this franchise is still going strong. So my first reactions are it’s good. Not great, but good. It’s a soap opera with action and cars that’s managed to keep you around to find out what happens next. A lot of new characters. Lots of action. Story was not the greatest but it serves its purpose to set up the finale. Last thing.. This needs to end. This movie was good, but it’s time. ",NEUTRAL

"May 31, 2023","I have followed the series as a die hard fan since day one but I must say this movie was an atrocity! Things just got more ridiculous after Paul walker passed. Dons a mathematical genius and plays pool with cranes, dodge charger get launched 100's of feet into a wall…falls another 50ft and still drives, defying physics/gravity and magically driving down the Hoover damn, bad guy armored vehicles sliding for miles as if on a water slide but when their armored vehicle flips and slides it's the logical distance.

"May 31, 2023","I’m so angry… I had a joke all planned out for when I inevitably hated this movie… but little did I know… I would actually end of loving it. 

But for my own fun, here is that review:

“For a movie that has a title that sounds like a laxative, the dump I squeezed out prior (to showtime) had more fast and furious tendencies than the movie itself.”               
Fast X is easily the best since Furious 7. Despite having absurdly “superhero-like” moments… the movie somehow feels a lot more grounded like in a Fast Five kind of way. I also feel that the Fast and Furious films are as good as their villains… and Jason Mamoa brings an refreshing energy that I have not felt since Statham joined in Furious 7 (I’d argue Cena is a great edition to the series, but I prefer how they used him in this rather than F9). If this is the penultimate chapter, I cannot wait to see what’s to come in the final chapter… or… I guess maybe the penultimate chapter according to Diesel? Who cares… I’ll be there with my seatbelt Fast10’d.",POSITIVE
"May 31, 2023",We love how it keeps us entertained the entire time. It was a great movie! We enjoyed it as a family been watching since the beginning its always a surprise with the movies cant wait for the next!,POSITIVE
"May 31, 2023","At this point, that the Fast franchise has left behind any idea of reality and draws on ideas that the Mission Impossible and Avengers franchises rejected as too crazy.  With that expectation firmly in mind, if you liked the last few Fast movies, you'll like this one too.",POSITIVE

"May 30, 2023","It's about as bad as it gets, at least until the next chapter, but it will make a ton of money none-the-less.  Kudos to the real stars of this movie - the CGI and stunt team - that elevate the action sequences to absurdity.  All with no emotional investment because once again, nobody dies (or stays dead) in this series, except for obviously Walker who continues to be sorely missed.  Diesel has all the emotional range of a tree (Groot to be specific), and his shtick has run thin.  Yes, I paid to see it, i hate myself for it, but sure I will line up when the next one comes out...",NEGATIVE
"May 30, 2023","I'm dubbing this the Infinity War of F&F movies. It spends a lot of time rounding up characters and setting things up with a somewhat disappointing payoff. Without giving anything anyway, it's obvious that this is part one of at least one more movie. It makes a lot of the movie feel like meandering. However, it's still a smart choice to try and build on the franchise they already have, rather than introducing a whole bunch of new ideas like usual. 

If you're just here for the cars and explosions, you'll find them, though it's obvious that they're holding back in favor of the next movie. There are some nice homages to the previous entries in the franchise, though the movie sours itself by pointing them out aggressively (do they assume the viewers of the F&F franchise are idiots? I'm offended).

Jason Momoa is shockingly fun. He's still tropey, but it's fresh for this franchise so it's better than usual. At least the whole cast looks like they're having fun. Unfortunately this movie shoots itself in the foot by being WAY too quippy to the point where it's actually kind of annoying to watch most of the scenes with Roman and Tej.

If this is Infinity War, then one can only hope that Endgame will follow soon and will hold absolutely nothing back.",NEUTRAL

"May 30, 2023","Talk about expanding your family then letting them die, and then the dead coming back to life. Well, that sums up what the Fast X family is all about. Other than that, Jason Mamoa's Joker-like performance was incredible. Too bad, it's too long that we'll have to wait for another Fast and Furious movie which might probably be called Fast X-2. Let's see who they will revive again in this franchise.",NEGATIVE

"May 30, 2023",Jason Momoa killed it!!!,POSITIVE
"May 30, 2023",Better than 9.  Momoa did good acting. Over the top.  5 mini movies within X is disjointed. They should just end these series.  Just a money grab.  Over the top CGI movie.,NEGATIVE
"May 30, 2023","I loved seeing all the favorite characters return, but they didn’t interact enough for me. I usually love all the stunts, but this movie has a lot. It may be just a little too much.

"May 30, 2023","Idk to think anymore 10 movies later when one of the main characters get super powers each movie since F&F 5. I guess I can suspend reality for a minute but with the first two you didn't need to suspend reality, exception is the last stunt in F&F2",NEUTRAL

"May 30, 2023",It was definitely action packed filled with twist and turns but at times it got a little tiring watching Jason Momoa behave and act like the joker!  I was hoping he would snap out of it and be the badass villain with a professional attitude thats a combo of the Equalizer and 007 but due to over confidence would eventually get what he deserves a Jokers ending,POSITIVE
"May 30, 2023",Absolute loved it!! The suspense was mind blowing! Cant wait for the next one,POSITIVE
"May 30, 2023","I actually like this one better than some of the previous movies.  I feel like there is more character development and it was a tad deeper than a few of its predecessors.   Also now way interested to see how Gisele and Hobbs play into the cliff hanger.  Jason Momoa was absolutely amazing in this film.  He is definitely the best Fast Villain to date, no argument.  He was funny while being absolutely frighteningly scary at the same time.  He nailed the ""socio-path"" bit.   The only thing that could get another half star for a Fast movie is if they were to bring in Brian for a last send off.  Of course if they do it wrong it could take away multiple stars...  Lets see what Fast 11 has in store!  :-)",POSITIVE
"May 30, 2023",Nothing spectacular about this movie at all and the ending. Absolutely sucks.,NEGATIVE
"May 30, 2023","I like that the team had to rely on ol' fashioned smarts, grit, and brawn in this one.  Jason Momoa was a nice touch, but it seemed he was a tad over the top. Perhaps you needed an over the top villain for Dom and his team! Looking forward to the next installment with BIG hopes for a Dante-Hobbs showdown!!!",POSITIVE
"May 30, 2023",The unrealistic stuff is getting old. Storyline had potential but the ridiculous stunts etc made it stupid.,NEGATIVE

"May 30, 2023",It was so much fun and made all these connections to past movies in the series.,POSITIVE
"May 30, 2023",One of the worst fast furious movies i have seen and i'm a big fan. Movie was 2:30 hours and i feel i walked away at the end like i just finished a episode of a show. Just leave the viewer hanging like that… wont even comment about how unrealistic stunts and story is getting but that was the trend with past ones.,NEGATIVE
"May 30, 2023",Dante was a boring antagonist. The movie felt like 3 different side stories barely linked together.,NEGATIVE
"May 30, 2023",Very entertaining and pleasantly surprised.  Hubby and I liked it!,POSITIVE
"May 30, 2023","Definitely not the best and is very much a part 1 to either a duology or trilogy. The family is back together and slowly being torn apart!

"May 30, 2023",2+ hours of explosions and improbable driving. A good escape but excessive as well.,NEUTRAL
"May 30, 2023",It was a typical Fast and Furious movie with lots of action and far fetched moves.  But I think it is well worth seeing on the big screen to get the full effect.  I would definitely recommend it.,NEUTRAL
"May 30, 2023",This was horrifying silly. F&F continues to get more ridiculous. I'm a fan of Alan Ritchson and was horrified to see him stope to this level. The fact people continue to support this is sad and a horrible state of the lack of intellect this work now holds.,NEGATIVE
"May 30, 2023",Jason Momoa was fantastic in this! I will most definitely be watching this movie again.,POSITIVE

"May 30, 2023","It's slightly more realistic than the previous one... But what did I say? forget all fundamentals about physics, gravity, fragility of the human body, and resistance of cars.

It can be enjoyed, it can amuse you, but it is implausible, it is.",NEUTRAL
"May 30, 2023","Menos grandioso que os anteriores, a franquia já começa a mostrar sinais de desgaste, tendo que usar de vários artificios para tentar surpreender o público.

"May 30, 2023","The movie was exciting in the beginning and then it got stale in the middle. By the time the son was kidnapped, it ended abruptly and we found out there are 2 more movies for this franchise.

Next bright idea please,NEUTRAL
"May 30, 2023",Movie is pretty good and the new addition of this villain is probably the best. Excited for the next parts. Looks like there’s gonna be a part 2 and 3,POSITIVE
"May 30, 2023","""Fast X: A Convoluted Ride Hindered by Overcrowded Characterization and Missed Emotional Opportunities""

Rating: 2/5 stars

""Fast X"" speeds onto the screen with a whirlwind of high-octane action, but its convoluted storytelling and crowded character development detract from the overall experience. While the film showcases standout performances by Jason Momoa and John Cena, it fails to strike a balance between character moments and a cohesive narrative, leaving emotional depth in its wake.

One of the film's major shortcomings lies in its convoluted plot, weighed down by an excessive number of side stories. It often feels as though the movie is more interested in introducing and applauding each character than weaving them into a satisfying and coherent narrative. The result is an elongated TV episode that struggles to tell a proper story, leaving viewers longing for a more focused and engaging experience.

Amidst the chaos, Jason Momoa's performance as the villain shines as a delightful and gleeful standout. His portrayal injects much-needed energy into the film, but it can't fully compensate for the uninteresting treatment of previous villains and the downplayed emotional moments from earlier installments. The film's attempt to uplift Momoa's character at the expense of these crucial elements diminishes the impact of what came before, leaving fans yearning for a more balanced and respectful continuation of the franchise's established emotional resonance.

Furthermore, the overcrowding of character moments leaves little room for the ensemble cast to breathe. While John Cena's character and sub-plot are highlighted as another positive aspect of the film, the predictability leading up to these moments undermines their impact. The film's eagerness to give each character a moment of their own sacrifices the opportunity for genuine character development, leaving some feeling underutilized and the overall narrative feeling disjointed.

Despite its flaws, ""Fast X"" still delivers exhilarating action sequences and impressive visual effects. The adrenaline-fueled spectacle and the charismatic presence of the cast provide moments of excitement and entertainment. However, these highlights are overshadowed by the film's failure to strike a cohesive balance between its characters, storylines, and emotional resonance.

In conclusion, ""Fast X"" struggles to find its footing amidst its convoluted storytelling and overcrowded character moments. While standout performances by Jason Momoa and John Cena add sparks of brilliance, the film falls short in honoring the emotional depth of previous installments and fails to give its ensemble cast the breathing room they deserve. Die-hard fans may find elements to enjoy, but for those seeking a well-crafted and emotionally resonant experience, ""Fast X"" fails to live up to its predecessors.",NEGATIVE

"May 29, 2023","Insane, ridiculous, wild, yet fun. The stunts and action scenes were quite literally flabbergasting. Every time I see a new Fast and Furious movie, I never think they can outdo the last movie with the stunts, yet, they always somehow do.

My only problem was that there was so much action, it got a bit boring at some points. Though, I still remained entertained. Jason Momoa's character was especially hilarious and cruel at the same time. Can't wait for the next one!",POSITIVE

Sorry not sorry, it ust didn't hit the mark.",NEGATIVE
"May 29, 2023","Cada escena fue un ¿Qué está pasando?! ¿Cómo es posible este suceso?!! Jajaja Tantos momentos que ni en mis mejores sueños me sucedería.

Pero pese a todo, cumple con su objetivo, es decir, es una película de acción, con autos, y explosiones, muchas explosiones. ¿Qué más esperas de una película de este tipo? ¿Una gran historia? Claro que no! Uno va al cine para ver peleas, carreras y explosiones.

Jason Momoa hace un gran trabajo como el villano, claro no es ni será un villano memorable, pero cumple con las escenas de acción. Hay mucho que criticar, muchos comentarios negativos, pero para que, esta película no va para el oscar, va para conseguir billetes, y con ese objetivo se mete al público en el bolsillo.

Si no quieres pensar, y solo quieres reír y explosiones muy locas, mira Fast X, cumple con lo que promete. No lo pienses mucho, es lo que es, ni más ni menos. Solo una película de acción, autos y explosiones. Y que viva la familia.

Como última recomendación, no le busques la lógica, no la encontrarás, solo disfrútala, y ten fe.",NEGATIVE

"May 29, 2023",Knowing That I've been a huge Fast and furious fan since I was 12 and then 13 I really did quite enjoy this movie but one fact that I don't get is why assume it's the last movie when the villain ain't never die but the last period (Jakob's death) really did crush me knowing that he is obviously one of my favorite characters because of John cena one of my favorite wrestling stars since I was little but anyway this movie deserves probably a 80%.

"May 29, 2023","Fast X Movie Review – gasoline powered soap opera struggles to find the exit 
(Spoiler Free)

Fast X (still should have been called Fast-10 Your seatbelts) is the latest installment in the Fast & Furious Franchise and it is a car wreck.

Fast X rides down the tarmac; engines howling and tires squealing, offering a transfixing spectacle, but it does not tell us why we should care about the driver or his crew. The franchise that famously doubles down on Family refuses to provide screentime to flesh out their characters, inevitably splintering the viewer's emotional attachment to Dom's crew.

Enter Dante Reyes, son of the baddie from Fast Five (2011), manic over revenge for his slain father and the theft of his ill-gotten fortune. Over the course of many brain-numbing action set-pieces Dante tries to scratch his proverbial itch 	with his manicured lavender-shaded fingernails. 

Topping the action set-pieces of the F&F predecessor flicks is a tough act and FAST X proves it. On one occasion, Dom uses his buffed-out Charger and a swiveling crane to pinball a trundling spherical time-bomb away from the Italian landscape and into a river. Such grotesque and needlessly complicated feats of live-action anime dull one's senses as realization sets in that there is no emotional weight to up the ante. Fear not viewer; death is but a pit-stop in these flicks, pending contractual negotiations.

Weirdly enough, for a franchise centered around vehicular mayhem, Fast X parades around too many hand-to-hand combat sequences to one's liking. 
The movie splits up the gang who then proceed to go on separate quests; thereby rupturing its narrative flow. For example: as Letty and Cipher are about to finish up their story arc, Fast X opts to teleport over to someone else; after a short while this shtick gets old and annoying, courtesy the quarter mile long cast list.

Fast X cramps in more folks than a minivan on a pilgrimage, with the likes of Vin Diesel; back with his signature mumble-growl, Michelle Rodriguez, Ludacris, Tyrese Gibson, Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, and many more glorified cameos. John Cena, as Toretto's long lost brother Jakob, stands out in particular; thanks to his natural charisma and comedic timing. 

For all its faults, Fast X pleases all: a fleeting glimpse of a loud roadside hoarding that manages to make you snort at its comic absurdity before it recedes in your rearview mirror in a popcorn scented afterimage.",NEUTRAL
"May 29, 2023","Loads of action and witty quips with attempts of family lessons. But stunts and CGI are so past the point of impressing, plus with an added feature of resurrecting long thought dead characters. 
Its not Gone with the Wind, but we all know that, go see the film for what it is and what weve come to expect.",NEUTRAL
"May 29, 2023","honestly I think the movie was good, but some scenes were kinda off but overall good movie.",NEUTRAL
"May 29, 2023",Action packed from the very beginning.  I loved how they are incorporating all old characters.,POSITIVE
"May 29, 2023",Action from beginning to end! Jason Mamoa made an excellent villain!,POSITIVE
"May 29, 2023",It's a fun popcorn movie. The more far fetched the funnier it is. Don't take it seriously.,POSITIVE
"May 29, 2023","Well, it reminded me of a mini series,  they just add different characters to fill the time. Gota say though it was a Allstar cast. 
But didn't really go anywhere.  Of course,  plenty of action. I paid 10 bucks matinee price and was entertained. All I really can expect.",NEUTRAL
"May 29, 2023",Corny as hell SMH unrealistic things going on like Vin lifting a car with 1 hand! And the ending?  Ooohhh let's talk about it...I HATE sitting thru a movie.. especially 1 I paid 2 see..& the ending SUCKS!!!,NEGATIVE
"May 29, 2023",Did not disappoint! Jason Mamoa is a great addition to the cast of characters!,POSITIVE
"May 29, 2023",Awesome. Can’t wait for the second one.,POSITIVE
"May 29, 2023",Great movie full of fast cars action and lots of off your seats scene.,POSITIVE
"May 29, 2023","I don't know what say about Fast X. But this film was very fun to watch. Best cast and villain.
I didn't know the Rock was going to be in the film because I heard the rock and Vin diesel aren't friends any more. That is wow to see the rock still in the film.",POSITIVE
"May 29, 2023",There is alot of family in this movie,POSITIVE
"May 29, 2023","Over the TOP! The most action packed so far of all the series. Leaves you wanting to see the next installment to see who/how they survived. Can't wait to see Dwyane Johnson and how he fits in the next storyline. Loved seeing all the previous ""players"" of past featured in this one.",POSITIVE
"May 29, 2023","This franchise has consistently become more and more unrealistic and neglects all reality of death. Just go see if you like cars and actors that a sometimes funny. Jason Mamoa being a flamboyant super villian was a treat, really made the movie bearable.",NEGATIVE
"May 29, 2023",The franchise has always been kinda far fetched but atleast it had a good story line. The only good part was Jason's comedic relief.,NEGATIVE
"May 29, 2023","Being a Fast fan I have to say I was very sceptical about where this franchise was going. I was super disputed in Fast 8 but Fast 9 was decent. Fast X was greatly better. Jason Momoa's character honestly is what made this movie better in addition to John Cena. Jason's character takes the franchise into a different vibe and it works. The one thing I wish they would do or should have done is to kill off Paul's character. I loved Paul Walker, but continuing to dance around his character, especially considering the character that he was, is ridiculous. Bryan would not miss out on these major events and it's silly to keep dancing around the idea of his character still being around.",POSITIVE
"May 29, 2023",Not bad... it's not dissapointing but I am not impressed either. At least it has good action ;),POSITIVE
"May 29, 2023",One of the best in the franchise so far. Loved the action sequences. Jason Mamoa perfect performance introduced us to the greatest villain since fast and furious ever started. Can wait to see more,POSITIVE
"May 29, 2023","Caught it opening day. I'm a fan of the series, but this one fell ridiculously short. Yes we expect spectacular FX, but THIS one just didn't cut it. Essentially an FX film with some intercuts of human presence. If there is a shining star in any of this, it's Jason's seriocomical performance. The question now is...see the 2nd installment? Or not? The jury's out.",NEGATIVE
"May 29, 2023",I thought this movie was the most stupid movie I have seen in years.,NEGATIVE

"May 29, 2023","It was awesome, jam packed with action! Momoa did a great job in his villain role, and it was great to see everyone! Would see it again! Excited for next one!!!",POSITIVE
"May 29, 2023","I'm not a fan of the franchise, but the trailers were more interesting than previous. This was entertaining and easy to follow with all the exposition. 

It's a big blockbuster with a loyal fanbase that should love it. Like Infinity War it has an unfulfilling ending that grates where Infinity War didn't - this franchise hasn't earned it. 

If the next movie builds as well on this one, I'd likely give the movies 1-2 stars extra as a pair, because it was entertaining and doesn't take itself seriously at all.",NEUTRAL
"May 29, 2023",It was a great movie but I didnt expect to be left hangin.,POSITIVE

"May 29, 2023",The  director needs to realize ppl are there mainly for the cars and Og cast. Hate to say this but probably my last one. All those actors and the movie stunk. All the money they have and can’t have some solid cars with a dope story line. I genuinely believe I can do better,NEGATIVE

"May 29, 2023","Behind every ""running on fumes"" and ""bumpy road"" pun is a film fan just cynical and morbidly curious enough to see this nutty franchise out, I swear to God. While there are sadly no dinosaurs or sharks to be jumped in this installment, ""Fast X"" thankfully delivers on absurdity in the form of Jason Momoa's turn as possibly the saga's most bombastic retcon to date. This guy's in a totally different movie. Imagine if Castor Troy and Simon Phoenix's lovechild had a ""gang weed""/""society"" phase. Like, the character is so cringeworthy that it sort of horseshoes its way around to being the most entertaining part of the film and, yes, I do mean that as a compliment. You're also given a bevy of those ""of course they brought that character back"" moments, all of which only add on to the franchise's ironically unironic trademark of shameless self-perpetuation. I'd be lying if I didn't say I was continually impressed by the audacity. Look, these aren't great movies anymore. They haven't been great since ""7"" and I know that. I'm simply here so that I can say I was here. I witnessed and contributed to it all. Soon, we'll see on what side of history I end up on, I guess.",NEUTRAL

"May 29, 2023","Una película que para los amantes de la acción les encantara, un villano que pega donde mas le duele al protagonista, secuencias muy buenas que te mantendrán entretenido durante toda la película, espero que para la siguiente película las explicaciones que den para los personajes que regresaron no sea absurda o por lo menos que lo fantasioso no lo lleven a otro nivel, aunque con esta saga ya no se sabe que esperar.",POSITIVE

"May 29, 2023","What a fun time at the movies.  Jason Momoa is the Joker to Vin Diesel's batman.  So much cool action in Rome and Brazil and Portugal, from death ball bombs to using a car to spin exploding helicopters around into things.  The team is scattered through most of the movie and it ends on a cliffhanger, but can't wait for the next one to bring everything together for the last ride.",POSITIVE

"May 29, 2023","Absolutely horrible addition to the Fast & Furious legacy.  The movie was a mess and went all over the place in so many different directions. It also leaves you hanging at the end so you will come back for another one to see what happens.  The acting was good, as always, but the storyline is horrible.  I wish they would of never mentioned Brians name, like he is here and not gone and I wish they would of made a similar movie like the F&F movies up until Paul Walker passed away.   I wanted to walk out after the first 30 minutes, but I was with others. I definitely will not return for another.",NEGATIVE
"May 29, 2023","It was another again awesome action packed, far-fetched adventure. Its too bad though that so many people left at the end of the movie thinking it was over a Credit starting to play and within a few more minutes another scene return to the movie. A lot of people will not know about this unless they hear from others. It leaves it open for another fast and furious tend to come in the future so many things hanging about what will come next great movie great job.  Ride on!",POSITIVE

"May 29, 2023","Too many stories running alongside the main plot story. Antagonist is not believable. The least about cars the Fast and Furious series ever has been. Almost every call back possible (which was a lot). 96% Action, 4% story and random drama. Lastly defying physics a lot.
I left the theatre mentally tired and not gonna watch the follow up movies. Also don't do the ""family"" drinking game. You'll be hospitalized if you do.",NEGATIVE

"May 28, 2023","Audacious - earnestly so - but I had a blast. I'd heard Momoa was great in this, and I agree. This was very much like a grown up version of the cartoons I watched as a kid (long, long ago...). A great bunch of characters who all have a chance to kick butt (and have their butts kicked). I've missed most of the movies in this franchise (I think I saw the first 2, and the Hobbs & Shaw spinoff) but now I'd like to go back and see them all. Despite not having that much familiarity with the ins and outs of this series, it was not hard at all to follow what was going on.",POSITIVE

"May 28, 2023","I was all in, even until the ninth movie with it's space dumbness. In that one, Justin Lin put really much effort in the action scenes, where most of them were practical masterpieces.

But Fast X is the badest and dumbest part in the whole franchise. The action is CD and nothing matters. Never you have a feeling of tension. The action is not a little bit fun to watch. It's just a stupid movie. But this time, not a fun stupid movie. Just stupid. The sunken cost effect forces me to emparrass myself and go to these movies. I am doomed.",NEGATIVE
"May 28, 2023",Actions scenes were good ..dialogue waskinda slow,NEGATIVE
"May 28, 2023",High Tech action was great.  the ending sucked and obviously gave viewers of the next one coming up in 2 or 3 years Uuuuggghhhh!!!!!!!!!,POSITIVE
"May 28, 2023",Horrible movie nothing else needs to be said,NEGATIVE

Enjoyed how they recap the previous movie as well",POSITIVE
"May 28, 2023","I love every scene of the movie. Some part was funny and the rest was very tense with too many stunt. Overall, it was a good  and it seems like there will be a sequel continuation of the movie. The war is not over yet.",POSITIVE
"May 28, 2023",I found it very boring at the beginning but it picked up. Jason Mamoa was awesome. He played his character very well and he almost had a prominent joker vibe to him. The other characters were good too. Another complaint is the plot. Very confusing and I found myself lost a good amount of times. But I would still go see it cause it's a Fast & Furious movie. Always thrilling to see.,NEUTRAL
"May 28, 2023",Non stop action and the inserts of humor were well placed.  The cliff hangers though will leave you grinning.,POSITIVE
"May 28, 2023","Demasiada ficción, nada basado a la realidad como en las primeras entregas, escenas forzadas y sin elocuencia.",NEGATIVE
"May 28, 2023","This installment of the Fast franchise stays true to the spirit of the other films. Vin Diesel does not disappoint. The fight scenes between Michelle and Charlize are brutal... in a good way. Some scenes, like the guy in the punching bag and the toenail painting are just stupid. There are enough explosions and intense moments to give me more than I can for. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride.",POSITIVE
"May 28, 2023","We are talking about the series where the bunch of people crash satelites with cars shoot to space and big dudes smash each other through the walls. Obvioiusly no one should expect a Shakespeare level of writing here or wit of Sherlock Holmes. But if you are after some proper action movie where things flash, explode, crash and explode again, then you will have a hard time to find someting better than F&F series, and Fast X carries the tradition of the series forward with all the usual shenaningans and turns it up to 11. Well worth watching, if you are after this kind of cinema :)",POSITIVE

"May 28, 2023",Action packed from the very beginning,POSITIVE
"May 28, 2023","This was so ridiculous but so much fun. Watching the trailer I wasn't so sure Momoa and the way his character is inserted into Five would work well, but it worked really well. I kind of wish this should've been what followed 7 but on the other hand, without the atrocities that are 8 and 9, this possibly couldn't have ended up as fun and ridiculous. Jason Momoa is here to give the franchise a character that looks like he's having all the fun in the world when every other character is either smouldering cooly or bickering to be funny. They also finally figured out how to use Charlize Theron after wasting her in two movies even in the limited screen time but kinda feels a bit too late but I figure there's more in store in the sequels. Vin Diesel is starting to look old and when Helen Mirren comes onscreen they have this peculiar tension going on like in the previous movies but this time, the age difference doesn't seem jarring anymore, lol. The way they have designed this movie is to make this the Franchise's Infinity War moment, of course not as good, but still, it does work to a point. It's still one of the weaker ones in the franchise, but not as bad as the entries after 7, but without those, I may not have enjoyed this either. I'm pumped to see what the Franchise has to offer going forward. I bet some more resurrections and at least a couple of final deaths are there in store.",NEUTRAL

"May 28, 2023","Best one yet.. so much action- loved Jason Momoa in this one. Love the originals , but added new characters keeps it more interesting. Cannot wait until the next one. But, 2025 is a long time to wait! 5 outta 5 popcorn bags! Brillant!",POSITIVE

"May 28, 2023","Fast X is a great movie it has a lot of great action (enough action that you expected from a fast in the furious movie) and way better than the 9th movie, can't wait for the part 2 sequel and renember don't listen to the critics but listen to the fans",POSITIVE

"May 28, 2023",Action packed and entertaining from beginning to end! This was probably my favorite in the series.,POSITIVE
"May 28, 2023",The character interactions were solid. We all expect to suspend disbelief in exchange for great action shots and easy laughs. Momoa ruins that whole equation. He is gratting and irritating. I actually left the theater annoyed at his character. This is easily the worst fast and furious as there is no campy plot without a good villain. Momoa not only spoiled a summer action flick but ruined my evening leaving me to rant online. This movie is bad enough to make me rethink my opinion of an actor I initially liked a lot in previous rolls.,NEGATIVE

Then the kid jumps cars, unbelievable, but the biggest wopper is the dam scene, ridding down the wall...unbelieavable...almost crap.  These movies were exciting cause they were almost believable, not anymore.  Also, Mamoa didnt do a good job, he seemed to have copied the joker that keith ledger did, not original at all. Even with all of this, it was still nice to see the team and the father son scenes, also dont like Scena, but loved the 90s music.",NEGATIVE

"May 28, 2023","I buckled up for the latest instalment in the adrenaline-fueled franchise, Fast X. Having previously enjoyed the well-made escapist nonsense of this franchise, I eagerly anticipated this action-packed joyride. But the reality falls short of the high-octane thrills and heart-racing moments we've enjoyed during this long-running, beloved series. Directed by a new visionary, Fast X struggles to find its footing, leaving me with a disjointed and lacklustre experience.

Though intended to be the cornerstone of the film, the plot feels convoluted and overstuffed. The narrative attempts to tie up loose ends from previous entries, resulting in a tangled web of unresolved storylines and contrived twists. The themes of loyalty, family, and redemption, which once resonated deeply, are now lost amidst the chaos of overblown action sequences and cheesy dialogue.

Unfortunately, the once-charismatic characters we've grown to love seem to be mere shadows of their former selves. The lacklustre performances by the ensemble cast dampen the film's impact, leaving me yearning for the chemistry and charisma that once made this franchise shine. The newcomers fail to make a lasting impression, and their interactions feel forced, lacking the organic camaraderie we expect from a Fast and Furious film.

While attempting to inject fresh energy into the series, the direction falters in execution. The pacing is erratic, with frenetic action scenes abruptly juxtaposed with moments of forced sentimentality. The director's attempts to reinvent the franchise fall flat, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience.

The score, cinematography, and production design, once standout elements of the Fast and Furious films, fail to leave a lasting impact. The familiar pulsating beats and slick visuals that defined the series are noticeably absent, replaced by generic choices that fail to elevate the overall experience. The special effects, too, lack the finesse and attention to detail we've come to expect, leaving action scenes feeling artificial and detached.

The editing further exacerbates the film's issues with jarring cuts and questionable transitions. Scenes that should have heightened the tension instead fall flat, as the editing fails to maintain a cohesive flow. The dialogue, filled with clichés and uninspired one-liners, adds little depth to the already weak characterisations, leaving me longing for the witty banter and memorable lines that once made these films a guilty pleasure.

While Fast X attempts to recapture the essence of what made this franchise a global phenomenon, it falls short in almost every aspect. As a viewer, I felt a palpable sense of disappointment, longing for the days when these films delivered heart-pounding action and captivating storytelling. It pains me to say that Fast X fails to leave a lasting impact, leaving me questioning the franchise's future.

Fast X is a lacklustre entry in the series, struggling to find its place amidst a convoluted plot, underwhelming performances, and a misguided attempt at reinvention. Despite its best intentions, the film fails to deliver the thrills and emotional resonance that made its predecessors successful. Fast X is a forgettable and disjointed experience that falls far behind the high standards set by the franchise—strap in for a disappointing ride.",NEGATIVE

"May 28, 2023","Fast X's most interesting component is its name. The series simply doesn't have the hook that series such as Marvel, DC, or even Transformers have to continue to keep people wanting to come back and is only able to keep a small amount of fans to keep spending money to see a bland and underwhelming film about people using the steering wheel I'm different ways.",NEGATIVE

"May 27, 2023","I am a huge fan of cars and this series. Highly disappointed. Movie was slow and the wrestlers on the show made it corny. I didn't understand the random scenes for the laugh, it was definitely odd because it's usually a clever sense of humor insert-this time was like watching the Hang Over. Still appreciate the cars and definitely need to bring back the Rock. This was worst than Tokyo Drift. Would recommend this to someone trying to kill time.",NEGATIVE

"May 27, 2023","For me the franchise peaked with Fast 5 but I still enjoyed the 6th & 7th movies.  It's been all downhill from there.  The script for Fast X was very poorly written, the only jokes that landed were by Dante's character.  Jason Momoa was outstanding and gave his all to this movie. Tyrese Gibson on the other hand had some of the worst lines I have ever heard in a movie.  They were so bad that it made me feel uncomfortable and sorry for him. The moment Cipher showed up in the movie and acted like their ally the movie lost me.  She was one of the best (if not the best) villain during the entire franchise. The way they wrote Fast X I have this horrible feeling that she will be at the BBQ at Dom's house at the end of the final movie eating burgers and being part of the gang.",NEGATIVE

"May 27, 2023","This is different from all the other parts of this franchise. This is a must watch and Jason Momoa is beyond expectations, you can compare him with some real villains ever in bollywood. This is a Must Watch. With surprising ending.",POSITIVE
"May 27, 2023","When Jason Momoa's Dante isn't on screen, the movie works, but once Momoa's excessively over-the-top villain takes the center stage, does the movie it's time to hit the brakes. Everything else feels like a ""F&F"" movie when he's not around, but when he and some of the unnecessary humor, Brie Larson's wooden acting and outrageous stunts come in, the movie risks driving into a wall of stupidity at full force.",NEUTRAL

"May 27, 2023","After how bad the previous installment was, I must say that this new sequel revived what the fast and furious franchise is, the action is the best, like its imposing villain, on the other hand, it has the same problems of the other movies and that is the incoherence of its plot, besides that it makes no sense, and although it is not the best in the saga, it is one that you enjoy a lot.",NEUTRAL

"May 27, 2023","Both Jo and I LOVED the 2023 ""Little Mermaid"".  We have a message for all those negative (mainly pro reviewers plus the ones that hate anything nice) the auditorium at the cinema where we watched it lat Friday (26) was FULL. Over 50% of the persons there were children. They were ALL watching it intently for OVER TWO HOURS!! They yelled and clapped it when it had finished. Jo (who is 88) stood and clapped it too.  

If you give a movie like this a ONE or slam it you need another job as a pro reviewer. The rest of you shouldn't bother to go to the cinema at all. I know we all have different ideas on entertainment. If you are entertained by blood, gore, violence, foul language, etc. what on earth were you doing at The Little Mermaid? Hallo - you are NOT going to find it a Walt Disney"" Little Mermaid"". 

Parents, take your children, and if you are like us, elderly you will find it a refreshing change from the Action Super Hero movies that is being sent out ad nausea..  And yes, Jo and I watch them, too.",POSITIVE

"May 27, 2023","The movie is part 1 of either 2 or 3 (not sure if they have decided yet). 
The good… Jason Momoa is the best villain I have seen in any movie in a long time. Quite clearly took inspiration from the joker but unlike most jokers you do feel he would be able to beat Batman in brawn as well as brains.
The bad is the movie tries to be old fast and furious and new fast and furious I.e very cheesy lines ""family"" the nos blue flames are also back in full force.
Some cgi is also very poor, the car chase through Rome in particular as dons car is going down the steps the car really looks to clean like a computer game.

I will be going to see the next installment if only for my need for closure. But if you haven't seen it I would wait for it to be on sky.",NEUTRAL

"May 27, 2023","If Paul Walker is watching from above he'd be ashamed at what this increasingly ludicrous franchise has become. I spent the whole movie just wanting it to end, it was simply insulting, and the whole cinema was bagging it on the way out, young and old alike. Says a lot when even young kids laugh at how bad a modern CGI movie is. As a major F&F fan, it's been hard to watch the gradual demise with increasing levels of fiction ( super magnets anyone? ) but Fast X goes into the stratosphere of bad. I went in with low expectations, and need to revise how low I start out after that travesty.",NEGATIVE
"May 27, 2023","Honestly, this is the worst addition to the series yet. It delivers on high octane thrills as all its predecessors but a little sub par in comparison, it's in the rest of the story that this movie falls flat. Now I know we don't watch fast and furious for the plot but normally there's some semblance of plot and sense, this one however is a complete and utter mess and gives the feeling of being poorly stitched together, the crew is never fully assembled together and working out a plan, in fact most of the movie the majority of the crew is literally doing nothing. Letty is in her own little side story and really doesn't achieve anything that moves the plot along, and same goes for the main crew who pull off a heist gone wrong then wander around trying to get back on their feet to immediately ""apparently"" be blown to bits in a plane… none of the plot makes sense and is actively hard to follow, on top of this there are a lot of questionable choices by the characters that again don't really make sense. It's a shame being back Justin Lin he made the series way better in terms of story, comedy, drama, emotion and even high octane thrills but most importantly there is a feeling of Family that this movie misses.",NEGATIVE

"May 27, 2023","Synopsis: Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), are happy to have renounced their dangerous street racing-heist lifestyle for the peace and safety of their family, until a psychotic revenge seeker, Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) comes knocking.
Review: Roaring fast cars, underworld, cops, and family… The Fast and the Furious franchise for over two decades with minor modifications has pretty much offered us the same content, over the top fast car action, with little to none, emotional heft. Paul Walker's untimely death in 2013, was perhaps the most you felt for the franchise. Over the years, the core team has stayed the same even as newer faces joined the race. Beyond Diesel and his crew, Dwayne Johnson, John Cena, Charlize Theron, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Gal Gadot, Scott Eastwood, Jason Statham and now Jason Momoa, the series has resorted to using actors as minor script updates.
Despite a rather chaotic, silly, and overcrowded plot, Jason Momoa has the most fun with his character. He gives his comical-psychotic villain the insanity and anger of a disgruntled employee on a notice period. He just wants to watch the world burn. His jibes and nicknames for characters (John Cena is uncle muscle) entertains and amuses the most. While he is vindictive and ruthless, he doesn't seem as menacing as his Joker-esque alter ego would imagine.
The plot has little relevance but if you must know, it all begins when Toretto's wisecracking friends are sent on a fake mission to Rome. The team is framed for a massive bomb explosion that turns the agency against them. This moment has the film's most ambitious chase sequence. Drug kingpin Dante is the mastermind, and he is hellbent on making Toretto suffer by depriving him of his family.
You will hear the words ‘family' and ‘agency' after every two lines in the 10th instalment. Are ""the days where a man behind the wheel of a car could make a difference are (truly) over?"" Turns out they aren't over as we have another sequel waiting. Director Louis Leterrier offers an orgy of explosions and car chases demanding minimal emotional investment. If you don't mind a cycle of preposterous action sequences loaded with VFX not allowing a moment of calm, Fast X delivers exactly what it promises. Pete Davidson has a fun cameo. You won't blink even for a second. The film offers mindless popcorn entertainment in every scene in abundance.
However, there is not a single novelty factor and watching one film in the series is as good as watching them all. Not that some other successful franchises haven't taken the same route, but F&F series is nearing its end and you want them to take that VRS. 'How did they let this go on for so long,' indeed?",NEUTRAL

"May 27, 2023","This movie was dumb in the best way. Most of the cast leans into the silliness and there's even some meta commentary on the franchise itself. Vin Diesel is for some reason getting more serious and overly dramatic as we near the finish line, it's a bit painful. But dear god, Jason Mamoa is the best thing to happen to #FastAndFurious. Every time he's on screen, it's pure magic. All in all, I can't wait to see how they finish this.",NEUTRAL

"May 26, 2023","Well ok, Jason Momoa literally made this movie a little better than it should have been! Fast X was a good step up from F9, which I did not enjoy at all. Momoa's villain Dante was definitely the standout here. He's literally The Joker for the Fast franchise. Complete with the eccentric, calculating and at times hilariously twisted personality. He somehow manages to stay one step ahead of Dom and his family that there are times you're not sure how they're going to make it. Oh, and speaking of the family it has grown exponentially! There are so many core characters that there is only one sequence where they're all on screen together. The family dinner at the beginning. They do a decent job of giving characters other than Dom one or two sequences to shine briefly. With that it leads this to being the most globetrotting entry of the franchise because smaller subunits of the family are all in different locations attempting to accomplish a task. However, each task in the grand scheme of the plot while Momoa's villain seems to almost out smart everyone and put characters in situations which seemingly have no way out you never really feel like any of our heroes are ever in any peril. 

Lately this franchise has gotten to the point that a decent chunk of the main core cast/family have become invulnerable to harm and even death. No one really gets hurt or stay's dead for that matter in these movies. This franchise lately refuses or is just scared to kill off anyone from the core Fast family or let characters they've supposedly killed off stay dead. So, while there are scenes where a few characters were seemingly killed in Fast X, until I see the next film and they do not show back up I refuse to believe any of them are truly dead. That heavily undercuts the stakes for this film for me. I even told a friend after we saw F9, that if this character shows back up for the next film, I would be very disappointed and not even care about the franchise anymore. Cut to that very character seemingly coming back into the fold near the end of Fast X. So, there is basically no reason to fear anyone will actually die if you're not a villain. And even some of them do not die! They sometimes end up becoming part of the ""family."" That has been a very frustrating part of these movies for me lately. Overall if you go into this film, just go to see some decent action set pieces. Suspending disbelief is the name of the game with a Fast film and you'll enjoy.

To say all of that seems like I did not enjoy the movie, but I actually did! While Fast X is not the best film in the franchise, like I said it is far better than F9. The story line of how they integrate Momoa's Dante into the story comes with a ""flashback"" to Fast Five where they mix footage from that film with newly shot scenes to show and give some backstory to Dante. We even get to see Paul Walker briefly to keep his legacy within the franchise alive. I was actually a little leery of how this was going to turn out after previous director Justin Lin quit and it was announced that Louis Leterrier was the new director as I've not been a fan of his films and style. However, Fast X seems like a step up even for him and is now one of my favorites of his films. He did very well in directing some good and of course outrageously ridiculous action sequences. Definitely see this on a premium theater screen if you can! The Rome sequence was top tier from the Fast Saga. I was also very surprised how well they've tied all these outside elements into their main storyline and even had a couple of non-leaked surprises in here. There was one twist I did not see coming that actually surprised me! 

Also, the film ends on a huge cliffhanger and has a mid-credits scene that actually has me anticipating the next film for a change. I did not expect that. So do not go into Fast X looking for a conclusion with a nice bow to tie the storyline up in this movie. Even when it's getting close to the end of the movie you feel and can tell there is still too much story for them to wrap up before this movie ends without it being a four plus hour movie. Now I'm not sure if they're going to do two more films as it has recently been hinted at by Vin Diesel, but I personally don't think they need that third one. One more film to wrap everything up seems adequate, which was what they initially planned during the development of Fast X. However, if we are to get two more films and if they can keep at the pace this one set, I think I'll enjoy them as well. My new drinking game will be to see how many ""dead"" characters are resurrected in the final two films. Fast X is not going to gain any new fans, but current fans I feel will be happy and satisfied after a disappointing ninth entry.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2023",The movie is good as long as you don't think much about it and just watch the action. It was pleasant to watch yet we can all agree this franchise is being stretched way too much. Good thing that it will soon end. Better end with a bang while they can than make the movies unwatchable.,POSITIVE

"May 26, 2023","I truly think the Fast and Furious franchise has taken a turn for the worse. Going back to the original movie, the story line was better and it wasn't packed with outrageous CGI and stunts. The older movies were a better balance between the action and story.  Jason Momoa's role and acting reminded me of the Joker from Batman. I wish Universal would go back to the basics and make Fast and Furious like they used to. These newer ones have just been too over the top.  The ending of this movie was also disappointing too.",NEGATIVE

"May 26, 2023","The movie was as expected for The Fast and Furious franchise. The only bright side was Jason Momoa as Dante - he was hilarious and worth watching.

Vin Diesel trying to be a serious actor was cringy. The camera would zoom in on his face and the instrumental version of Charlie Puth's song ""See You Again"" would play. This happened a laughable amount of times. It wasn't touching, it was cheesy.

They said the words 'la familia' so much that if you took a shot for every time they said it, you'd be drunk 30 minutes in.

"May 26, 2023","SPOILERS FOR THIS MOVIE!!!!


Fast X is the best Fast & Furious movie since Fast Five (2011). I'm not joking. This movie is really good and really fun. The characters, action, comedy, all of that works out for this movie. This one is possibly the most action packed Fast & Furious movie yet. There are so many action scenes that I can't even count them. Jason Momoa is a fantastic addition to the Fast Saga, playing as the son of Hernan Reyes, Dante. He might be the best villain out of all of them in the franchise. He acts like a cartoon villain, but at times, you can take him seriously. When he began to say and do some cartoonish things, I instantly fell in love with the character. He has now been one of my favorite characters right next to Hobbs (who makes a cameo appearance in the post credits!) and Jakob. Speaking of Jakob, he has become one of my favorites of Dom's family. Before, he was this serious brother who wanted to kill Dom, but now he's the cool uncle that kills people, but also babysits Little B as he does it. By the end of the movie, he does make a sacrifice, which kills him, and at this point, I don't believe he is dead. In Fast & Furious, they make you believe that this person is dead, but they were actually alive the entire time. Han died in Tokyo Drift, but he came back in F9. Letty died in Fast & Furious (2009), but she came back as an antagonist in Fast & Furious 6. And now, we learn that Gisele, who died in Fast 6, is actually alive. And at this point, it makes me feel like Jakob is alive, because he is! We don't see the body (except for Gisele's), so that doesn't mean that he is dead. It could apply to the past villains as well! You never know!

As much as I like this movie, that doesn't mean it has its negatives. There's a Pete Davidson cameo, and it feels really awkward and really drawn out. Another is that some of the characters either don't do anything to impact the story, or they just aren't in the story at all. Like Mia Toretto for example. She has two scenes in this movie! And this lady is in most of the promotions for this movie! Another is Shaw, who also has two scenes, but he really doesn't do much aside from fighting some bad guys. After he learns that the Agency is going after his mom, he leaves the movie. It's like the writers didn't know what to do with them to make at least a small impact on the story, so they threw them away. Roman in this movie is kind of annoying. He's not too annoying to the point where I'm not having fun, but there are some jokes that just made me roll my eyes a little. Overall, it's a great entry to the Fast Saga and the start of a (hopefully) great trilogy for the end of the Saga.

9/10, one of the best Fast & Furious movies, but not better than Fast Five",POSITIVE

Why can't they find a respectful way to kill off his character.  No one finds it odd that they always save a seat at BBQ for him.  Abuela comes and her grandkids don't come?  Only Mia?  Will Hobbs daughter make an appearance?   How about Shaw's sister and brother?   Little B should be seen hanging/playing with his cousins from Mia and Brian at ""Family"" events. Just saying.

"May 26, 2023","The comparisons I've been seeing to Infinity War, it might sound ridiculous but I get it. As a hardcore Fast and Furious fan who has seen its ups and downs, especially downs in the past feels years. I can confidently say that Fast X has learnt from its past mistakes and that's what I personally think because I know there will be people that don't agree or will just hate on the franchise aimlessly. 

Let's get into the first problem that it fixes and I'll try my best not to spoil anything. One issue I've had with some of the recent F&F that I don't like is that they fail to balance the Family storyline along with the actual storyline which then leads to the film just being an action spectacle and that's all. I honestly think that issue derives from separating the family storyline for the movie's main arc instead of just having the two as one. This film like Furious 7 and Fast Five blends both storyline into one which is why it does so well. They're building off of each other to progress the storyline. It generally felt grounded at moments and I was able to take Dom and these characters seriously, I was able to stay engaged with the story because of this.  The film also ends on an insane cliffhanger and I could be saying this out of pure excitement for what I just watched but it was probably one of the best cliffhangers I've seen. It just played out so well. 

There's partially going to be a plot point spoiler here so you can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know. 
The second problem that Fast X fixes that I had specifically with F9 is there's another betrayal scene. With F9 the betrayal just felt pointless and I didn't care about the characters it was having with, it actually made me hate the film more. In Fast X, it's just done so well and it's one you can't see coming. The film was going to get a lower score because there was an inconsistency that kept making me question why this was a choice but the betrayal scene fixed that instantly. This is also why you don't make judgements until you've fully watched the film. 

The action in this film, over the top, the best in the franchise, just a mind blowing spectacle. They knew this was the start of a finale and they really wanted to make sure people were aware of that and bring out all the stops. One thing I've never said in any of my other F&F reviews is that the camerawork in this was really good, for F&F standards of course. It felt like I was watching something different and they were actually trying instead of doing what they've been doing for 12 years. 

The soundtrack was also really good and reminded me a lot of Fast 8's soundtrack which was just amazing. It's one that I'm 100% going to have to listen to once I get home. We get an instrumental version of See You Again in the film during one scene and it's so impactful in the scene, almost made me cry when I heard it. 

Jason Momoa plays our villain in this film, the son of Reyes from Fast Five. Dante Reyes is one the most menacing sociopathic and energetic villains that this franchise has seen. If I was to have a top 100 villains list, he would honestly make it. The comparisons to Joker are literally uncanny. He's just a straight up lunatic, from that Rome bomb chase scene, you just know what you're getting into with this character. 

Honestly amazing performances from everyone, they all stood out in their scenes, especially Michelle Rodriguez and Charlize Theron, absolutely loved their scenes together and apart. Aside from Jason Momoa, there are 3 new additions to the cast. We have Brie Larson playing Tess, the daughter of Mr. Nobody. She was probably my fav character in the film, Brie played her so well, enjoyed every scene with her, loved her fashion sense and especially her shoes. I do wish we got more screen time with her but there are 2 more films to come. The second newcomer is Daniela Melchior as Isabel. We also got little time with her but for that short amount, you're able to connect with her in the story emotionally and care for her, I won't reveal too much on her now. The final Newcomer is Alan Ritchson as Aimes, the new leader of the Agency. His character has this mysteriousness to him, I think the one thing I wish more from his character was more action scenes as there were only a few. His performance was also really good though and makes me want to check out Reacher. 

Something I normally despise in the F&F films are the retcons they love to do, this film contains another one and I won't spoil in what capacity. This is one retcon that I can get by though because it's one that I've believed to be the case since the event took place in the franchise. So this time around, I'm not mad with it. It all just depends on how they explain it. 

This film has generally made me happy. Fixing issues I've previously had, having a good story, an amazing villain who I'll get into and just one of the best endings I've seen in a while. There are moments I want to talk about that made me scream internally that I just can't because they're spoilers but they were so reminiscent of the original F&F films, Fast and Furious is finally back. If you're not a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise or tapped out then this isn't for you and you won't like it, if you're a fan just like me or enjoy the insanity of these films then this one is for you. Fast X can feel disjointed at times and it does have bad car CGI during certain moments. From a filmmaking standpoint it's also just messy but if you step into the world of Fast and Furious and just feel the vibe of it then it's an amazing film and the best since Furious 7.",POSITIVE

"May 25, 2023","If you're a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, you'll want to skip this one.  It may have ruined the rest of the films for me, retroactively.  You'll get an hour into the movie and wonder if it has even started yet, or what it's about.  As the old adage goes...if everything is a caper, nothing is a caper.  There are no fewer than 28239482 capers on this one, and none of them get off the ground. The reuse some old tricks, and make them seem like it's just work-a-day biz for the F&F crew.  This film also went full Star Wars.  That is...they dumped all the old tricks in surrounded by a bunch of cameos-by-friends.  I mean really...Davidson and Larson?  Stop it.  There were several scenes that were so poorly performed and I thought...""Oh, they'll reshoot that before the final print.""  Yoops.  This was especially true with Larson's scenes.  Dear Hollywood:  She's not good.  And don't even start on Jason Mamoa.  It's like someone said ""Be Joaquin's Joker, but add a little Pee-Wee Herman, and any 4 year old.""  The ""music conducting"" is embarrassing nonsense.  In the end, you get a depressing good-guys-never-win movie that won't end, and has one thousand cliffhangers.

The movie is good , but the timeline of moving seems so tangled, it's a baffling movie for a new audience. Some action scenes feel so monotonous, as an audience i personally feel it doesn't stand at expectations of a fan who is watching this series straight from the 1st part. First half is so gripping, story is moving ahead showing some family love, buts second half is a worst nightmare for a faster and furious fan. Well it will be trilogy even after fast x, so expectations are still on the top fir a last ride🤝.",NEGATIVE

I feel this movie wrung the last bit out of the franchise for me. Great actors can't make up for bad writing.",NEGATIVE
"May 25, 2023","Seriously, not as bad as F9, or Fate. The plot of the story to build a trilogy I really loved, it was very simple but at the same time it was fun with Jason Momoa as Dante Reyes who is a very threatening joker like villain that is perfect for the rest of the trilogy. But of course some negatives too. Flying cars and flying humans but thankfully not as unrealistic as F9. Another negative is that the familia gets even more larger so that there's a lot of characters to juggle. Han is very underused considering he was resurrected in the last one. The familia gets sperated during the movie but at the end the cliffhanger seals the deal and I will watch the eleventh installment whenever it's coming out.",POSITIVE

"May 25, 2023","Everybody loves a sure thing and there is nothing more guaranteed than a Fast and Furious movie that is full of action and adventure and that most defining quality, family. In what could be the first half of the final film, this was a great half.

It's been time since the events of the previous movie, but it is the events of the fifth film that come back to haunt Dominic Toretto and his family and friends. The son of the Brazilian mobster the family stole $100 million from has spent the past decade plotting revenge. Turning their previous foe into an afterthought as they realize this man is a stone-cold psychopath out to make them suffer before their eventual demise. Many familiar faces return alongside new faces with action from the United States, Italy, Brazil, England, and Portugal - with all the action and drama that makes these movies great.

This was a great start into what I can only imagine will be an epic finale, it's a shame the wait has to be so long. Vin Diesel is as great as ever as well as the rest of the family with Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Nathalie Emmanuelle, Sung Kang, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Charlize Theron, Helen Mirren, and Jason Statham back in action. But it's the new faces in Brie Larson, Daniela Melchior, Alan Hutchison, and the unbelievably ferocious Jason Momoa delivering the performance of a lifetime. This was a fun time in the cinema and it will be a long agonizing wait for the next film.",POSITIVE
"May 25, 2023","Worst movie I've ever seen. I know they preach ""FAMILY"" but sometimes a family needs to die. Momoa is over the top, Vin Diesel doesn't realize that is an action romp with his stoic expression that never changes, the rest of the cast are just cashing their paychecks at this point. The scenes are so wildly unrealistic that you can't even enjoy them.  I wish I could say more but I need to wash my eyes out of this filth.",NEGATIVE

"May 25, 2023","Let me be clear, this movie was absolutely terrible. Probably the corniest film I seen in the past 3 years (cause I haven’t watched the last 2 or 3 Fast & Furious movies) but it was so damn corny and over the top that I constantly found myself looking over to my girl saying “BRUH” followed by exploding laughter. Probably top 5 comedies of the year if I’m being honest. I came in with very low expectations and they disappointed those so much, it was laughable. Which is what saved it lmao highly recommend watching this movie under the influence to enjoy it as much as we did. #FAMILY 🤣🤣",NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2023","Jason Momoas character ruined the entire thing. I understand certain parts of the movie are unrealistic and that can be frustrating, HOWEVER the biggest part of the movie is family, and the storyline has always been how important family is, and every villain the story has dealt with before momoa played their role perfect and took it serious, especially the part of putting does family in danger to get what they wanted, and they never played it as a joke. Putting momoa as a villain and then having him be who he was? Making jokes about it? His personality in the movie? Everything was ick. I'm sorry but literally they ruined the ENTIRE legacy with this one movie. I was so disappointed.",NEGATIVE

I liked how they worked Paul Walker in at the beginning as tribute and then worked what happened when they stole the vault in the other Fast and Furious and mixed it in with the new part with Jason Momoa.  He was really great with all his nail polish.  Somebody must have had the same dream I had, the dead man's face.

"May 25, 2023","This has got to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever watched. I went to the bathroom twice and didn't even care about what I may have missed. Jason Momoa as the bad guy makes the whole movie worth it and that's about it. He was actually brilliant. Nice to see him do something different. This flick is two and a half hours of ridiculous nonsense. Now all the other Fast movies are pretty implausible but not ridiculous like this one. They were good and enjoyable. But this one? Ridiculous, farcical, totally impossible stunts. And how the heck do they get their cars in all of these far out places? Even with all the money, it's not possible in the timeframe given.  Which just adds to the nonsense. Fast X has a great family/loyalty theme, which I appreciate. And some of the fight scenes are amazing (Theron and Rodriguez!). And I love all the actors. But all in all, it sucks. Especially, when at the end you find out it's actually not the last one. I'm all in for a good cliffhanger but sheesh, people. This really took it too far.",NEGATIVE

Second, this film is clearly setting up an even bigger story -- hence the abrupt ending. Third, this film was wildly entertaining in the usual FF style, but a little too long. There were moments that could have been trimmed down to maintain momentum. The Family was front and center, and the action sequences were as absurd as ever, but at least there were no spacecars. Definitely recommend if you are a fan of the FF franchise. Jason Momoa was AWESOME -- may be his best role yet.",NEUTRAL

"May 24, 2023","The movie was one incredibly unlikely, ridiculous stunt-filled scene after another.  When it does get talky, the awful acting shows.  Jason Mamoa's character (characterization) is so annoying that I cringed every time he was on screen.  I've seen every movie in the series and it seems the goal is to out-landish the previous films.  Then, to top it off, it ends in the middle of the action.  I'm a fan of all the bad actors in the movie but enough is enough.  Very disappointing.",NEUTRAL

"May 24, 2023","This franchise never disappoints. I love that theyre leaning into being absolutely ridiculous. I wont lie, I do miss the racing roots that this franchise comes from. But I am enjoying the ride theyve created. And the fact they have characters that become meta and see how outlandish its become. Theyre essentially super heroes with extraordinary abilities and driving skills so god like they ignore all laws of reality. Which is why I go to the movies. Its a spectacle and while its not for everyone, it will find its audience. I came for the cars and I stayed for family.",POSITIVE

"May 24, 2023","The only reason I put two stars is for the acting of Jason Momoa. At least he acted the rest were either in a commercial or a video game. This movie is total corn and totally revolves around Vin Diesel, who couldn’t act his way out of a paper bag. John Cena gave it a good try. The little boy that played Vin Diesel’s alleged son was really awful. He must be someone’s friend or relative. The movie itself was nothing but fighting and total CGI and strayed way far away from car racing. Jordana Brewster, who weighs all of 100 pounds is in there with 3 to 5 swat soldiers in full dress with giant machine guns kicking their butts ha ha. Michelle Rodriguez should’ve stuck with machete. The entire movie was a cross between a comic book and a video game. ",NEGATIVE

"May 24, 2023","The franchise is successful. It didn't need the addition of more big names for these two movies. I do think by the time the next one (second part of this) comes around I'll have forgotten everything but also I probably won't care. This movie switched me off, despite some really very good action scenes, it was not as good as the past couple have been. Unfortunately the ""twists"" were formulaic and easily foreseen (and one I didn't even care about), and the baddie seems much too hammy a performance. It's also too much to push on us so many enemies working together and the rising from the dead/ acting like people are dead (yawn, please let people just die already). These two are meant to be the end - and we would expect thrills and chases- but all they're going to do, unless the next one delivers, is damage their own good brand. It is entertaining for an afternoon or slow night but not one I'd watch more than twice (presumably I'll have to watch it again to remember the details so I can see the next!). But let's face it, they'll bank a lot of cash for the franchise and movie investors everywhere will stick with the ensemble known cast, too many stories going on and ott loved up teams, and we will all just keep buying the tickets 😗because - after all - we love Vin Diesel, fast cars, pretty people and Doms ""family"".",NEGATIVE

"May 24, 2023","Asinine movie! What used to be a good franchise has turned into stupidity. Turetto’s son was born white in previous movie but was black for this movie. Brie Larson’s acting looked forced—-simply reading script lines, no acting ability. Momoa, painting his nails while sporting two girlish ponytail bobs and trying to mimic Joaquin’s Joker persona was…well a dumb copy cat version. The car action scenes used to be great but now they have gotten so ridiculously far fetched. The scene where Turreto’s small son jumps from one racing car to the other was pretty stupid. The whole movie is full of unbelievably stupid action scenes and riddled with poor acting abilities. And a surprise appearance from a character that died in a previous movie in this franchise?!? Throwing in big name actors to only give them 10-minutes of showtime?! Waste of money and time but I learned my lesson—-will not be watching any future sequels to this ridiculously dumb franchise!",NEGATIVE

"May 24, 2023",I loved the fact that the movie never disappoints with ACTION and AI TECHNOLOGY and the stunts are INSANE. They took us back to the beginning and that was amazing to see. My personal CON is Jason Mamoa ewwwwww he assumed the role of the Joker out of a Batman Movie and it was not cute to watch!!!! I also did not like the ending the cliffhangers didn't make me excited like all the others but I am looking forward to the next sequel with THE ROCK and I hope his daughter makes an appearance!

"May 24, 2023","Long, convoluted, too many characters to keep straight. Thought it was a Batman movie. Not a ""real"" movie at all--because there was no ending! And upon further investigation, Part 2 is still in development! Maybe a 3-hour edited version of parts 1 and 2 combined will ultimately be more satisfying. Photography sharp, compositionally well-planned. Color excellent and vibrant. Musical score intensifies the action and is well-used. One character's acting obviously delightfully over the top. The others all little too earnest, overly sentimental, and often too dewy-eyed and melancholy for its own good. Fun cameos throughout. 1950's ""Around the World in 80 Days"" type film for the car chase/espionage/criminally unhinged grudge scene.",NEUTRAL
"May 24, 2023",It's a cartoon that prints money at this point.  The story and writing are trash.,NEGATIVE
"May 24, 2023","Alot of fighting, alot of car chases and crashes, fairly typical ""Fast"" movie.  They destroyed parts of Rome!  Guess they tried to include a lot of people from previous movies but to me their inclusions did nothing to the  story line, only made the movie longer...and I like Jason Statham and Helen Mirren (noting a few of these inclusers).  Best part of the movie were the rolls played by John Cena and Jason Momoa.  But what was the purpose of the guy unzipping from a bag (?) and high-tailing it out of there in his tighty-whities?  Several crashes were unrealistic especially the one on the bridge toward the end of the movie where there appeared absolutely no form of law enforcement showed up to control the situation.  Vin Diesel's close-up expressions throughout the movie made him look like he may have been a little confused about what was happening.  
All in all, it was a long movie and I was so looking forward to this being as good as the previous ones but, unfortunately I don't think it hit the mark....at least for me...sorry.",NEUTRAL

"May 24, 2023","I wanted this to be the best Fast movie ever. I recently went back and binged through everything. They all hold up. I love this series, hook it to my veins. 

It just wasn't though. I felt like there's a little too much liberal CGI usage. I love the campy action and that stuff was here but there was just a few too many times where the cgi was really obvious imo. 

I hate to say it too but I thought the kid sucked. Either I didn't like his acting or the scripting was really bad. He seemed pretty wooden and I thought so many of the scenes with him and Vin especially felt like there was no dialogue, it was all just one liners being spoken. 

Now, with that being said. Momoa might be the best ancillary character in any of these movies. His performance is totally unhinged. I'd love to have heard what direction he was given cuz if they said ""play the joker, only louder"" I wouldn't be surprised. He's androgynous, he's insane, he's calculating, he's deceptive, he's deranged, he's bombastic, he's outlandish…it's just an awesome performance and it only grows on you as the movie goes along. At first I was like ""strange clothes"" or ""why is he sort of dancing"". But then it gets bigger, and he keeps adding to it. And it's absolutely like a Heath Ledger joker type performance in my eyes. I hope I'm not overselling it, but I wanna rewatch this just for More Momoa.",NEUTRAL

"May 24, 2023","Loved this movie. Easily the best Fast movie since Fast 7. Part 8 and 9 were probably the two worst movies of the series, but part 10 is a fresh return to the fun Fast franchise.

Can't wait to see what the final two movies hold for us fans, after the 2 cameos in this one.",POSITIVE

He said he lost interest in the first 30 minutes, especially after the crane scene, but he was making remarks about the tires still being in tact just prior to that.

"May 24, 2023","I genuinely have no business reviewing Fast X. I'm not a big fan of the Fast and Furious movies, and really only saw this one because I was curious to see how truly ridiculous this one would be after F9 took some of its characters to space IN A CAR. Needless to say, I don't think very highly of these movies to begin with. 

On the positive side… it's a little better than the last few movies, and a little less crazy and ridiculous. However on a more negative note… it's an absolutely horrendous garbage movie; it's a complete mess of a film. But… I don't regret watching it because I had a completely good time while the movie was on screen. I was dying of laughter for most of the film alongside my friends — the movie was hilarious…ly bad. Alas, we were all laughing AT the movie, not with it. It would have been fine if this movie was intended as a comedy… but the fact it asks us to take it seriously when it's essentially an unintentional self-parody of the franchise makes it quite problematic. It's a fast-food movie, and quite forgettable, but I can't say I wasn't entertained while watching it.

But you can be entertained while recognizing the movie you are watching is absolutely a piece of crap at the same time. The only reason I gave it this high a rating is because of how good a time it let me have with my friends. I can guarantee if I was to have watched this alone… I would rate it much lower.
I know I am part of the problem here, but I really hate that audiences today are so accepting of movies that really don't try. This movie is so ridiculous and stupid that it is entertaining, but it has absolutely no story, no characters, and nothing to care about to back up the mindless action we see on screen. Why do we assume you can only have one or the other? Why do we just accept being given one or the other? We can have a good movie with strong writing while also having great, bombastic action! For example, Mission: Impossible - Fallout, or even Captain America: Civil War gave us riveting narratives, wonderful twists and turns that made sense, multi-dimensional, layered characters with beautiful inter-character conflicts and they did all of that while also giving us big bombastic set-pieces, great action, and great fights. So I don't know why when it comes to this franchise we as film audiences just accept being handed half-assed mediocrity. I expect better. Heck, in the last year we've seen better: John Wick 4, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Top Gun: Maverick, or even Avatar: The Way of Water. I would love to enjoy Fast X as the filmmakers intended me to, but I can't when all they offer is mindless, ridiculous action with no semblance of depth, story, or character. They gave me absolutely no reason to care. If they want me to enjoy it as a comedy, fine — then I'd say this was an effective movie. But the fact that they ask us as the audience to take it all seriously… it makes me truly want to laugh at the movie. Because they didn't do the work to earn my emotion, my attention in that regard. Sure, there were redeeming qualities and I had a good time laughing at it with my friends, but that doesn't let them off the hook for making a terrible movie.

I mean, when half your movie is shot without a director, and when you eventually hire one, you only give him 3 days to prepare before shooting… I don't know what else you expect to get besides a mess. This film was probably doomed from the start, and even if Louis Leterrier did try his best to save the film, there is absolutely no way he could have saved it with the circumstances he was put in. Considering those circumstances… maybe this is a decent film. But it shows why movies need a director at the helm — it is very clear that many sequences here were shot without clear direction and vision. They are all over the place, with many different tones and visual languages. It really feels like an instance where there were too many cooks in the kitchen, and that is likely because Leterrier was brought on too late. The film is just all over the place and I can't say it ever felt cohesive. Plus, as part 1 of a larger story, it falls into all the traps that a part 1 could: it's all set up, no resolution, it has really dumb twists leading to an unbelievable cliffhanger that I couldn't take seriously, and most of the plotlines in the movie just felt like filler. It also really tried to copy the Infinity War template, splitting up the crew into groups on different ""missions"" (I say it in quotations because really only Dom had a plot where he had to do things, the rest of the characters were just running). The story as a whole is nonsensical and is riddled with plot holes and misleading moments that don't make sense when the twists are revealed. It also has some pretty horrible dialogue… like Star Wars prequel levels of awkwardness. Even the humour didn't land. At least the action was exciting again, even if it was still quite silly and ridiculous. (The crane scene in Rome had me howling… you'll know it when you see it).

BUT… Jason Momoa was goddamn fantastic in this movie! He was the highlight for me, and would be one of the only reasons I'd ever rewatch this one! Momoa knows what kind of movie he's in from the start (seems to be the only cast member who knows), and he just has fun with the role! I loved how he played it, not taking it overly seriously and delivering one of the best and most memorable villains in the franchise because of this. I loved his energy and how bonkers of a performance he gave — despite giving a very silly performance, he commanded the screen with it! If only more of the cast could have fun with it like Momoa did!

I'm finishing writing this review a day after I saw Fast X… and I gotta say… I can barely remember what happened. It's a very forgettable movie that left no lasting impression on me. For a movie that cost $340 million to make (where'd that money go??), you'd think it would have offered up something so incredible, so memorable. Instead… it's just 2 and a half hours of mediocrity that is really only fun if you're with a group of friends. Sure, it might be the best since Furious 7, but that's not a very high bar to beat. The movie is pretty bad.

Maybe Part 2 can be better… but at this rate, I don't have high hopes.

And yet, I know I'll be there with a group of friends laughing at the ridiculousness on screen, just like with this one.

It's really the only way to get through these movies.",NEUTRAL

"May 24, 2023","The previous fast and furious movies were plot based.  The villains had some maturity.  The plot in this movie was not well developed.  Throwing big name stars at a movie does not make that movie a 5-star attraction.  Too many times the movie went back and forth with too many behind the scenes stories.  This made the movie boring at times and at others was just out and out bad fantasy that led to the final scene wondering why Hollywood is trying to remake movies using old versions of the original movie.

"May 24, 2023","Okay so this is actually a great movie. Obviously suspend your beliefs and leave that stuff at the door but I thought this movie helped save the franchise. It brought the plot and characters back down to earth (from space, literally…) and refreshed its characters, somehow making them more likeable than they were before. The chemistry between Charlize Theron and Michelle Rodriguez was fantastic, making Cipher's character so much more fun to watch. 

They made the effort to give Jason Momoa's villain a back story and are actually investing screen time in making him a proper villain. He isn't just bad to be bad - he's got a purpose and reason, and is genuinely maniacal. His character was Joker meets Jason Statham. The scene with the margaritas and painting the henchmen's toes was T W I S T E D and I couldn't believe they actually went there. 

While I don't think this end-of-franchise plot can stretch to THREE parts (Oof lol) I am definitely looking forward to seeing where they go with the plot and how they end off these characters.",POSITIVE

"May 24, 2023","Pure adrenaline rush!!! Fast Five is my favorite movie of the series (tied with the 1st) so I loved that the main antagonist was derived from that film. Jason Mamoa as Dante was hilarious, chaotic and maniacal! A ton of funny moments and heartfelt ones. I cant wait until part 2 comes out to see this crazy end to this great franchise!",POSITIVE

"May 23, 2023",It was great to see past characters involved. I didnt like Momoas character. A lot of over the top car stunts. Glad to see the Rock back. Lets see what Fast 11 brings.,POSITIVE
"May 23, 2023","hated the ending, cliff hangers are great for TV but not for movies when you have to wait 2 years to see what happens. lord of the rings was one of a few exceptions. and even they wrapped up every installment so you left the theater with anticipation rather than frustration.  plus that franchise was one movie broken into multiple parts in theaters only one year after the last. Disappointed with who ever made this decision. will not refer this movie, just wait for the next installment to update you on the previous one.",NEGATIVE
"May 23, 2023",Very good good movie,POSITIVE
"May 23, 2023","Jason Momoa was is the show, to go a long with strong performances by Vin Diesel and John Cena.
So basically, the whole Fast X film acts as a first act for the next two films to follow up. I totally get it. This first was a great warm up for what's to come for the next couple of Fast and Furious movies. Cliffhangers galore at the end of Fast X. No one truly stays down in the Fast and Furious franchise. Which in some cases ruin logic, when we find out who tried to 'off' who. And they might be working together all this time, all along. Which, when you look at the film those events occurred in, there's no way they survived. So maybe the world of the Fast & Furious movies is the after life of that universe or the characters are being resurrected by some supernatural car, or all the fatalities were faked to look real in order to go into hiding at a predetermined location. Why? We'll find out next film. I don't watch Fast & Furious movies for logic and reason, even though I love to deduce and theorize certain plot points of film and TV shows. I give 'Fast X' 4 out 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5 and .25 more to this review for total of 4.25/5.
Hopefully we get more of John Cena's characters. Like I said, nobody stays down in Fast & Furious",POSITIVE
"May 23, 2023",Very movie but cheesy as always,POSITIVE
"May 23, 2023","It's like the producers put a bunch of little kids in a room with a lot of toy cars; observing them play with said toys, & using those ideas for their action scenes. Over the top unrealistic, cringe level, cheap movie/lousy story line vibes.",NEGATIVE
"May 23, 2023",Was a pretty good movie but the sound could be a little lower,POSITIVE

"May 23, 2023","It’s about what you would expect from a fast and the furious movie ridiculous action, cheesy dialogue, car mayhem and a plot that doesn’t take itself all that seriously which is a part of the charm for me personally. You turn your brain off and you just enjoy a crazy action movie that will most definitely break the laws of physics, but it isn’t fast and the furious these days without that. I like that they tried to re-create a street race, but it really didn’t have the same charm as it once did. Overall, it’s a decent 6.5/10.",NEUTRAL

"May 23, 2023","If you want a half decent action film, go and see it. If you're going for any other reason, in my personal opinion, it wasn't that good. The special effects left a lot to be desired, the plot was predictable at best. ((((((SPOILER ALERT, SCROLL DOWN TO READ)))))), but yeah, enjoyable action film, otherwise, quite a let down.




The ending was VERY dissatisfying, confusing and anticlimactic. But I'm sure in true F&F fashion, they'll find a way of wiggling out of the corner they have wrote themselves into, yet again...",NEGATIVE

"May 23, 2023",I loved Fast X! Such a fun movie. Jason Momoa absolutely crushes it as the villain. I cannot wait to see what they do next.,POSITIVE
"May 23, 2023","Well, what can I say?! It's, like always, absolutely ridiculous, and I came to the conclusion that Toretto definitely flies a lot more inside some car during his flicks than Superman does in any of his movies. Thus said I naturally laughed my butt off in many of the scenes. But even though, Edition 10 is not as idiotic as 8 or 9. There are some good fighting and action sequences and all together it is quite some fun, mainly on the absurd and ridiculous side, where one naturally has to completely switch off one's brain and discard any laws of physics, but still fun. And as always there is too much of that moronic ""Family above all"" ChitChat which, not only by now, but already 6 or 7 editions ago, became very lame and annoying. Anyway I give the whole crazily over the top show 7 out of 10 points as it is quite entertaining. Unfortunately Momoa was a complete miscast for the vengeful maniac (and I normally like the guy).",NEUTRAL
"May 23, 2023","The Aqua Man who laughs. The fun part of these movies is watching Vin Diesel attempt to be a serious actor while everything else is ridiculous around him. At times, the movie thinks it's not what it is, but Aqua Man is priceless",NEUTRAL

"May 23, 2023",I was saddened by the ending I was hoping it was going to a Happy Ending with a happily ever after romance get my memory back type of way but I still loved it and hope that the New Team that was created will bring on new adventures for the new Guardians,POSITIVE

"May 23, 2023","A lot of fun if you're already invested in the series. If you're not, a lot of this will come off as nonsense spectacle. I enjoyed the ride, but hope the place where it cuts off is a bit annoying. I hope the next one ends with a lot more closure.",NEUTRAL

"May 23, 2023","Based on just mindless fun action, then yeah you could argue its ""good."" But if you want substance and some semblance of stakes, then no, this movie make you indifferent to everything possible. Random subplots that clearly are added to force more films (literally confirmed that this is the case) that could've easily been taken out and finished in this one movie. The pacing was just so unbearable, [SPOILER WARNING.....] they went from a bomb possibly blowing up the Vatican to a street race in Brazil? HUH? At least in the other movies they gradually built up to the ultimate set piece and ended, here, they'll drag you along to another film that you'll pay 12 bucks for in the future.",NEGATIVE

"May 23, 2023","I enjoy the message, which is “Fomily” and the soundtrack has gotten better over the years. This particular installment of the franchise wasn’t so over the top as in years past. A must see, especially in ScreenX, Dolby Cinema, IMAX or 4DX. 🌄",POSITIVE

"May 23, 2023","1st of all, Jason Momoa's character is the saving grace of this film. Momoa pulls off a great performance as a villain and his character is very well written. The Fast series is one of my favorite franchises of all time and with that being said I enjoyed seeing a new film on the screen, however… this was a non-stop action film that began to get a little boring and downright cheesy at times. A lot of the action scenes were a little ""too much"" over the top and almost annoying at times. I mean, how many times can you blow up, smash, shoot up, and drop Dom's car and it still keeps ticking without fault? Also, some of the comedy that is typically classic and hilarious in prior films between Tez and Roman really fell flat in this film. At the end of the way it was worth a watch and I am excited for future films, I just hope they do better than they did for this installment of the franchise.",NEUTRAL

"May 23, 2023","o filme erra e acerta em alguns pontos.
Pontos Negativos: Ludmilla no filme foi uma participação tosca, alguns momentos o humor nao funciona e deixa a cena meio chata.

Pontos positivos: o humor, assim como nao funciona em certas ocasiões, em outras funciona muito bem! mas o maior acerto de todo o filme, é sem dúvidas o VILÃO! Jason Momoa mandou bem demais nesse papel, personagem dele tá estilo Coringa das idéias, a morte do Jacob também é bastante pesada e dolorosa.

esse filme acerta e erra promete porradaria, ação e entrega bem, mas tem alguns momentos peca e erra.

"May 23, 2023","Vin & the team have gone from committing theft and robbery of truck drivers to theft and robbery of their fans.  We have officially gone from a movie series about cars and car culture to the most ""nonsensical Hollywood"" production possible.

To Justin Lin and the team, please bring back the cars, the tuning culture, and the sense of community.  We don't need show downs between all our ""favorite"" characters - just give us good driving scenes, bring us along for the tuning of cool new vehicles, and let us feel like a part of the underground street racing community - not 30 second clips of girls in provocative clothing dancing, only to see 3-5 second clips of a car.

Everyone loved the original Supra because we ""saw"" the transformation"", felt with the characters, and knew the feeling of building a car to go fast.  There was a story line - a mystery to be solved.

Now, every scene is a new ""hot spot location"" around the world with the same ""Dodge Charger"" or Hellcat Challenger - jumping off bridges, swinging off helicopters, and landing out of airplanes.

This movie lacks any sort of logical story line, has overly cheesy scripting, and only had one cool car - an early 240Z with a widebody with the mentioned of an RB.  With (1) actual race scene in the entire movie, I am left wanting and disappointed - do better.

Save your money and just re-watch the dying of a franchise in Fast Six thru Nine and be doubly entertained.  As a true car enthusiast, Paul Walker would be disappointed - I am disappointed.

I hope Justin Lin and team reads this because the feedback needs to be heard.",NEGATIVE

"May 23, 2023",Leterrier disappoints with a movie that tries much too hard to appeal to his predecessors. The action was similar to other Fast movies but plot and characters was bar none the worst in the series thus far. Diesel's character remains as stale as every and another forgetful villain makes this movie barely worth watching a trailer for.,NEGATIVE

"May 23, 2023","I really enjoyed the movie and how they always include Brian and things from the past to tie the present together. I did not like the Cliff hanger at the end, but that means another movie is coming, so excited about that. :-)",POSITIVE
"May 23, 2023","SPOILER ALERT!
For once, they had a very good story with lots of potential, but if you keep bringing people back from the dead and make normal people more powerful than the avengers...you're killing the story.
If you really want the audience to hate the bad guy, let the person who they killed, stay dead lol.

Also, Dom's son is a full on black child. How is that possible? The kid is only 1/4 black since Dom is half black and his mother is Brazilian. 

Jason Mamoa did a great job! Happy to see Jason Statham again too. But, Brie Larson has no business in this franchise. Her role was pointless, sorry. Why not make a new badass character instead of pushing female actresses in roles where nepotism is underlined in the story? I also think it's still weird that Han is alive and even weirder that Giselle is too. These characters are unbreakable. The new Justice League of America.",NEUTRAL

"May 23, 2023","For a film that was over 2 hours long there was zero story to it, and was literally Dom talking about family,  Letty shouting Dom like she does in every F&F film. Roman being the usual loudmouth who brings nothing to the plot, same could be said of all the ""Family"". A grandmother that hasn't ever been mentioned in any of the previous 9 films, suddenly appears and disappears.
All the previous characters just turning up for 30 seconds of screen time was ridiculous to say the least, they brought nothing to the film and didn't really move the ""plot"" along, not that there was a plot. 
It really was stupid ending it on a cliff hanger and then expecting people to have to wait 2 years until Fast XI is released.
Overall it's a film franchise that should of be killed off many years ago.",NEGATIVE

"May 23, 2023",While as usual there are quite a few eye rolling moments in this movie. But that's par for the course in the Fast series. And as usual the dialog seems to have been written by a twelve year old. But Jason Mamoa's performance as Dante the antagonist to Dom saves this movie. If not for Mamoa's performance this film would have been a cringy comedy due to its silly dialog and ridiculous stunts. But Dante is one of the best antagonists in the Fast series. Mamoa's performance is far and away better than anyone else in this film. He carries the whole movie. So if you're a fan of the series you should definitely give it a shot. If you can't get past the unbelievable stunts and the cheesy dialog you should probably just wait for streaming.,NEUTRAL

"May 23, 2023","An improvement over F9, Fast X might be quite silly and over-the-top as usual but it does a good job setting up the beginning of the end with Jason Momoa having the time of his life playing against type as the Big Bad whose hammy yet still a legitimate threat, higher stakes, memorable action sequences and plot twists that are easier to swallow than the soap opera nonsense of the last film as well as a mid-credits surprise given the fallout of some behind-the-scenes drama over clashing egos. There are some truly dumb moments like Han getting high on a drugged muffin that, as far as I know at the time of writing this, hasn't actually affected the plot but overall this is yet another good old-fashioned bit of fun where the characters are just as in on the joke as the audience are. I mean, how can you not be amused by some of John Cena's airport-to-airplane shenanigans with his nephew in tow? And that's without getting into how even people who don't follow wrestling are likely to point out that a muscular dude like him would stick out like a sore thumb. I hope Fast X breaks even at the box office since I'm worried that audiences might be alienated by the cliffhanger ending since, if you didn't follow the Internet news, this movie, like Dune 2021, gives no indication that it's part of a Movie Multipack outside of the ""The End of the Road Begins"" tagline. And we really don't need another Divergent Series: Allegiant situation on our hands. Hopefully the next two parts will live up to the hype. Just go easy on the trailers next time. Fast X's trailers were a tad too long and ruined the surprise when it came to action sequences. Just a bit of advice for Vin Diesel, Universal and whomever edited the trailers.",POSITIVE
"May 23, 2023",It was a lot of action right away so the plot didn’t have much to build up to. But I love the movie and all the actors and actresses! Can’t wait for the next one!!,POSITIVE
"May 23, 2023",Liked the action sequences even if the overall story line was weak.,POSITIVE
"May 23, 2023","Fast x 

❌Spoilers❌This is an improvement for f9 and John Cena's character. In so many ways. He feels more like peacemaker, which makes him so much more fun, because in F9 he had no personality and he barely even had screen time and I love John Cena so it's great to see him doing his shtick here also, that nail painting sequence was hilarious I don't know what it is but Jason Momoa just elevates it with his fun but truly menacing villain. I love seeing Daniela Melchior in another film, because I absolutely love her as ratcatcher two in the suicide squad, and this film has a lot of suicide squad actors like Pete, Davidson, John Cena, and Daniela Melchior so that's actually pretty cool because I absolutely love the suicide squad and it's one of my favorite DC films but now, getting into the nitty-gritty of it all damn, that is one Hell of a cliffhanger this is like the infinity war fast and furious saga. I cannot wait for fast and furious 11. This movie is exciting. I'm pretty sure not everybody's dead like I'm sure Jacob is sadly because he just started to get good but I'm fine with it because the family is too big at this point so they kind of need to get rid of some as much as I hate to say it but fast X is exciting three part conclusion that I can't wait to see if this is just the start. I think they're on a roll. I probably need to watch this again getting into more of my negatives. I'm sad that Bree Larson didn't have a bigger role it's like nobody knows what to do with her in Hollywood but I'm glad she's in here I know people don't like that Shaw is a good guy now and that he just kinda became their family I will say that's a little weird but cipher how can you redeem cipher she was going to kill a baby I don't know that's a little bit of a stretch. Also, I would've liked them to have a little bit more time with Shaw and Han but they don't. I also feel like the series doesn't really know what to do with Han either but I'm sure they'll find something he's not dead, right right I don't know this was a very exciting entry can't wait to see what they do next 7/10",NEUTRAL

"May 23, 2023","My hopes where high, I went Thursday, opening night to see the movie. Hoping for movie that was toned down and closer to the original movie in franchise that started it all, compared to the later iterations. Unfortunately not so, they simply doubled down on all the craziness from Fast V and up, literally reusing material from movies 5-9 but some how tieing it together in a worse package. (Spoiler… Kind of….) There seems to be absolutely no linearity it's almost like 5 different plots happening at once that are tied together by nothing more than ""Family"". Characters show up merely to make a cameo adding little to nothing to the plot and than disappearing never to be seen again. I hope you know the movie ends on a cliff hanger because I didn't and that was not a good moment. They tried to match Marvels Infinity War strategy but while marvel left you a feeling of sorrow, worry, and defeat that made you feel one with the characters and match there will to continue, Fast X will leave you exhausted, confused and frankly wanting the an ending simply to no longer perpetuate this dying franchise. I will wait for fast X(2fast) fast Xl or whatever they call it to be streamable watch it at home and finally end this series that has strung me along only because of the nostalgia of watching it growing up when I was 5 and see cars actually progress, get fast, and race and not whatever this is now.

I feel like the last two they lost sense of what these movies are all about. Bringing every character back from the dead taking away the emotion from the story, the fast themed music that went through out the series, turning street racers into super heros. Dude you guys are destroying the franchise. Atleast 5-7 involved awesome cars while doing heists and more realistic type race scenes.

"May 22, 2023","Fast X is an unabashed next step in this series' mission to depict escalating vehicular mania. It's certainly enjoyable and even thrilling at points, but it does lack some novelty. As Fast X speeds the Fast and Furious franchise into its final lap, it can't help but feel like we're going in circles.

Fast X follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) as they raise their son away from their enemies and the battles that have taken up much of their time for decades. Dominic's friends and soldiers of the wheel-Roman (Tyrese Gibso), Tej (Ludacris), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) -all go on a mission to Rome, Italy, for an underground government organization. However, the mission isn't real and both the agency and Dom's pals are duped by an old foe that emerges from the shadows to exact revenge on Dom and his family. This villain, Dante (Jason Momoa), threatens to break Dom's family into pieces, so the family must figure out how to save themselves from Dante and new government agents who have Dom in their crosshairs.

These Fast and Furious characters used to steal TVs off of moving trucks-now they save the Vatican. These movies succeed most when they know what they are and what you want. It's a rollercoaster, so at a certain point you just throw your hands up and enjoy the ride. Dominic Toretto is basically inhuman by now; nothing can kill him and he can bend the laws of reality and science to his will. Action is the primary draw of these films-story has become secondary as the saga of Dom and his band of street racers turned superheroes cruises into its 11th entry. Fast X, however, goes all in on plot, which feels like a miscalculation. Especially as the second half refuses to reach any kind of conclusion, barreling towards a silly cliffhanger that does little to maintain the stakes the first half establishes. None of the racers we've come to know and love are safe, but the way Fast X wraps up, it's hard not to feel like all of them are.

Jason Momoa is unbelievable in this movie as Dante. He's easily the best villain Dom and the crew have ever fought against. This level of gleeful, over-the-top evil is hard to find in any movie, but it's a gift in the heightened world of Fast and Furious. He gets all the movie's best laughs-you almost wish he would crush Dominic's world so we could watch him laugh, twirl, and dance as it all goes up in flames. John Cena's a lot of fun, too. He takes a page from Momoa's playbook, an action hero who loses the self-seriousness and has a good time playing uncle to Dom's young son. Tyrese Gibson is ever a delight as Roman. Gibson always has a lot fun with this role, and he understands exactly what energy he must bring to keep the franchise full of life. Practically every time he comes on screen, the audience erupts into laughter.

I give Fast X 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, for some language, frequent intense action and some graphic violence. Fast X zooms into theaters on May 19, 2023. Vroom vroom. By Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST!",NEUTRAL
"May 22, 2023",It's a dumb fun soap opera worthy of an ongoing comic book series. This isn't a jumping in point but should the tenth movie of a franchise (eleventh if you count Hobbs and Shaw) be a jumping in point?

"May 22, 2023","It badly wanted to be like ""John Wick"", but just didn't quite get there for me. There are too many loose ends that weren't tied, a few implausible, confusing, and cheesey plot lines (bad guys become good, but it's a trick, as they were actually bad all along); too many new -- yet undeveloped --characters, only suiting parts of plotlines; forced dialogue in places; and, lacking any resolution, it feels like total bait to get us to see the next sequel. I'm all for theoretically left-open endings (thinking is good for humanity, as opposed to being spoon fed every conclusion to completeness), but in this case, they didn't even try. The villain also had no redeeming qualities and felt too absurd to believe, even lazy. A few redeeming qualities would humanize him and give us more conflicting emotions and nuance, much like dealing with people and even family members (whom we can't choose or avoid) in real life. Yet at times, it felt too slow and trying too hard to make us feel for the little boy and the vulnerable, albeit mostly random new characters, just to have any semblance of a purpose aside from the visuals. Also, Dom's car taking hit after hit and still left intact had me roll my eyes. Is it action or fantasy?

The good qualities about this movie include a star studded cast (2 main stars poached from GoT, along with butt-kicking Michelle Rodriguez and co. from the returning cast), stunning visuals and tech, adrenaline boosting action, and predictably, fast and cool rides and machines. With that in mind, it's a decent action flick to see, if action is the main purpose.",NEUTRAL

"May 22, 2023","I thought the movie was so unrealistic the stunts the action, they can supposedly take out dozens of people with guns and come out alive after each fight so unrealistic movie was pure cringe I liked Jason momoa in the movie I thought his character was funny and ironically kinda likeable the rest of the characters were cringe I thought the acting looked very cringe and forced no charisma except for Jason's character witch was the only likeable one the rest were so boring and they tried to be funny but literally no one was laughing in the cinema honestly the movie felt like it was never going to end worst film I've seen in a long time do not recommend also how is dominic torettos son Black with Afro hair his mother and father are white makes no sense think they're trying to bow to the woke mob also I feel like they're ruining the legacy of fast and furious it's not even about cars anymore it's all spy Cra* and undercover this undercover that secret locations etc 0 Stars don't waste your cash on this movie because I guarantee you'll want a refund.",NEGATIVE
"May 22, 2023","Eu particularmente sou fã da trilogia original, pés no chão, o mundo das corridas de rua, perseguição da polícia, enredo voltado para essa parte, depois do 5 filme virou algo que não ruim mas na minha opinião perde a essência do que deveria ser o filme, o fato de personagens morrerem e voltarem é um ponto ruim. O Jason Malmoa rouba a cena no filme, as cenas de ação são mto boas, mas eu senti que personagens como o Han está la por conveniência não agrega nada. É uma boa experiência vou sempre curtir essa saga porque marcou minha infância.",NEUTRAL

"May 22, 2023","This movie had potential. I would give a spoiler alert but you can't spoil what's already rotten. It began with a thrilling and enchanting concept then ended with absurdly predictable and unrealistic nature inversion making it into just another in a long line of redundant and cliche' stories, with an emasculating narrative. Our characters of interest include, as usual: an exaggeratedly incompetent male protagonist, who repeatedly demonstrates himself as a bumbling failure, playing sidekick to an equally exaggeratedly superhuman heroine, who repeatedly saves the day, after her baffoon of a sidekick botches up every single situation they encounter.
Sloppy writing, at best, betraying an obvious Napoleon complex, on the part of the author.
By the... ..third?.. ...forth? (I lost count) time she saves him from himself, which was up to the last 10 minutes of the film (if you want to call it that): I was completely over it. Go watch tomb raider, with Angelina Jolie, instead. It's a more honest and slightly more balanced representation of the same story.

Other than be a fantasy movie with no realism their is great news!!! The movie leaves you on a cliff hanger yay.

"May 22, 2023",Absolutely dreadful and waste of time. It is so sad that big budget films are produced simply to get fans back in seats for the same movie. This movie is awful.

"May 22, 2023","The film does a good job of highlighting the strengths of the previous entries. From the opening scene, this movie goes back to what made ""Fast Five"" and ""Furious 7"" so strong (two of my favorite films in the series). The characters have a depth that connects them, even the newly introduced villain.

One of the best elements of the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise is the villains, with stars like Jason Statham (""The Italian Job""), Charlize Theron (""Mad Max: Fury Road"") and John Cena (""The Suicide Squad"") playing the last three antagonists. This film is no different, as Jason Momoa steps up to the plate. Though his character has an acquired taste, I was a fan by the end of this story. 

As this film is the 10th entry in the ""Fast and Furious"" world, there are some recycled moments. Some of these scenes help elevate the story, but others feel a bit lazy. Similarly, the franchise has a difficult time saying goodbye to characters. Trying to stay spoiler-free, my opinion is that once a character has an emotional send off, they need to stay gone. 

The dramatic moments are a tad melodramatic, and the humor never truly lands (other than the Jason Momoa scenes). The action sequences are long, which is typical in the world of Dominic Toretto. Unfortunately, there are an abundance of subplots that become convoluted and distracting from the core story. 

""Fast X"" is exactly what you would expect from the 10th entry in a movie about cars, guns and heists. The explosions are big, every situation is over-the-top and it seems to have more characters than ""Infinity War"". The film isn't perfect, but the franchise continues strong with 11th and 12th films already greenlit. 
Note: Take note of how many times the word ""family"" is used throughout the film. 

Best Character: Dante
Best Scene: ""See you again"" in the garage.
Best Song: ""My City""",NEUTRAL

"May 22, 2023","Well to be honest Fast saga and marvel movies were my gateway to the Hollywood and than to the world cinema if it weren't for this to movies franchises I would have never discover great movies from different parts of the world. 
And this both franchise means to me a lot I know they have some flaws in it but they hold a special place in my heart especially the Fast saga. 
This fast and furious movies help me to cope with the difficult time I was facing back than. 
Also the adrenaline rush I get after watching this movie is on next level when I was watching Fast X in theaters I was so edge of my seat even though I know that this all are overthetop action scenes but still I get goosebumps at time. 
For me Fast five is peak movie in this franchise and I think if they do the 11&12 movie right they can top this but fast five is one the most engaging action film in the franchise. 
Fast Ten your seat belts cause things are gonna be crazy in this movie.
Action of this film was great and I was at edge of rhe seat many times. 
Emotions in this film is about right amount. 
Vfx could have been better especially in the 3rd act . 
Pacing is good but the film doesn't end they just stop playing it. 
Storytelling wise it is better than the previous two and more grounded I like how they connected with the previous films. 
Screenplay is perfectly done at start it lags but they catches up. 
For Future expectations I don't have much but the way this movie ends I am so excited to the next ones if they manage to get RDJ in the future films than I would be thriller. 
Overall I liked this movie it was funny, goofy at time and packed with action. I know it is not class world cinema but a person who hates this mass action entertainer films probably hates fun too. 
Jason Mamoa killed it.",POSITIVE
"May 22, 2023",Even Atomic Blonde and Jack Reacher could not save this sermonizing farce of a comedy. Cena probably asked to be killed off so he would not asked to do another one. Saving grace: special effects.,NEGATIVE

"May 22, 2023",Fast X is everything movie theaters where created for & more. It isn't reinventing the wheel or trying to get awards. It's just good old fashioned entertainment mixed with some of the most fun & authenticity enjoyable acting I've seen on a screen in years. These people writing bad reviews want so badly to be edgy/ redefine what a good movie is that they miss whole point of why the fast franchise exists & the ultimate unwanted truth that these critics refuse to see… that Fast is the only real movie going experience left in a post Oscar Hollywood that is even coming close to the golden era of cinema. So Cheers 🥂& let's hope that soon the middle class will raise again & that these suits fighting over there statues of self praise will stop telling us what to like / watch & just let Us & tbh the fucking actors enjoy ourselves,POSITIVE

"May 22, 2023","This one really misses the mark by a long shot. Theres no essence of what makes these films great in this one. First of all, Jason Mamoa's character is one of the worst characters ever portrayed on film, I couldn't stand watching him and I feel embarrassed for him. The plot seems like a fine enough plot for a film like this, for the most part its…. Okay? But the 4 or so sub plots happening simultaneously are not only wildly boring, they're completely unnecessary. I don't know who wrote the dialogue but it felt so amateur, and when no one is giving exposition the scenes are drowned with constant fist fights or shoot outs, its so repetitive and ridiculous. The driving sequences have become boring and most if not all are spoiled in the trailers. The CGI is video game quality. The interactions between characters feel like actors delivering lines, especially from Vin Diesel. I don't know why they refuse to have Brian in these films because at this point its just insane that he is not present, it doesn't even make sense anymore now that Mia is back in these films. Why is she the only one attending the BBQs and not the 3 of them (husband, wife and son) as a family? Especially when they teased him at the end of Fast 9. It feels really awkward at this point. I'm sure his brother at the very least would feel honoured to step into the character. Nothing really good to say about this film to be honest.",NEGATIVE
"May 22, 2023","Wouldn't see it again, The Action was ok but The Ending was worst ending to a movie I have seen in a long time obviously there's going to be a sequel just on what happened at the end.",NEGATIVE
"May 22, 2023","They are all too old for this, and they definitely look it. Multiple location sites. Numerous actors with a chaotic all over the place storyline that is a bit much to piece together. The movie just didn't hold up as well as previous movies in the franchise, there was just too much going on.
Pete Davidson? Jesus Christ. Rome and Tej tussling? It's clear the writers didn't have anything worthy.
Jason Momoa's first scene came off as extremely stiff and uncomfortable. It would've been nice to actually see him in the Fast Five movie instead of them making up this new storyline and character YEARS later. His behavior and mannerisms were a bit confusing. He gave off flimsy, flamboyant, gypsy, genie joker vibes .. Is the character gay or just extremely sassy?
The scraggly wet mop on Letty's head is too matronly and homely, looks horrible for her.

A ball of steel rorating in Rome while crashing cars is the main idea of the movie

Dude kissing a cross is 40% of the abstract

"May 22, 2023","With the budget going into overstimulating effects and the facility's to balance one liner humor with self serious stakes, this one definitely gets an X in the franchise.",NEGATIVE
"May 22, 2023","Low expectations going in, felt as though the previous installment crossed the line between entertainment and absurdity, which in the past they've just about managed to tread, and was expecting more of the same from this. They dialled it in slightly but it's still mind-numbingly silly for the majority of it's bloated run-time, but if you're after non-stop (oftentimes questionable CGI) action sequences for two and a half hours then you'll get what you pay for. Made me forget that this was meant to be a two-part film, the cliffhanger at the end was almost laughable trying to ""set the stakes"" for part two, the franchise over the last three films has proved that there's no actual danger to any of the main characters, they can just inexpicably bring them back - even if we see them die - and explain how they miraculously survived through a lazily-written exposition piece (can't wait to see what they come up with to make sense of the final scene of this one). 

The bright point of this film, which I was dreading going in based off what I'd seen from the trailers, was Jason Momoa as the eccentric, flamboyant, supervillain-esque antagonist. He clearly had a lot of fun in the role and brings a refreshing change to Charlize Theron's bland, emotionless hacker, who thankfully takes a backseat role (but is still around so we're not done with her yet unfortunately). He'll be the main reason people tune in for the next one.

Like with most ""cinematic universes"" that we're endlessly subjected to these days, there's been an apathetic feeling towards this franchise for a long time, but they're easy to watch nostalgia trips so we'll pay to keep seeing them, even though the quality is likely to decline each time. We're already down the rabbit hole, so we might as well begrudgingly see it out to it's end (if Vin Diesel makes up his mind on when that is).",NEGATIVE

"May 22, 2023",Better than F9. It seems that I have to make this longer but the first sentence is my review of this movie. Thank you very much.,POSITIVE
"May 22, 2023","Very simple and flaky story... The duologue literally tells you information you just discovered or understand by watching. The bond between the actors and character setup is just really a long stretch. Verry little comedic relief, everyone just seems robotic with a single facial expression. Oh and in this movie your in for a treat because Van Diesel has two facial expressions in this one, Kinda and understand father/family face and classic serious face. It ended on another cliffhanger for another to comout again... It's age shows... By a lot.",NEGATIVE
"May 22, 2023",The script was patchy...and a unnatural mix of avenger cast with fast and furious franchise with 2 mins dedicated to each character for no apparent reason. This was probably the worst of all fast n furious.,NEGATIVE

"May 22, 2023",Action after action. No time for any other thing. Typical Fast - what people want. Dont think just enjoy,POSITIVE

"May 22, 2023","Storyline wasn't logic, slot of things didn't add up. Jason was great and dark, he really enjoyed this (looking at his acting and face). Beginning with old movie scenes is very unnecessary. This way we can all make a movie. It doesn't need that for a sequel. Dom was to emotional and is from too soft back in the end to the rough guy again. Doesn't need these soft scenes. We didn't understand the story, and we watched all the movies. Missing the link over and over from the first movie.",NEUTRAL

"May 22, 2023","Too much of everything.  It wants to be a satire of action movies and itself for part of the time, then it keeps hammering the sincere values of 'family is everything' the rest of the time.  It's a live cartoon that's not cartoon enough..",NEGATIVE

"May 22, 2023",I didn’t like the ending of the movie. It was a waste of my time . It is awful that there won’t be another Fast XI made for the future . ,NEGATIVE
"May 22, 2023","This movie didn't jump the shark. It strapped an f16 rocket to an '88 civic and drove it straight in to the Bermuda triangle, and that is a more logical situation than anything that happened in this movie. 

I must say before moving on, that I have been a ""Fast"" apologist since 2Fast2Furious.

The movie is comically ridiculous, and painful to watch at times. Where I have been trained to suspend my disbelief being a WWE fan my entire life. There were moments in the film that I couldn't curtail my laughter at the idea that no matter what, Torretto just may in fact be more powerful than Thanos himself.

Imagine Torretto was a character in GTA V, and you used the indestructible cheat code while in the middle of a 5 star police chase. 

Even that was more believable.

The real hero of this film was Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa. His acting is reminiscent of a hybrid, Heath Ledger's Joker, and Deadpool. Funny, intense, quarky, and psychotic. One of the funnest antagonists I have ever watched.

This movie is bad, there's no justifying it, but the badness is what made it funny for me. 

If you have an open mind, and a sense of humor, give it a watch. 

Fast X was entertaining for all of the wrong reasons.",NEUTRAL

"May 22, 2023","May I start by saying no one should go to a Fast & Furious movie thinking it will hint at Shakespeare. These are not movies with intricate plots and mystery. They are just for fun and excitement. With that in mind, Fast X satisfied!  Physics and gravity be damned!  Let's just have some fun thrill ride is what you get here. Sit back and enjoy!",POSITIVE

"May 22, 2023",I'm disappointed with the way this movie was done. It's gone off the rails from the original Fast and Furious. I was at the movie theater and had prepaid or I would have walked out. This doesn't make sense on so many levels. Jason Momoa's role was uncalled for. I just don't understand the point.,NEGATIVE

"May 22, 2023","Worst one out of all of them. Ive been a loyal fan since day one!  I was turned off within the first 20 minutes of watching. The movie had no point to it. The movie would have been better without that fruit cake Dante. You can count me out on watching, if another movie comes out!",NEGATIVE
"May 22, 2023","Wassup, y’all! The year was 2001. My homie Mike and I were roommates living in College Park, GA. Four years removed from our hometown yet four years deep in ATL shenanigans. I had a Honda Del-Sol and wasn’t afraid to race anything on the highway. There was this new movie out called “The Fast and the Furious” playing at the Magic Johnson Theater so I went to check it out. Once the movie let out, I got in my mighty Del Sol – full of adrenaline – and drove around 100 mph weaving in and out of traffic all the way back home! That film had me hooked. Apparently, I wasn’t the only one because twenty-two years and 6.6 billion accumulated dollars later, the franchise still has folks flying through traffic to watch it. In the latest installment, a new villain, perhaps the most sinister of them all, has Dominic Toretto and the Furious gang on his hitlist, and he ain’t giving two shyts about traffic laws. Let’s go!

     Go Speed Racer, go Speed Racer, go Speed Racer gooooooo! “Fast X” stars pretty much the entire Fast and Furious crew from the last film, with a few new additions. The frenetic family is at home chillin’ without a care but unbeknownst to them, a psychopath has been plotting the ultimate revenge scheme that will leave Toretto’s soul in shambles. If you’ve been rocking with this franchise, you know it has changed – and that’s an understatement. Going from plausible plots to straight-up outrageous storylines transformed this series dramatically, but its metamorphosis has been a gradual process so we should be accustomed to the over-the-top antics by now. The newest offering is nothing short of unbelievable, but I’m here to tell ya – it’s an action-packed smash up derby! I’ll start with the antagonist. Jason Momoa is the apex of bad guys! Dante Reyes, Momoa’s character, loves only one thing: infliction of suffering. He’s an eccentric, flamboyant Castor Troy from the movie “Face Off” mixed with a little sadism of The Joker from the Batman comics. Momoa gives a fantastic performance and definitely injects new life into the movie. The rest of the cast does a good job as well. No one is really given any riveting character arcs or anything groundbreaking, although Tyrese’s character Roman has a meatier purpose this time around. I mean, it’s still Roman, so don’t expect any dramatic dialogue. 

     Action is the hallmark of the “Fast” franchise, right? Well, action’s foot is never taken off the accelerator! Just when you thought there were no more outlandish action scenes to be conceived, director Louis Leterrier says, shiiiiiiiid! Explosion!!! Overpowering, over the competition they’re towering! Bomb balls rolling down the streets of The Vatican, people jumping out of cars at Mach 5 speeds, bullets flying but no one dying, it’s illogical but amazing. The feats we see onscreen are impossible to mere mortals, but this is the family of Dom Toretto, dammit, they CAN’T die! Deep down, we don’t want them to, either. All jokes aside, the action is must-see movie magic. In all the mayhem, there is a pretty good plot, too. Even in all its glory, the flaws stand out like a Lamborghini in the hood. Bad tone shifts are louder than a muffler, some “in-house” fight scenes are forced and unnecessary, and near the end of the 2nd act, it begins to veer off track. Having said that, “Fast X” is still one heart-racing, 95 octane thrill ride. If you’re a fan of the franchise, you’ll love this! I’m gonna co-sign “Fast X” to the fullest. There are hella surprises in this film, and please stick around for the mid-credit scene. As I always say, if you can, check it out in IMAX! Yeah, eventually, this thing is gonna end, but while it’s redlining down theater highway, just enjoy the ride…",POSITIVE

"May 22, 2023","The preposterous stunts and improbably twists were entertaining, although past the point of believability. What turned me off was the intentional linking of the villain to being gay and mentally ill. They didn't need to be homophobic, but decided to go for it with the villain painting toenails (albeit on corpses) and prancing about. In a story dripping with crosses and the emphasis on family, it's sad that they felt the need to turn to hate.",NEGATIVE

"May 22, 2023",As far as I was concerned after watching this movie it was pretty cheesy as far as Jason moma character was portrayed. The franchise has gotten really far away from the racing aspect of the movie.. Now it's all about missions and working for the government. What in the beginning they fought against?. There are some really cool scenes in the movie. But that is about it it was not a complete movie. They left you hanging for the next one at the number 11 to come outhere was a surprise in the and that was kind of cool and I'm. Looking forward to seeing the next one hopefully they just have a better overall movie. In my opinion this movie just was not that good.,NEGATIVE

"May 22, 2023","Fast X is a cinematic experience that will surely leave you questioning the limits of logic and embracing the absurdity of the fast and furious franchise. If you're looking for a movie that takes itself seriously and offers a thought-provoking narrative, then this is definitely not the film for you.

The plot of Fast X revolves around a group of street racers turned superheroes who find themselves battling evil masterminds, all while driving at ridiculously high speeds and performing mind-boggling stunts. It's a predictable story that doesn't offer much in terms of depth or originality.

The characters in the movie are one-dimensional at best, with most of their dialogue consisting of cheesy one-liners and poorly executed attempts at humor. The film seems to prioritize juvenile antics and immature humor over character development or compelling storytelling.

Visually, Fast X is a spectacle, with high-octane action sequences and elaborate car chases that defy the laws of physics. However, the constant bombardment of over-the-top explosions and mindless destruction becomes repetitive and loses its impact as the movie progresses.

One of the most frustrating aspects of Fast X is its blatant disregard for any semblance of realism. The laws of physics are repeatedly bent, if not outright broken, to accommodate the filmmakers' desire for increasingly outrageous stunts. While it may be entertaining for some, it undermines any sense of believability and leaves you questioning the filmmakers' dedication to coherence.

In the end, Fast X is a mindless and ridiculous movie that aims to entertain through sheer spectacle and outrageousness. It's a film that thrives on juvenile humor and embraces its own immaturity. If you're in the mood for mindless action and don't mind sacrificing logic and coherence, then this film might offer some temporary amusement. However, if you're seeking a movie with substance and depth, it's best to look elsewhere",NEGATIVE
"May 22, 2023","The greatest movie you’ll wish you never watched!  Fast X has all the drama, action and all star cast…unfortunately, the movie ends in a cliffhanger as if moviegoers will be able to tune in next week to catch Part II.",POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","The characters are still who we have grown to love. Jason Momoa was incredible. The story line, I enjoyed - but the unbelievable stunts, it’s way too over the top and honestly really detracted from the film. The ending felt very abrupt, but was happy with the end credit scene. This film needs to go back to its roots, a little less crazy would go a long way toward bringing it back full circle. Love these characters and hate to see them navigating these completely unrealistic scenarios. Writers…Let’s bring it back down to earth before you ruin it completely.",NEUTRAL
"May 21, 2023",The ending was confusing,NEUTRAL
"May 21, 2023","Awesome action packed movie.  A little long, but nevertheless, great. Wasn't crazy about Momoa's weird flakey character, would've preferred a less fruity villain.",POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","NOT my genre of film, not expecting much, yet the special effects, stunts and high budget action was a WOW and enjoyable good vs bad plot without a cuss word every sentence.   Enjoyable and surprising looks like Vin has finally taken acting lessons, worth seeing.",NEUTRAL

"May 21, 2023",Jason mamoa is the best bad guy thus far.  Very creative.,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",I love the F& F franchise. My only issue is how really over the top each new movie gets and yet everyone survives without any injuries except a few scratches. Watching a child jump from one speeding car into another is just ridiculous without any harm. Why have it in the movie,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023",The movie is a completely disaster the participation of Jason Momoa was a crap it was more like a joker the history is terrible no street race at all they should stopped in fast 7 after Paul walker die seriously is a terrible movie and ending in nothing just with showing Giselle back to life friend of cyber is a completely crap,NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023","Ive disliked the last two movies because I feel like theyd gotten away from what originally was FF, racing, but I actually enjoyed this one. No cars in outer space thankfully! Lol a twist for sure towards the end",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",Action packed.  WOW!!,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","Way way way over the top and unrealistic. The movie is expected unrealistic situational outcomes, expected street racing but, the movie ends open-ended leaving room for a follow up movie.   Why won't this franchise die already?",NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023",So umm where do I start with FastX it's such a great movie that is so much better than the past movies in the franchise. The acting is phenomenal especially Vin Diesel and Jason Mamoas characters. It is very entertaining and enjoyable. If you are thinking it's going to be bad just know you are wrong and you should definitely see it for yourself. I wasn't expecting much but damn I was wrong and I'm happy I was. The suspense is great especially at the last 10 minutes of the film. I really do feel it proved us wrong and that the franchise will have a great ending. It literally exceeded my expectations. While I can say there was too much special effects but it did end up working at the end.,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","Absolutely LOVED it!! Jason Momoa was such a great villain, so many cameos, great action scenes and it really started to tie all the previous movies together. Stay after the credits. You won't be disappointed. Such a great movie!!",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","Brian didn’t make a new appearance in the movie, but overall it was great!",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","Awesome movie, didn't disappoint in any way. Ending was a surprise.",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","Ok, the lines were absolutely cringe-worthy, Aquaman bad guy was the epitome of the 1 dimensional cartoon villain. The action was so nonsensical that if Dom’s Dodge transformed into an Autobot, I wouldn’t be surprised in the slightest. Brie Larson might be thEEE worst working actress in Hollywood. Michelle Rodriguez looks like she’s been working in the adult film industry for 20 years and it finally caught up with her (great shape though, big kudos). That being said, it was hugely entertaining and fun, can’t wait to see the follow up. Go have some fun at the theater, it’s a good ole’ time.",NEUTRAL
"May 21, 2023",Kept you on your feet the whole movie . Action packed from start to finish . Would recommend it to anyone that loves cars to watch it .,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","This movie was action packed.  Loved how it all
Came together.  How all the characters were neatly connected.  So if you havent seen any of the other movies you can still understand this one.  My suggestion see them anyway.  
I thought that Mamoa wasnt going to be a good bad guy but he did an excellent job and the biggest surprise was the Rock at the end.",POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","A lot an action with no end it sight, why because there's going to be a part maybe 3 before this franchise is over. If I'd known that my opinion on this movie would be different, I truly thought this was going to be a 3 hour 🎦",NEUTRAL
"May 21, 2023","Amazing action movie, full of thrills, for people who love the fast series. Jason Mamoa was great!",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","Fast X
The FAST Saga continues 

Decided to join the family at the Sunday cookout and things got really crazy 

On a scale of 1-10 of ridiculousness ,  this movie ranks as an 11 . Almost feels like people in these movies have inherited the toon force. With the things that happen in these movies everyone should be dead within 5 minutes. Action/Destruction are all on max settings. I now know where those low budget Bollywood/Tollywood movies get all their ridiculous vfx ideas from. It's directly from Vin Diesel. 

Acting wise the core characters were no different from previous movies including Dom. He still stands out as the leader and guy who can warp reality to suit his needs. I bet him and John Wick from the last movie would make one unstoppable force.
The support characters where decent, hatd have a good balance since there is just so many of them but they did enough to make you still want to know what happens to them.

The villain Jason was great and felt like a proper threat but there where a ton of moments where he was just annoying AF especially with the way he acted and what outfits he wore. Coming back to the toon force reference it also applies to him as some moments just make you scratch your head and say WTF. 

The movie does end on a cliffhanger and teases part 2 of 300 . Unlike the other movies there was no Sunday cookout here so leaves you wondering what's next, almost feels like how a TV series would end.",NEUTRAL
"May 21, 2023",Wow! Lots of action!,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",Almost slept during the show. At least they didnt drive in the space this time chose to drive on a dam instead lol. This franchise needs to die.,NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023","The action was mostly centered on Vin Diesel, and was not what I expected. The story has no end as it's part one of an obvious two part. I also thought the CGI was not up to speed for this brand of movie.",NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023",Loved the movie can wait for the next one.  Love the Fast family they never disappoint,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","Look, it's not going to win any new fans…but for those who love the franchise, it's spot on and connects to the overall story pretty well.  I just hope the next one is truly the end and they don't drag it out further.",POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","Fabulous action scenes and an over the top (in the best way) Jason Mamoa performance, could not help this from being just another entry to a dying franchise. Characters feel more like caricatures of themselves. Most lines feel like they are delivered in the 80’s Stallone/Schwarzenegger style. Then to be cheated out of an ending was disappointing.",NEUTRAL

"May 21, 2023",I really liked this movie and I’m looking forward to the last part.  One thing I that would have made the movie better for me is if there had been more if the Shaw character in it.  I’m a fan of Jason Statham.,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","Before I go on ranting about how awful the story/film was I want to dicuss about the best part, which was the performance of Jason Momoa.

This part is a spoiler, so be warned.

I was expecting a big, strong, kickass character from Jason Momoa, but I got quite the opposite. He was a camp, ballet-dancing, insane psychopath; which is weird, but he made it look awesome.

Now onto how disappointing the movie was.

It felt like they got scenes from Fast 7, 8 and 9 and put them together, there was nothing new, just the same old; we're family, over-the-top CGI and action scenes.

There is one thing; I will have to watch it again when it comes out on FREE streaming because I did fall asleep repetitively and missed quite a lot. Almost every time I opened my eyes I just saw the same long, boring scenes.

Next time I'll watch it with a large jug of coffee to keep me awake.",NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023","Hated the ending, could've sat through another hour to get more action!

Cons:
1. You can predict the script super easy. like 15 minutes ahead.
2. It creates stories about characters that have no previous history. 
3. Not enough Jason Statham in the movie. 
4. SCREW FAST X-2 just end the series NOW.
5. Too much pointless conversation that don't help the development of the movie.

Pros
1. Jason Momoa plays the PERFECT villain. This is his calling as a actor.
2. John Cena actually was fun character in the movie with such small roll-made a big impact.
3. Rock isn't in the movie lol!
4. Alot of @ss hahaha.

Thats pretty much it. I would recommend waiting for its release on Redbox.",NEGATIVE

"May 21, 2023",Fast X is way better than Fast 9. There is a few scenes where you think no way they can live through that . But if you turn your mind off and just enjoy the movie.

"May 21, 2023","Too long, boring plot and a wide open ending, frustrating!",NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023","""Fast X"" comes as a pleasant, fun surprise in a series that has seen some good highs and mediocre lows. The film teeters the perfect line of being just over-the-top to not be too incomprehensible but not too safe of an action film either. Stakes are raised considerably, culminating in a well-done cliffhanger, effectively hanging audiences on the edge of their seats for more. The Fast Saga may not be totally done for after all as the team behind these hyper street racing films have proved that even the most exhaustive franchises can still have hope. And all it takes…is family.",POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","There are movies where you just need to turn your brain off and enjoy it, Fast X is sadly not that case, F9 already felt like they had an empty tank, this movie felt like pushing a car by feet, Jason Momoa was definitely the highlight here.",NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023",Love the movie 🎬  The actors were great can't wait to see what happens next really great movie,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","Fell asleep in the cinemas, I wasn't the only one. I got woken up by my partner after a nap. Two people on our aisle crashed hard, they didn't wake up, even for the end. I thought the action scenes were cool, but the plot was poor. Too many unbelievable or impossible scenes. Very predictable plot. The franchise has drifted far from the first 5. 
Focused on too much action scenes rather than a plot or character building. Introduced way too many actors. giving 2 stars only for the action scenes.
Jason mamoa was actually decent.",NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023",Was a great movie but honestly after seeing all the previews with most of the best scenes could have been a bit better.,NEUTRAL
"May 21, 2023","I have always liked how this series has revolved around family and the importance of family. This latest installment is not exception. The action scenes were great! The ending left a lot of unanswered questions that can only be answered with another installment. Overall, it was a good movie.",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",Fast 10 was action packed I liked it,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","What happened to this franchise??  No longer about a car subculture. Now they seem to think they’ve all become some sort of world saving super heroes with unrealistic events and HORRIBLE scripting. All of it comes across forced and cheesy. I’ve tried to stick in there as a huge fan, but I quit!  Walked out of this one. I’m done!",NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023",I loved the entire movie from beginning to end. Can't wait for part 2!!!!,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","La película es mala, pero malísima. Teniendo un presupuesto tan alto que no logran hacer efectos especiales decentes, pare que estoy viendo el juego de Asphalt de Gameloft. Ahora, me molesta que me anden reviviendo a personajes que ya murieron. Nunca sientes ese peligro que corren los personajes, porque sabes que no morirán!. iré a ver la XI porque pues ya solo quiero ver en que jalada terminan.",NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023","Utter trash. Same concept of resurrection of dead characters, introducing new ones, and killing the present ones. Villains from previous movies become good guys. What is worse is the inconclusive climax with the movie ending abruptly, because the cast is so long, that by the time gal gadot gets a chance to speak, credits start. It just keeps getting worse after every sequel. After tokyo drift they lost the plot.",NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023","Loved the new Jason Momoa movie. I mean the new Fast & Furious.. 
Jason Momoa gave serious Joker vibes!",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",it was Fabulous! I always looked forward to Fast and Furious Movies! The Actors are Great! Sure enjoyed the movie!,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","""Fast X"" continues the trend of the last few movies by being so self-aware that it comes off as kind of dumb. I think there is some fun to be had for franchise fans here, but the silliness of this current era of movies is getting a bit out of hand. I actually have no issue that the movies are implausible or ridiculous and still have a blast with the action scenes. I think the issue with the movies nowadays is that the storylines are kind of stale and they try too hard to involve every single character that has ever existed in the series. I think the best part of this movie is Jason Momoa and he's really the only part I liked more than the 9th one. I still feel that this movie and the last one are the worst in the franchise. All that being said, the movie is dumb, but at the same time, it's fun. I saw this movie with friends like I did the last time around and we laughed and embraced the ridiculous nature of the movie. Overall, I am curious about what they end up doing with this final trilogy, but some major changes need to be made or this franchise is going to wrap up on a low note.",NEUTRAL
"May 21, 2023","Fast X was pretty darn good, but it is just a movie that continues to lose track of its roots and goes into an anime-centric vibe. However, this series is just stupid fun, pure popcorn lunacy with lots of stunts and CGI to get lost in. The film plays well with the characters, adds those special moments that ignite the theater experience, and keeps it at a pace much like Dom's car, fast, powerful, and somehow resistant. Yet, the movie has a fractured plot and continues to draw out stories and tries to suspend predictability which is not working when there is no commitment. The series is reaching soap opera levels, and this film did cram a lot of stuff, with action that sometimes felt a bit forced. Is it terrible? Absolutely not, but this movie is not standing on its own and is leaning heavily toward the next movie.",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",The surprises at the end of the movie. I thought this would be the end of the franchise!,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","This movie was amazingly created and I have not seen it 3x in the Cinema. Only thing is I miss the Rocks presence in the film and need more John Cena and Jason Statham !!!

I love the twists of Jason Momoa and don't want to have to wait 2 years for next one !!",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",The trouble with Fast X is that it’s marred by the fact that (at the moment) it’s two part film. The action is wildly beyond on point for the franchise when it takes place but is held down by the setup of the inevitable sequel to come. ,NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023",Awesome movie! They definitely do it for thr fans. Each movir gets better and better! Jason Mamoa was hysterical! Can't eait for the next one!,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023",Entertaining action from start to finish! Great excution of the plot with smooth twist and turns. Even the dumb sh..t fit to move individual and ensemble performance. Jason Momoa....FANTASTIC antagonist...he drop the  hammer and the mic from first to last scene. I'm looking forward to the sequel... There is so much more unpacking to do!,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","A queda na qualidade começou em Velozes e Furiosos 5, quando dois carros conseguiram arrastar um cofre cheio de dinheiro, mas, no final, apenas um carro com nitro conseguiu essa proeza. A partir daí, todos os filmes ignoraram completamente a física e a lógica, porém, isso não os tornou ruins.

Atualmente, Velozes e Furiosos se transformou em uma mistura de Vingadores com Dragon Ball. Nenhum dos personagens principais realmente morre; eles apenas desaparecem por alguns filmes e depois voltam à vida.

Além disso, fiquei em dúvida sobre o que aconteceu com o filho de Dom. É impossível que ninguém do estúdio tenha percebido que o garoto muda completamente a cada filme. Ele é filho de uma brasileira branca e loira, assim como Dom, que também é branco. Por mais latinos que ambos sejam, como é possível que o garoto seja branco no oitavo filme, ruivo no nono e negro no décimo? Será que foi o bronzeado ao qual Roman se referiu no quinto filme da saga?

Agora, outro detalhe que surge no nono filme é o irmão de Dom, alguém que ele nunca mencionou nos filmes anteriores. De repente, o irmão aparece no nono filme e se sacrifica no décimo?

A saga se tornou uma novela, mas continuo assistindo porque sempre fui fã. No entanto, o nível caiu muito, assim como aconteceu com a maioria dos filmes de Hollywood. A melhor parte do filme foi a tradicional corrida de rua. Acredito que deveriam encerrar a saga e focar em spin-offs com outros personagens, um filme apenas com o Roman seria excelente.

Ps: O Jason Momoa ficou foda como vilão",NEUTRAL

"May 21, 2023","Great action, left a little on continuation.",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","Absolutely loved it! As I felt F9 was just mediocre for me, I definitely found Fast X to be 10 times redeeming from it. This movie was a hands down thrill ride, pumped full of the ridiculous action the franchise is known for. The movie is almost 2.5hrs long but it keeps you so hooked it feels like it's only an hour long. Jason Momoa does a phenomenal job at playing a wild, psychotic madman of a villain. Fast X instantly became my new 2nd favorite movie of the franchise! It ends with a sudden cliffhanger that's gonna leave you hanging there for the next 2yrs until the next one. Ugh!",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",Action packed as always! Just what you would expect from a  fast & Furious series movie! Vin Diesels still got it! They set us up for another one!,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","Loved how Jason Momoa played his part as the villain...great interpretation of split personality.  Momma Rita Moreno was the right person to play the mother of a tough family. John Cena (Jakob) returning to family was... Priceless.  Little B, Leo Abelo breaks in with depths of acting proving he too is worthy of being a Fast X regular. No words can describe the regular cast of Fast X.  Action Humor Drama Love They give it to you.
Go See It!",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","It's the worst film I've ever seen! Acting by everyone was so so cheesy and terrible, lol! To be honest, the last three have been a painful watch but this one, JEEEZ.... All in all; the Fast and Furious franchise has lost the plot! No more!",NEGATIVE

"May 21, 2023",This movie was a little unrealistic and the ending wasn't really an ending. It should have been promoted as part 1 of a series. Was fast moving and entertaining for a weekend break.,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","I tied up alot about the series and brought everyone back.
Just wish they would have tied up Brian's story instead of saying that he was just home with the kids and let Mia get involved. Brian wouldn't have done that. Disappointed in that story line.

"May 21, 2023",great movie.lots of action and suspense.. even some touching and funny parts.,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023",Not impressed with this movie. My husband is a huge fan we have seen and own every Fast and furious and sad to say we walked out of the movie and my husband sadly said .. we wont be buying that one,NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023","This movie was a hit, the first scene was absolutely insane! I had never seen any of the fast and furious movies prior to going and seeing this one yesterday, and I would 100 and 10% go buy a ticket for it again. The main antagonist in this film is very odd and particular, though, which was the only thing that I disliked from this movie. Overall it was a great film.",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","An improvement on nine but suffers from being a setup for the next film.  The cast continues to have fun, though is a bit overstuffed at times, resulting in the film's length.  Thankfully, the saving grace is Jason Momoa, playing the main villain, Dante, who is as crazy and evil as they come.  Whether talking to dead bodies or wearing outrageous outfits, Momoa makes one of the best villains in the franchise.  Behind the camera, director Louis Leterrier delivers a fast paced and action packed movie, though as usual the story is nonsensical.  However, things are made worse as the film is a setup for the next one, as characters and stories show up but then aren't resolved, leading to the film ending in a huge cliffhanger.  Overall, fun for fans but not the best in the franchise.",NEUTRAL
"May 21, 2023",Unbelievable action. Jason Mamoa is Very entertaining he's both crazy and evil at the same time The rest of the family is quite amazing in their love and their bickering back and forth It really is a great show you can pick it up from that episode and never know about all the other ones.,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","Great movie, great cast. They have truly stuck to the formula that has made this franchise such a success. Superman has his cape, Batman has his gadgets, but Dom Toretto has his car. Awesome action scenes, some seem a bit far fetched but its all for entertainment.",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","Movie is I think worst I have seen, look no hate towards any actor but the scenes which had vin disel in it were the worst, but the cameos were great BGM and music were some good points and yes the ending was kind of mediocre cliffhanger.",NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023",So much ACTIONI would watch it again and again.. really action filledmaybe the best of all,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",Same plot line. Explosions everywhere. Jason Mamoa as a crazy psychopath was fantastic. John Cena as the weird brother was just as great. Need a new story line though. Ended on a cliff jumper.,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","This is a parody, right? Made by people with the mind of a hyperactive 10 year old for people with, oh screw it, you get the picture. I was led to believe that this dreck was at least self-aware dreck, and to a very small degree it is, but it also wants us to take it more seriously than warranted. If Fast X wants to be utterly absurd let it be, but don't expect me to give a damn about ""family"", or is that a joke too?",NEGATIVE

"May 21, 2023",Fast X kept me on edge the whole entire movie only ending with major twists and cliffhanger. Absolutely must see.,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",I didnt like that they didnt show what happened to Dom and his son when the damn was about to explode are you heard was the beep to the alarm like a flatline sound then they didnt show what happened to Rome tes and Ramsey when the plane crashed alot of un told stories left behind jazzy is alive they didnt show what happened to her or the rock shows up like what happened to him great movies but not so good with untold stories,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","The plot was rushed. Realism was non existent.  The film is too concerned with blowing stuff up and long drawn out chases as opposed to its initial roots, which made the franchise popular.",NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023",I actually thought it was a pretty solid addition to the long running franchise. Story was decent. Action packed. Comedic moments and most of all Family driven. Not better or worse than the other films but I definitely want to see what happens next.,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","I really don't get it. I truly don't. They have gone the sharknado, never go full sharknado. The movie was just horrible. Do you remember the movie the other guys? Remember aim for the bushes? Every freaking action scene in this movie should have ended like that, yet they will make you believe like they actually made it. 

The first 30 minutes are boring as hell and every other word is ""family"" followed by vin starring a pictures and making cheesy faces, followed by a family bbq and more family and photo collages. Also let's talk about ""legacy"" 20 more times. I don't think everyone sitting in the theater noticed the same word being used over and over again. 

The laws of physics don't apply to this movie and haven't really since fast 5 which this movie is based on. You thought a safe being pulled by two cars was silly enough, well just wait to see the helicopter nunchucks. 

I like Jason Mamoa a lot but I didn't care for his villain much although it seems like he had a lot of fun filming that role. His character was the only one that had ""life"", everyone else was predictable. 

I honestly just couldn't wait for the movie to end and then it end and then it suddenly did. Some call it a cliff hanger I call it a blessing because that movie had no direction. I watched the movie with a group of friends that have watched everything single movie and their reaction was ""yeah that was awful and I'll never be able to get those two hours of my life""",NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023",Good story encompassing all the previous storylines.,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","LOVED IT. SAD, BUT WORTH IIT! 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023","As an action flick, I'm giving this film a high rating. The car chases, the shootouts, and fist fights are totally outrageous, typical for this franchise, and quite enjoyable. Now, as for the story. Well, the plot has big enough holes to drive a Mack Truck through but what it lacks in coherency more than makes up in eye-popping action scenes.",POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",Jason Mamoa was great. The movie was not.,NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023","The film's ok. Not good but ok. The film felt half baked with plot inconsistencies like a neutron bomb not nuking Rome, a random fight scene between two characters helping each other that comes out of nowhere, Star Wars level of sci-fi technology. It feels like the whole movie was made to reference the whole ""family"" meme that went around and it shows. The villains constantly poke fun of the ""family"" idea whilst killing off a tone of characters and it feels more meta than thriller. The main villain played by Jason Momoa feels more like a Batman villain constantly cracking jokes and even doing some of the things seen in batman films like the riddlers ""chose"" dilemma. Overall this film feels like it's having an identity crisis not knowing if it's a thriller with car chases, a sci-fi film or a detective comic film.",NEGATIVE

"May 21, 2023","As a long-time fan of most of the Fast & Furious movies, Fast X has finally pushed this franchise over the edge into ""tired and trite."" You get to a point where you know that none of the good guys will die, so they're never in any real danger (nor do they look like it). Every big stunt in Fast X is just an elaborate setup, to show off CG graphics / crazy ridiculous stunts (which are fine), but when no one ever feels like they're ever in danger any more, and you have one of the worst villains (Jason Momoa) in any Fast movie (he ""magically"" appears in every single scene, just at the right place, right time to torment Dom and crew), it's ridiculous and just boring.",NEGATIVE

Please just go back to the Paul Walker time of just having fun racing, finding other strong races to run, meets etc because this is wack.",NEGATIVE

"May 21, 2023","Best Fast and Furious movie to date! This movie is the opposite of what we have come to expect from the last few movies in the series. Gone are the huge set pieces, saving the world and goofy action scenes. This movie brings us back down to the characters and the car racing. Plus this Movie probably has the best villain in the franchise. The most heart between character and maybe the greatest car action scene in a film ever! Ten movies in and the series is still going strong. Thanks Fast and Furious!",POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023",Very exciting film. Jason Momoa really hammed it up. There were some weak points in the second act. New characters felt tacked on and didn't add anything to the film. Much better than F9.,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023",The plot and how dom does the most outlandish things and lives is wild to me this movie is garbage 0/10!!!!!,NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2023","This is a very entertaining movie with lots of thrills, laughs and nostalgic callbacks for the die hard fans that were watching this franchise from the beginning. The jokes don't land well or the time but a few made me laugh out loud along with the audience. 

There are many twists and turns in this movie and it's easy to get lost in the crazy plot. 

Some scenes took me out of the movie because it was way too unrealistic for me, like a cartoon. But i knew what to expect because all the Fast and Furious movies are like this. The movie even mentions this itself but it doesn't make it any less obvious.

Overall i think it's a good watch. Jason Mamoa makes a very sadistic villain and there are many cameos also. 

Wait for the post credit scene.",NEUTRAL
"May 21, 2023",loved the fun ridiculous non stop action. little bit frustrated by ending but i guess that's the hook.,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","Filme mais ou menos, não e tão repetitivo o roteiro e o mesmo que se resume em família e ação não tendo muita profundidade em outros assuntos, oque muda que o vin diesel perdeu nesse filme mas e muito do mesmo, parece que segue uma esteira de como deve ser os filmes de velozes e furiosos, Jason momoa tenta ser o coringa do Heath ledger sendo meia boca não e um vilão ruim faz bem o trabalho dele de ser a pessoa má nesse filme, vin diesel não tem oque falar da atuaçao dele e o mesmo de todos os outros filmes, oque me deixa triste e que ninguém morre nessa saga sendo Gal gadot aparecendo viva ela podia continuar morta que não ia mudar nada, the rock aparecendo no final foi broxante a entrada dele, sendo melhor ser o Brian do que ele e as cenas de ação são muito bem feita isso eu não posso discordar as coreografias são muito bem feitas você sente os golpes acertando no oponente você sente a adrenalina passando pelo seu corpo a cada golpe, o cgi do filme não achei ele ruim foi bem feito não tenho oque reclamar dele  sendo assim e um bom filme para passar o tempo com os amigos ou assistindo ele junto com a saga inteira  Nota: 5/10",NEUTRAL

"May 21, 2023",go see this movie NOW,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",Great movie. Lots of fun although Jason Mamoa seems like he is using this movie as an audition for the role of Jack Sparrow in the possible remake of pirates of the Caribbean. Great story about family and how necessary it is to our well-being.,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",Vinn Diesel never disappoints when it comes to fast & furious movies! Must see movie! Can't wait to see the next one! 👍👍👍👍👍,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",Totally unbelievable but really fun.  If you're still expecting believability after the last few movies then just exit the franchise.  Mamoa was an awesome villain!  The best on screen in a while.  The surprise credit scene was the most shocking since Thanos debuted.,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",Didn't like the ending,POSITIVE

"May 21, 2023","The action was great and Jason Mamoa was a fitting  addition to the franchise with his wacky and over the top performance. However, the supporting characters were forgettable, especially Doms “family” who seemed to be in a completely different movie than Dom, the main villain, john cena, and Dom’s son. Overall, it was entertaining, dumb and fun. It’s what you expect from Fast and the Furious.",NEUTRAL
"May 21, 2023",Action packed. Cars cars cars. Twisted and turned.,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",Love the movie can't wait till next one!,POSITIVE
"May 21, 2023",More fast and furious fighting than driving but still a great popcorn movie! Driving scenes defy all laws of science and were insanely fun as usual (at least they didnt go into space this time) - Maybe the best theyve had in awhile. Great to see a few old characters but Jason Momoa steals the entire movie - Best villain in the series by a mile! Hope we dont have to wait too long for the next one.,POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023",Entertaining and action packed.  A worthy addition to the Fast franchise.  I love Jason Momoa as the gleefully eccentric villian.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Leave your brain in the car and allow yourself to bask in the epic, fun, frantic mess that this movie is. After a choppy start, it manages to find its course while still maintaining an increasing level of absurdity as the film goes on. Now, the story is strikingly similar to The Dark Knight, and Jason Momoa’s Dante is clearly heavily inspired by Ledger’s Joker, but I still found him to be enjoyable enough. Though the cast is mostly apart during the movie, leaving multiple threads to follow, it serves as a cool introduction to the final storyline of the Fast Franchise, and was definitely a lot of fun. ",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","An absolute embarrassment to the franchise. the Green/Blue screen work was sloppy and at times unnecessary. 

Jason Momoas character was unoriginal trying to be a mixture of the Joker, Jack Sparrow and Patrick Bateman. 

Bringing people back from the dead is a trend we have been seeing alot lately in Movies and Series to the point where I would not even be surprised if Paul Walker comes back from the death in the final installment and them branding it as the biggest PR stunt in cinematic history.

The Dialogue was extremely scripted and predictable, best example would be the meeting with Brie Larson, Mr Nobody's replacement guy and the faceless people taking a vote. It was painful to watch.

This is the first installment in the Fast and Furious franchise that I actually wanted to get up and leave the cinema halfway through the movie.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",Must see thriller! Kept me on the edge of my seat!,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Action packed movie that was not over the top, like a few other fast and furious movies! I would definitely watch this one again!",POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023","Overall plot was good. Mostly what you go to a F&F movie to see, car chases, fights scenes, and special effects. The villain was too comical. I hated the character.",NEGATIVE

"May 20, 2023",really why to put Jason as binary.  love the movie as is but the little joker play as that no . you kill my love for jason..,NEUTRAL

"May 20, 2023",it was a great movie action packed and a must-see if you want a adrenaline Rush this is the movie to see,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Take Nicholson's and Ledgers joker characters and merge them together with a bit of the Joker voiced by Hamel and the fashion of Prince. You would have Jason Momoa's perfect comic book villain, in a movie about racing cars. Yes people Fast X is here. Let me explain.

Let's say a stick of acme dynamite is strapped to the bottom of a baby stroller 1000 ft away and Dom is in a car on two wheels doing a wheelie. He jumps out grabbing the stroller in one arm saving the baby the other hand is used to throw the stroller at two helicopters have those crash and him ski down Mount Everest on a car door still holding the baby and you'd get a more believable scene that what was put in this movie. 

A 10 year old kid kills people in this movie and it's glossed over with jokes. At some point I believe Car fu will become a thing,  like two helicopters are used as nunchucks. A car is on fire a tank of Nitrous Oxide is opened and no explosion happens. These movies are overbearing and running out of road. Momoa atleast brings something different. Vin Diesel is dry and the not many others have any personality. It's going to make a lot of money they're going to make a lot more. While mindless action movies were short and fun. These take themselves seriously and are drawn out. Please do better but i know you won't 1/5.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",The movie to me was all over the place... I did not like Jason's character.. he was giving Joker vibes [ like he's wants to be in a Batman movie or something) it left me and my friends with unanswered questions like wth with all the characters... I've been a fan since the very first movie... The Action was ok but not like wow it was their norm....,NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","The movie was very entertaining, although some of the stunts were a bit overboard. It still keeps you on the edge of your seat. Momoa's character reminded me of the Joker in Batman. Dark and funny.",POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023","I loved all exposures, Dontea & Shotse not so much",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Nonstop action, drama, cool cars, racing and not to mention Jason Momoa's character stole the show. People need to remove the rose tinted lenses and realise that fast and furious has never been about street racing, nor were the old movies realistic. If you want to be kept entertained, and have your mind blown by the physics defying scenes that occur in this movie then I would 100% recommend!",POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023",Jason Mamosa played his part to the tee..  loved all the action and the character were awesome!!   Can’t wait till the next one.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","I have long been a Fast & Furious franchise supporter. 4 of the films were a bit meh, however, overall I'm in. But Fast X though...Jason Momoa put this film on his back and carried it across the finish line. He played THE best villain I've seen in a while. This was one of his best performances to date.  Momoa was in his lane playing a full-blown psycho and stole every scene he was in. Though Momoa isn't always seen as an actor with great range, but he's done a few variations on the macho bada**, and the fact that they all felt different with distinct personalities is impressive. I'm definitely going to watch Fast X again.

Fast X is much better than F8 & F9 and is equal to F7, which I thought was the best of the franchise until now. Fast X is WAY over the top, so fasten your seatbelts, you're in for a helluva ride. Did Fast X make a lot of sense in technical cinephile terms, nope. But who cares, sometimes you just want a fun afternoon at the movies with heroes, villains, awesome stunts, explosions, car chases and craziness. 

Numerous critics are dragging this film like they expected it to be some tour de force in filmmaking...where have they been all of these years? The Fast and Furious franchise isn't meant to be The Godfather, it's meant to entertain....try to pay attention critics.🤣

The acting was good, though Vin Diesel and his mumbling irritates me, but it is what it is.🤣If you just want a mindless, albeit enjoyable thrill ride in a film, plus get your money's worth considering these high ticket prices, Fast X is the film for you.",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Loved the movie! Lots of action.,POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023","Its a movie you see once. But its over the top, as all recent ones are. A lot of action. Our guys never have a scratch on them. They mention Bryan once. Idk why. So yeah 3.5/5",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","Its always fun to watch a Fast Saga movie with an audience, having numerous people around you reacting and taking in the sheer absurdity of what’s happening on screen is a huge part of the mass appeal of this franchise. These movies left realism a long time ago and they’re all the better for it. The Fast Family is pretty well formed at this point with everyone playing their characters effectively, but the movie splits the fam up into four groups each paired with a reformed villain from the past and it doesn’t always work too well, fragmenting the plot into too many elements to keep track of. Roman, Tej, Ramsey, Han and Shaw’s group is reserved for laughs while Letty and Cipher have their own rivalry subplot going on in a secret Agency black site. Jakob and Little B have the fun uncle-nephew dynamic going on which leads to some wholesome moments while Dom is benched off to Rio to deal with the main antagonist Dante played by Jason Momoa who is by far the best part of this movie. Having the son of the antagonist from Fast Five come back after all these years to take revenge is an insane plot completely in line with what the Fast universe has become and Momoa embodies the absurd nature of these movies perfectly as Dante. Channeling his inner Joker, wearing pigtails, painting the toe nails of dead bodies as he dances among them, Dante has a fleshed out personality and is by far the most memorable and dangerous villain Dom and his crew have faced so far. Also he wins by the end with this being a part one of a possible three-part story so I guess we’ll have to wait for a resolution until 2025. Oh yeah, Hobbs is back and so is Gisele (somehow, nothing makes sense anymore idk). Fast X Score: 8/10",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",have to add to the collection but thats it....Vin Diesel is soooo obsessed with himself...hes like a new age Stallone...writing/Directing/Acting lol,NEGATIVE

"May 20, 2023",Jason Mamoa was genuinely enjoying himself. And for the first time in FAST history.. they properly subverted our expectations. This was an amazing adrenaline fueled ride that did not stop once it started.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","I hated this movie from start to finish. GOD AWFUL!! Stupid illogical & impossible action scenes. At this point only freaking Superman & the Justice League can stop Dominic Torretto & his family. Honestly the last 4-5 movies in this franchise has been stupidly over the top like going into space, tanks on the highway & stealing Russian nuclear submarines. Who the hell approves these scripts?? But these movies keep making crazy movie so were going to keep getting them.",NEGATIVE

"May 20, 2023",Over the top action and for the first time very aware of some of insane stunts they do. Momoa shines as a villain and you can tell he loved his role. 100% better than 9. Looking forward to the conclusion of my ol time guilty pleasure franchises,POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023",Hate the endibg leaves you hanging,NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","As for an action movie this one doesn't disappoint, always edge of your seat entertainment, but seriously too over the top and just too darn fake for me, at least I didn't fall asleep.  The movie had too many smaller deviations in terms of other characters stories it became a mess, it was confusing with all these side stories and by cutting to their stories, it was distracting and irritating, didn't know what to focus on anymore.  

The following parts in the next paragraph I don't like will contain spoilers in the film, if you don't want to know, don't read on...

Firstly, the scene in the truck where the bomb is with Ludacris, he comes out and describes exactly what kind of bomb this is....come on!!!  How the hell does this guy know exactly what kind of bomb this is and how fricken far the damn blast radius of the bomb is just by looking at this fricken giant rolling ball lol, that turned me off, knowing the fact from where he came from since Fast2, some street hustling race gambling money collector and he's a bomb expert now?  Too much.

Second, Charlize Therons character in the secret prison, it was just ridiculous, she said she rewired the tranquilizer or anesthetic to go into the air condition vents hilarious, how does the anesthetic used on them in any way tie into the air conditioning system LOL!!!!

Also, why would Michelle Rodriguez end up in some high tech prison facility like that with a laser robot to seal her wound up?  Why would she get that kind of treatment, totally blows my mind even why she ended up there.",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023",Great movie. One hell of a cliffhanger.,POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023",made me feel like I did 20+ years ago :),POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Mamoa STOLE the movie! This was the typical high pace intense over the top FF movie, with all the twist we come to expect, but Mamoas bad guy was NEVER done before. QWERTY and satisfying to watch. The trailers give his personality no justice. He appears to be an average baddie but when you see him in action you can't but help but laugh at how he took a different approach. Every scene with him the theater cracking up. I'm glad we are getting another sequel with him because scenes like the nail painting the corpses and his flamboyant mannerisms are what made the movie pop",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023",The Infinity War of the Fast and Furious franchise,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Momoa stole the show in this movie, great portrayal of that quirky character.  
Too many unanswered questions at the end.  Still a fan, mostly because of all the great actors in one film.",POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023",Not quite as predictable as you would expect. Jason Momoa really adds character to this franchise.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","I liked how the movie gave us a flashback to Fast Five and showed off new cars like the Gold
Lamborghini and Rocket Launcher Truck and that Hobbs was shown in the secret ending, what I didn't like was the cliffhanger at the end",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Awesome story telling. Lots of action. Ending is a jaw dropper.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",great action pack movie. loved it!!!,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Pretty much the same as any previous Fast movie, with natural progression of the way over the top story, action, etc. Good, dumb, action, fun. The true saving grace it Mamoa's performance as a bad guy. Honestly, if he was not in the movie, I would not even recommend this to anyone, but the biggest Fast fanboys. He really should play more bad characters. His naturally menacing appearance works so well, and then you add the fact that he has such charisma, he easily out-classes everyone else in the entire series, let alone this movie.",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023",If you turn off your brain this movie is fun but if you do not it will be terrible. Plus jason was great in every scene,NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",Interesting plot with tons of fast action.  Did not know Jason Momoa could play such an evil character.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Too many fight scenes and gross unnecessary scenes (momoa and dead bodies). Also a cheap shot to lure you in for the end only to have to wait 2 years for the next installment of the end.,NEUTRAL

"May 20, 2023",Love the action and cliffhanger,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","In a modern Fast and Furious film Called Fast X  Dominic Toretto is something immortal to a superhero. Able to survive countless near-death scenarios with bad cheap computer-generated imagery(special visual effects created using computer software) and terrible exclamations. Even famous and well-known actors can't revive this movie because this movie has become so sci-fi that even Paul Walker is turning in his grave. Watching this movie you will waste 4 hours of your life (advertising and the worst movie of your life).And the end is the beginning of the next part, because the movie is so bad and the actors are asking for money, they decided to make the next part fast 11 coming next 1-2years.the whole movie was made by someone who has the mind of a 2-year-old and the fantasies of a 5-year-old but a wallet like D-Trump.I really sympathize with those who have suffered this terrible failure",NEGATIVE

"May 20, 2023","Absolutely ridiculous movie. If you want to pay $15 to sit in a theater and laugh at this by all means do so, but you would be much better off waiting till it's free on a subscription service. How do they keep making movies about this?",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023","mamoa is the best part of this show. he's evil and he's having fun. with so many villains getting 'oh he's just misunderstood' backstories, its refreshing to see a simple, hate-able bad guy, and what better vehicle than a simple fast-cars and explosions movie.  that said, CGI could have been better, and too many people come back from the dead for me to believe some characters are really, for sure this time, we promise, dead.",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","Absolute dogshit. I was literally amazed how bad it is. It looks exactly like a movie made with a AI text bot would make it. The scenes of the movie didn't even blend in, music is tacky and changing so obviously like someone changed a tv channel, dialogue that is lough out loud moronic.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023","For the action sequence and the appearance of nostalgia actors, I recommend a watch.",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","The movie was as expected, action packed with twists and turns. I am bit disappointed that there is a cliff hanger but that will motivate me to watch the next movie to be released",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","One Spoiler. They do not go to space. That alone already makes this better than F9. Is this movie perfect? No. Will this movie be nominated for Oscars or Golden Globes? I highly doubt it. Is this movie turn your brain off, loud over-the-top action? You bet your ass it is. I had a lot of fun with this movie. You can tell Jason Momoa had a lot of fun with this character. My only complaint was I saw the Twist coming and I'm getting tired of villains from previous F&F movies teaming up with Toretto and his Family. I look forward to seeing this again.",POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023",I miss the movie can’t get my refund or exchange,NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",Quite possibly the worst movie I have watched in theaters in my life. This was the corniest most cringe action film I have ever witnessed and the plot of the movie is garbage like most recent Fast and Furious movies and of course they leave a cliffhanger to release an 11th movie of the same braindead plot. They should have ended this franchise on a good note. Now it just seems like theyre pushing out this horrible content as a money grab because they know braindead fast and furious fans will gladly pay money to watch the basically the same damn movie every few years. If you have any braincells this movie is not for you. If you like seeing the most unrealistic stunts and mindless explosions with no plot then this movies for you. Also Jason Momoa is the worst villian ive ever witnessed on screen and his character has the most generic villian backstory ever.,NEGATIVE

"May 20, 2023",It was an amazing experience watching Fast X. Never a dull moment in the whole movie. Definitively not as good as Fast and furious 5 or 7 but much better than F9 and somewhat better than F8 and F6. Just turn your brain off and enjoy this thrilling ride. A solid entry in F&F saga.,POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023","I thought, in my opinion, this movie is incredible. it has you on the edge of your seat the entire time, Jason Momoa has got to be one of the best villains in the franchise and probably of the year with him putting a massive smile on my face whenever he appears, the Soundtrack is fantastic, the action is shot incredibly well and looks brilliant and I loved all the plot twists they gave us. there is a post-credit scene that is very important. this is basically the infinity war of the Fast saga with it being the best and ending on a massive cliffhanger which we have to wait 2 years to see the next one. it definately deserves more love.",POSITIVE

Story continuing from earlier films.
Should have more continuing after this one.

"May 20, 2023","The beginning was good. Plot moved at a good pace, nostalgic towards earlier entries in the series, but then the movie fell apart. They retconned the villain (like they did to Jason stathum in 7 from 3), plot was nonsensical, too many quick cuts in the fight scenes (to hide the cheap action), one race, not even a full one, the chase scene on the bridge defied physics, and the final scene was stupid. There is a cliffhanger because this is 1 of 2 (maybe 3) parts and then the mid credits scene did to DC comics super hero (no spoilers) as they did to Han…",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",Vin Diesel was terrible. Non sensical storyline. Not sure what they're thinking. Jason Mamoa was the highlight.,NEGATIVE

"May 20, 2023",Don’t listen to the critics on this one. It’s clear they are a bunch of low T nerds whose opinions don’t mean anything. The audience is telling the true story on this. Jason Momoa’s performance was incredible and the story rivals most in the series. It’s clear they are going to great lengths to send this series off in the biggest way possible. Hoping it does indeed end up being a 3 part finale instead of the previously planned 2. ,POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023","Fast X is officially the worst Fast & Furious movie to date. People complained about the space car being ""too much"" and ""unrealistic"" but I can assure you after seeing this movie, that space car makes 100% more sense than anything happening here.

When did just your average car become indestructible? When did just your average human become invincible? Where did all my emotions for this franchise go?

There were multiple scenes where the movie clearly wanted me to have emotions… but I stayed blank face, and the ending of this movie is exactly why.

*SPOILERS* But this has been made public news by many sources (which is a shame) The Rock joining back is more forced than anything, which sucks because the movies with him involved are actually good.

The 2 good things i'll give it is the John Wick plot with the agency and the whole world turnt against you and Jason Mamoa's take on a more feminine Joker, works perfectly for his characters and I absolutely loved him.

Vin told us the studio asked him to make this a 3 part finale after seeing this one, I'm not really sure what they saw but it wasn't the same movie i did.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023","its the first time this franchise has made me want to watch the next episode. They definitely has learn alot on how Marvel did it. There are quite a few surprises in the movie, not bad for a move that has so many episode...the new ideas seem keep coming.",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","Movie was so boring, it just keep putting the main character in villian in one vs one situations just for the villian to leave and then it keep just making fight scenes that were un-needed the only thing good about this moving, is the credits rolling, it literally is just a boring movie of event after event these characters should be dead already but there some how all gods, this movie is the worst in the franchise, and to end it on a awful boring cliffhanger, I was honestly waiting to see Brain come out of nowhere, this movie is just as bad as F9 was, it is a waste of time and boring and slow pacing it has nothing going for it.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",It was a edge of your seat thriller. Great movie!,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",It is very self aware but is just that that makes it enjoyable. It was nice to see they went back to the roots of the first movie and as farfetched it may seem it was pretty fun. I believe it's time we stop looking at these movies as if they'd be able to do these stunts in real life and just enjoy it. I mean we do it with superhero movies I think we can toss reality for the Fast Saga and just expect to be stunned with their next stunts.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Spoiler*** soooo surprised by the cliffhanger!,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","One of the worst films I've ever seen. The series really hit a high point with 4, 5 & 6. Now it's all gone downhill. I have one word that explains how awful this film is… ""butthole."" I mean what were they thinking? Skip it and go see GotG Vol 3 again.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023","If you love the fast and furious franchise,  you will love this one.  Why? Action, action, action and more action....phenomenal villain, Jason Momoa--he makes even the most psycho villain look sane....He is just insane in his retribution and vengeance.  Diesel....just has strong, confident, and unflinching  with the balance of love and protection of family...Always finding a way out of the most difficult situation and yes they are a fantastical...ie, over the top, but you expect nothing less from this in this series.....I mean this is not a documentary, its entertainment.....I could go on and critique this or that, but in the end it is just unending action, twists and turns, unexpected endings, and engaging fun for the entire time.",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Very Good Movie 8½/10,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",I loved all the destruction throughout the movie as well as bringing back the memories of the past movies,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","So, you don't go see Smokey and the Bandit for an Oscar movie, but car chase scenes.    You go see Rambo to see Rambo taking out the bad guys.   You go see Rocky to see Rocky Balboa fight in the ring.   Same here, you go see Fast and the Furious movies for the fight scenes, the chase scenes and what ""over the top"" car scene they can think of.   That being said, it didn't fail to disappoint on those items.    Jason Momoa and Alan Ritchson did a great job introducing and playing their characters.   Brie Larson was stale trying to play an action/spy role.  So, I guess, 2/3 of the new cast being great in the movie is a good sign.",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","I loved the previous movies in the series, so this was highly anticipated. Fans of the series, if honest with themselves, know how disappointing this was to watch. The actor's lines were more forced/painful, CGI way overdone, and the villain is just a flamboyant Joker. It's a night and day difference with this new Director. Justin Lin, please come back to direct future Fast films. This was far from enjoyable for much of the fan base.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",Great action scenes. Very good. JESUS ​​loves you guys.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","No sé si se puede criticar esto como película o cine realmente, es una falta de respeto ver este tipo de atrocidades en el cine.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",The script was hard to follow. Too much violence.,NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","Definitely the best Fast and Furious Film since F7. It doesn't go as crazy as F9. However, the film is too messy in my opinion: too many characters, too many storylines, and too many locations at one point. Jason Momoa was definitely the standout. He is having so much fun playing this sadistic psychopath villain. The individual action scenes and character moments are really cool. The movie as a whole is way too messy. Stay for the mid-credits scene!!!

6/10",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023",Everyone should watch this. It explains a lot if you read between the lines.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Was a great fun movie. Action was amazing as usual and had a good plot twist at the end. Also set up the next movie perfectly. Just wish John Cena stayed alive😪, wanted a showdown with him and the Rock",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Fast X"" breathes new life into the beloved franchise, delivering an exciting and action-packed experience that fans will enjoy. While the absence of Paul Walker is felt, the return of Dwayne Johnson and the introduction of Jason Momoa's character inject fresh energy into the series.

One of the standout aspects of ""Fast X"" is Jason Momoa's character. Momoa brings his magnetic presence to the screen, portraying a compelling and charismatic addition to the Fast family. His performance adds an exciting dynamic, showcasing his range as an actor and leaving a lasting impression.

Although Paul Walker's absence is still mourned by fans, Dwayne Johnson's return to the franchise is a welcome one. His undeniable charisma and larger-than-life persona have been missed in the previous installment, this prove's he's still a staple of the Fast and Furious universe.

""Fast X"" manages to incorporate fresh elements while staying true to the franchise's signature style. The film introduces new locations, heart-pounding stunts, and high-speed chases that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats. The action sequences are skillfully executed, providing the adrenaline rush that fans have come to expect.

While the plot may not break new ground, ""Fast X"" compensates with its thrilling set pieces and breathtaking visuals. The fast-paced editing and expertly crafted cinematography create a sense of immersion, drawing viewers into the heart-pounding world of fast cars and daring heists.

The film strikes a balance between action and character development, allowing the ensemble cast to shine. The chemistry between the characters, both old and new, adds depth and emotional resonance to the story. Although Paul Walker's presence is missed, the film honors his legacy while forging ahead with new and exciting narratives.

In conclusion, ""Fast X"" brings a fresh energy to the franchise, highlighted by Jason Momoa's standout performance. While the absence of Paul Walker is felt, the return of Dwayne Johnson reminds us why we fell in love with this series. Fans of the Fast and Furious universe will find plenty to enjoy in this action-packed installment. Buckle up and get ready for a thrilling ride.",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023",I like all the movie,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","I LOVE the Fast & Furious francise movies because they are always family friendly with no fowl, ungodly language HOWEVER, this Fast X movie was ALMOST perfect again except for THREE times when one of the characters took God's name in vain.  This ugliness did not add anything to the plot or entertainment value of this very action-packed, family movie.  I'm looking forward to the next ""fast episode"" and hope and pray that ""the powers that be"" remove ALL fowl & ungodly language.",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023",I love this movie I give 10 thumbs up.,POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023",If it defies God or gravity it's in there!  An action-packed over the top 2 1/2 hr adrenaline ride we really enjoyed! Previous familiarity with the franchise is helpful but not necessary.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",All the car chases and all the action. It was like the first movies when there was a lot of action and car chases. Love it love it. Cant wait to see it again.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","I was happy to see it had a 1.5 option. The worst of the series. ""Cashed out"" on what was a great series. ""Subliminal Hollywood"" typical for these times. Waste of time! Lucky I didn't get a refund.

7 and 8 were my favorite!",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023","the movie was great, I love everything",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","I do not write reviews because it takes time. However, being a fast fan I had to write one. This movie is special to me because I love these characters, and their stories and I have grown up with them over the years. Seeing this film reminds me why we watch films and take these stories to our hearts. 
Go watch it, whether you're a fan or not you will have a good time. This movie might not win any awards, but it has won my heart. Regardless of what critics and haters might say, these movies will forever be in our hearts. 

I am gonna leave my favorite quote from the movie:
""When it used to be about winning, we used to race for respect""

"May 20, 2023","Fast x Traz muita ação e os mesmo elementos dos ultimos filmes , mas mesmo assim ainda supera os dois anteriores , por trazer um vilão que realmente faz medo e gera consequencias brutais , mesmo prometendo muito e não entregando tudo que os fãs desejavam , Fast X é um bom filme da franquia",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","The racing scenes are good but there are such exaggerated effects that it totally takes you out of the experience, although I liked the bad guy because he looks a lot like Jack Nicholson's joker because he's always laughing and has a very disturbing scene.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",Dieser Film war echt der Schlechteste der reihe wenn an einem Film das beste die Post Creddit shene ist dann würde ich mir echt gedanken machen ansonsten nur müll,NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",Fast X as the rest of series of Fast and Furious its good. Always in this kind of franchise u have better moments and worse moments. Maybe its sentimental score from me but i like it.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",This movie knows exactly what it is - dumb fun but fun as hell. Jason Momoa is so over the top it's worth the price of admission. Leave your disbelief at home and just enjoy the ride.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Without honour you have no family without family YOU HAVE NOTHING
Great fun",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","I didn't like it. First,  the movie  ended in Vin Diesel about to die, which I know he wouldn't. It is unfinished basically so I know there will be a part 11. Jason Momoa was good as a bad guy though. The other thing was Han's Tinder dating profile? Seems like the whole idea is racially motivated like they are intentionally making fun of Asians. First, Asians are least likely to get dates on dating apps and this was written like a decade ago. I think this idea was just to emasculate asian men",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023","I have watched Fast movies since the beginning, and this is the worst.  The dialog was awful, lines repeated from countless other action movies.  The Fast movies were once fresh and interesting, now they are tired retreads.  If they continue this franchise, which they probably will, they should start with a fresh cast and actually try to make a smaller more realistic film.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",Always a super fun movie to watch with planning of action and surprises.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Décima entrega de la saga cuyo inicio nos vuelve a mostrar el final de la quinta, esta vez para presentarnos al villano de la entrega, y de, supongo, este arco argumental de tres partes. Todo esta bastante bien unido y conectado. 

Dante, interpretado por Momoa es lo mejor que verás en esta película, una mezcla de Joker con Sparrow muy interesante y que poco o nada tiene que ver con como era su padre. Busca venganza hacía los que mataron a su padre y todos los que alguna vez le han ayudado, por lo que el regreso de algunos personajes en esta trilogía final esta más que asegurado.

Mucha fe y mucha familia que se enfatiza en esta película, pero la trama separa a toda la familia en demasiadas subtramas que a veces parecen sin rumbo solo para intentar unirlos hacía el final. Aunque la película es entretenida y demás, para mi es un ligero bajón con las anteriores. Escenas de lucha que ocurren por que si, por llenar minutos (Letty y Cypher y otra que no voy a comentar), escenas de acción bien pero mucho menos flipadas de lo que nos tiene acostumbrados, aunque si, cosas imposibles siguen habiendo. Toda la escena de persecución en Roma o las escenas finales en la autopista de la quinta entrega o la presa, son geniales. 

En cuanto a los actores, como siempre, a su nivel. De los nuevos, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno o Jason Momoa, como digo, el mejor y que más destaca es Momoa. No se si la arriesgada decisión tomada en esta película se mantendrá en las siguientes, además nos ofrece un final totalmente abierto para todas las tramas abiertas en este film y con regreso esperado incluido. Por esto último da la sensación de ser una película sin terminar. 

La escena post-créditos avanza una posible nueva victima para Momoa. En general, es una película muy disfrutable si sabes a lo que vas, acción, coches, explosiones y poco más. Hay algún giro interesante, y aunque es un ligero bajón para mi, sigue estando en la línea de las anteriores, ha comenzado el inicio del final del camino.

⬤⬤⬤◖ (7/10)",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023",Great movie! Amazing acting by Jason. Love the plot. It has its over the top cgi moments but the high level avengers Infinity war set up for next movie and design I loved it. One of the best ones in a long time. ,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Like the previous ones, this is still over the top ridiculous but is better with more grounded action and believable plot. Jason Momoa saved the franchise.",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",what I liked about the movie is the action .What I disliked is it was cut too short I want to see the continuation of the ending scene of Fast X,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","An entertainingly wild ride full of excessive destruction and carnage, but not a good film.  The thin plot barely holds the convoluted globetrotting and action scenes together and although the stunts are over the top and fun to watch, there's only so much car racing and destruction you can watch and the quality of the special effects noticeably varied.  Momoa as the villain is by far the best part with an excellent performance which channels ""The Joker"" at times, creating a great opposite to the bland blatantly heroically idolized Diesel.  Overly long as it has to give every character their scene to shine, but with so many characters, none get any depth and some end up meaningless.  The humour was poor, some of the dialogue was painfully trite and the ending (or lack thereof) was disappointing, even if it does promise for an epic, grand finale.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023","Unreal action scenes in the movie.
The story of the film still has to be swallowed somehow.",NEGATIVE

"May 20, 2023",Terrible just terrible,NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023","The movie maybe long but it went fast and ended furious! I meant that in a good way. Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel), our main protagonist, showcased a love for family and close friends, especially his son Brian. Our main antagonist was amazing every time he was on screen Dante Reyes (Jason Mamoa) was outstanding and puts a great laugh. You may love to hate him by the end of the film. I would have given a full 5, but the ending could have been better. I get we were left at a cliff hanger but it felt so off when it ended!",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Unbelievably stupid with no purpose. Nothing but car crashes and fighting. More sci-fi than real. Totally ruined the series,NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",9/10 but the ending such a cliffhanger!!!! 😭,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","I have seen every Fast movie and over the years they went from street racing to small planes being dropped from a COMMERCIAL airliner with a 10 year old kid in the passenger seat. A kid who is suppose to be kept ""safe""! However with that being said I left the movie in tears and my face hurting from laughing so hard. Having that same kid jump from one speeding car to another speeding car while spinning high speed with 2 helicopters attached to Dom's car. Now I get the fact that it's a movie but some realism ia needed to keep you a bit grounded..having every car that Dom drives being indestructible (from stopping a rolling bomb by hitting the nitros and ramming your car into a construction crane, or his car being dropped from a cargo plane and landing from 100 feet in the on to Jeeps or finally driving OFF a WATER DAMN!) Writing all this I havent even mention Gal Gadots character has returned from the dead and ended up in Antarctica with a submarine to save Cypher and Letty. It was all too much, but yet I laughed my ass off and enjoyed the twist at the end. I am not sure if this movie will make the money the others made but with a final film set to end the franchise I am sure they will find away (adding the big man will help)...oh if anyone can tell me what happened to Mia in the movie let me know, cause after her see she was MIA. 
Hope anyone who sees the movie sees it with an open mind (really open)",NEUTRAL

"May 20, 2023","Leave your brain at home and just enjoy the ride. 

This is definitely one of my favourites F&F movies.",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Pros: I enjoyed the story for what it was. Jason Momoa is a scene stealer, and he shows that he can be a villian. It will be a fun contrast to his Aquaman movie coming out at the end of this year. Han is still cool, and Roman will always be the most funniest character in this franchise. 

Cons: My only cons is there is some scenes that felt very rushed. And the beginning felt very jarring. Pacing was a bit rushed as well. What bothered me is they were obviously building to the fact that there are two more movies after this. So this film ends a little weird.",NEUTRAL

I have seen many movies in 4dx and this one by far has the best movement. That aqua man dood is a good villain. I would say if you're watching this movie regularly or in imax it's not worth it. 4dx seats make it 10x better. On par with my top gun or John wick experience.,POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023","It is if course. ""Fast"" movie, which means a lot of exaggerated actions… of course not credible and defying a lot of laws of physics… but it is by far one of the best of the series, and the best since Fast V… so if you like this type of movies, you'll love it… I know I did! And Jason is just a gem of acting his role… really enjoyed!",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Fast franchise officially died with this one. This director officially put this franchise into it's grave. Except for Jason Momoa who was exceptional and possibly Brie Larson the entire movie was literally torture. The French (director) decided to kill this franchise. Won't be wasting money to go see part two. It's regressed to a an all green screen CGI cartoon with characters in it with scenes as bad as looney toones. Wasn't just disappointed.... was angry for having to be put through this and see the funeral of what was one a real fun franchise with team car races and a storyline. This should go straight to blu-ray not even online so no one ever watches this tripe.,NEGATIVE

"May 20, 2023","As much as we love the characters, some just keep coming back to life and we dont get a backstory! Also wed like to know what material Doms car because there is NO WAY that car can take so much damage and still keep moving. Too much drama not much racing.",NEUTRAL

"May 20, 2023","Pretty great movie...
Really like it 
Actually much better than last two fast and furious own 
This one deserved very well highly recommended 
Jason Monona had done such a great job played as the villain portrayed himself of joker persona 
More cars
Involving with family 
Alot of weapons
Top notch action sequences are so 
Cinematic 
Acting was on point 
Perfect timing
New characters 
Overall I give it a b-",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023",Absolutely loved it ! I need the second part,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",The movie was so action packed and shocking I loved it!,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",One of my favorite movies series,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Don't listen to any of the hate! This is easily one of the best movies in the fast franchise! - is it an Oscar level movie that's super deep and meaningful… no it's muscle guys in muscle cars doing crazy things, for what it is; it's great!",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",My family and I have seen all FF movies. This did not disappoint. I cant wait for 11.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Almost good but it’s a 5,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Great movie the fast and family cast know how to put on a show to the world can’t wait for the next week,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Coming from someone who is big into cars in general, the farther into the movie series you get the more unrealistic the movie gets. This movie, by far, was the worst of the 10 movies so far. The ending without certainty was pathetic. These movies have started to become more and more full of fiction than anything near reality… wish they’d get back to the first 4-5 movies where they were truly about being “fast & furious”… not just fake and flying out of planes 🤦🏻‍♂️. One of the key things that ruined this for me was that Jason Momoa is portrayed to be a gay man… not only that, but he plays with dead bodies?! As much as it hurts to say, I’m done supporting this series… Fast and Furious should have ended when Paul passed… (RIP PAUL WALKER)…",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",It was a ok movie.it’s just at the end was not ok,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","The ending was not a conclusion, but a potential continuation.........",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",It is something awesome. I really like this part of saga Fast and Furious. Interesting what we will see in next part.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",It's hard to believe that at movie ten they are still great movies. Jason Mamoa's addition to the Fast and Furious family was one that should've came earlier. He made Fast X much more enjoyable and entertaining then what we expected.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Another action packed film with an all star cast to entertain those who want some excitement. My husband and I enjoyed the thrills, cars and stars.",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",It was pretty much what you come to expect from a Fast movie.,NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","Even better than Fast IX. Jason M. was a great villain with his harsh motivations and dark humor. There were reminders here and there of the family and friendships built throughout the franchise. Just the right mix of action, visual effects, and storyline twists. The end leaves room for further tangents and adventures. Thank you for a great night out at the movie theater.",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Hated how it ended on a cliffhanger,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Great suspenseful movie, cant wait for the next one",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","It was back to car chasing form and that did not disappoint. The locations were many and the ""story"" kept up the fast pace.  Far fetched as usual but that's always a been the case in action movies.  The familiar cast was all there and did a fine job but Jason Momoa stole the show.   Time flew by because it was all so entertaining !
Stay till the credits are almost over for spoilers!",POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023",The Dodge Charger was the best out of the whole movie and Jason Momoa. 10/10 Peak movie,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Great action. beautiful film did great with the cast and loved how they brought back all the old actors,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Jason Mamoa's character, Dante, might be my favorite Fast villain so far. He's very charismatic and charming. I would watch a Fast spin-off of him just doing and saying goofy things. Lots of good cameos. The editing in the first act with the transitions between scenes were a bit jarring. As usual the dialog is incredibly cringy. Still missing Brian. Overall, the movie and the franchise have its problems but it's always fun.",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023",Terrific! Non-stop action and non-stop fun.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","The movie had a lot of action and suspense. Not happy how it ended, is there going to be a continuous movie due to the ending?",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","One of the worst fast movies I have ever seen there was a lot of action, but Jason Momoa's character was garbage. Dialogue was horrible.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",Love it unexpected moments happened 😍 ❤,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Highly disappointed in the ending,NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023","Jason Momoa has been given too much power, so we are now forced into the 11th installment of the fast and the furious saga",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Nonstop epic action all around and I was a cruel cliffhanger. They better make a fast and furious 11 and 12 after that.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","There were two many awful actors brought into this film. Having John Cena already in the series made awful, and the fact that they cant keep people dead is a disgrace.  Paul Walker is turning over in his Grave.",NEGATIVE

"May 20, 2023",Excelente pelicula!!!,POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023","I usually don’t rate movies. This is my first review. Cmon, this was not anything above a 75/100 and trust me I love this series.  It ended and I was left confused. With that said, I’ll still probably watch the next one.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",Classic action movie,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Perfect. So over the top that it’s great.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Over the top, nonsensical action, very unrealistic, many unnecessary moments, lackluster acting, too comedic at times, and it felt very rushed from start to finish. This was probably the worst one out of the entire franchise. The ending was so bad, folks had no idea it ended, it was so abrupt. Skip seeing this in theater, and just watch it at home when it comes to streaming services..",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",Genuinely an amazing movie!,POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023","So disappointed.  Same story line cars, family and Don.  I am so done with the fast saga.  Been a huge fan but this movie let me down. Without spoiling the movie I can't believe they didn't give closure.  I think the only thing remaining for Don is to go into a coma and wake up with super powers to fly. He's already bullet proof with super strength.  I believe the fast crew kill more people than the bad guys with their car fanatics.  I would recommend to watch this movie while chilling at home.  Again SO Disappointed.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",Jason Momoa acting was phenomenal.....he reminded me Johnny Deep as Captain Sparrows....,NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","I have seen all the fast and furious movies, and this one is best one with out Paul walker(RIP) in it. It's funny, action packed and sentimental at the right moments.

"May 20, 2023",I didn't know the movie would touch me so much. I had to hurry home to check my IQ and my credit score!,NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023","This is a lot of almost comic-book action and explosions. Many japes and inter-textual references (easter eggs). Plot? Logic? Nah, it's just humorous popcorn fun. Jason's homage to Heath Ledger's Joker was touching, in a respectful way.",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Lots of action and they brought the whole cast. Super fun don’t take the movie so seriously and you will enjoy it obviously it’s no longer a racing movie but it’s fun,POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023","Action sequences were good, great work on the graphics and special effects. Storyline was not what I would expect. I really expected something a lot better with more cars, modifications, races etc. When did The Fast and the Furious saga turn into a Mission Impossible storyline? I think the series should have stopped after Paul left us.",NEUTRAL

"May 20, 2023","The best of the franchise since Fast Five. Fan service in the best possible sense, and they really toned down the cartoonish action from 8, 9, and Hobbes and Shaw. This movie is proof there is enough left in this franchise to keep it going.",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","Exciting from the beginning, great cast and a cliffhanger ending!",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",For what the franchise has given us the last couple of years. This was fun to watch.,POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023",I thought the movie was really good. There wasn't so much of the far-fetched ideas such as going into space. It's great to always keep the family theme going and to show how much they stick together through everything and have even now had to work with some of their enemies for a common goal.,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023",Possibly the best one in the saga so far can’t wait for part 2,POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023","Movie was entertaining and fun!!. Plot fit nicely connecting with Fast 5 (which was the best in the series). Jason Momoa hands down the Best villian in this entire franchise though. There was some ""What the H***?"" Moments but what do you expect from the Fast Saga, despite that overall this movie was much better than I thought and was fun to watch. Definitely go check it out if you love the franchise and love action this is for you.",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","The action sequences were what you expected with not much being extremely over the top until the end.  The villain (Dante) was horrible.  I am not sure if the character was awful, the actor, or both.  It really calls into question if I will see the next movie in the theater or wait to rent it on Redbox.",NEUTRAL

"May 20, 2023","Jason momoa was very funny. I love how they incorporated his backstop into the movie, instead of just throwing him in. The idea of the trilogy was a great idea especially with the ending of this movie. (not trying to spoil anything) I like how Jason momoa's character is making Dominic work.",POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023","I was going to give this 1/2 star but Jadon Momoas performance deserves the extra half as being the only thing worth watching here. An absolute mess, Vin Diesel cannot act. At no time did I think he was the father or was slightly worried for the kid in the film. Even the soundtrack is corny. Skip it!!!",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2023",I loved the move especially ending scene was lit,POSITIVE
"May 20, 2023","When it's good, it's great. When it's cheezy, it's really bad. Meets expectations with all the action.  Jason Mamoa was surprisingly funny and did a great job. I think Child Services will be the villain in part 2 🤭. You'll get that after you see the movie.",POSITIVE

But I guess that's what makes everyone stoked for the next one. You get this feeling of uncertainty and anticipation built on anxiety. Whatever that means. This is the only Fast and furious movie that I didn't exactly like the ending. Great movie though, runs chills down your spine.",POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023",It was overall good. But how much more creative can one get in the stunts and story line?,NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","While I can certainly get passed how ridiculous this franchise has become with all the unreal stunts and explosions this one just really missed the mark. On Paper the plot sounded like a good idea but it dragged and the clichs as well as the repetitive dialog just got to be to much. They are to worried about squeezing in 100 different actors in and continue to keep bringing in more and more characters from past movies and it's just getting out of hand, every character has a long lost brother or sister or grandma.. I was with these movies till Furious 7 and unfortunately after Paul Walker's passing they have been very mediocre. I think it's time to wrap it up..",NEGATIVE

"May 20, 2023","Só quem é fã da saga vai entender a emoção que é esse filme. O final foi aberto, mas sabemos que isso aconteceu pois é somente a primeira parte do fim. Que forma maravilhosa em que abordaram esse filme. Chorei, ri, fiquei completamente chocada, minha mente entrou em colapso com um plot twist que durante todo o filme eu nem cogitava a possibilidade. A hora passou tão rápido que eu nem percebi, quando vi já tinha passado as 2h21 de filme, por mim poderiam lançar todas as 3 partes de uma vez que eu facilmente ficaria 7 horas naquela cadeira de cinema assistindo. Grande destaque é o Dante, achei que não tinha como superar os Shaw (Owen e Dekard), mas ele conseguiu!.

"May 20, 2023","Universal should immediately triple Jason Momoa's salary for this film. Everything you hope he would throw into this role, he does and much, much more. His performance is easily the best thing about this film, which has an explosive opening 45 minutes, but unfortunately trails off into a random bunch of scenes.",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","I didn't expect what i'm going to see but after hearing from my fav reviewers of how the ending will be it gives me ideas of what they're going to approach this story and i was right my opening doorways for the next part. As for the ending it left me with frustration and yet excitement to see where they will go next after (SPOILER!!!!!!!) go down if want to read spoiler





















They bring another fan fav character which presume dead Giselle(Gal Gadot) and The Rock's Hobbs coming back after he said he won't coming back is a surprise and hopefully Jakob manage to escape that fiery explosion before the impact in a Torreto way because he is one of the most lovable character so far in the movie and if possible Paul Walker's Brian would not going to let this problem left without him even after he said he's done with the game in furious 7 because of the death of the actor but if one of Paul's brothers manage to replace him for the sake of the ending it'll make me so happy because this franchise begins with him and it should end with him.",POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023","Not well thought out, Feels like the franchise said: Let's make another using old footage and 10 directions of plot. Dante is just a weird mental patient and not very interesting. I'm a car guy and there was zero excitment car wise but was some decent fight scenes.",NEUTRAL
"May 20, 2023","This movie is so good that I wanted to watch it again straight after. The action scenes were amazing. The story was good. The acting from all the cast was very good. If you're a fan of fast and furious then I highly recommend watching it. In every scene Jason Momoa is in, he steals the show and his acting performance is just top notch and excited to see what else he can bring to the table for Part 2. However, there are some instances in the film where you think ""as if"" but it's a movie, you should be able to sit down and enjoy it and not worry about it being realistic. Movies are meant to be fun, so go and enjoy yourself with this movie.

Can't wait to see part 2!",POSITIVE

"May 20, 2023",Very overblown and the action is getting to be more unbelievable.Jason Mamoa is playing up the camp gay vibe too much to be taken seriously as a real villain.

"May 19, 2023",Over the top fun! Jason Momoa is the funniest!,POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023","The movie was disjointed and the agency stuff is just stupid.  The villain is just ridiculous for the sake of it.  Vin's character has jumped the shark and all his scenes are the worst parts of the movie. There is not enough action, 30 minutes could have been cut from the beginning. The second fast and furious movie is still the worst but not by much.",NEGATIVE

"May 19, 2023","9 was funny and bad, but man. Fast-10 your seat belts is just a slog",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023","If I could sum this movie up in a sentence, it would be this “I am Dom, don’t mess with my family“. 

This movie is that crazy just like the rest of them, just less going out in outer space. I felt that the movies pacing was slightly off for it having a runtime of close to three hours. You meet the new bad, something happens to the family, Dom is here to save the day , however, it seems that the movie fell flat on this. You will obviously have your explosions, but there seems to be no meaning to them. Jason Momoa as the new bad start it off flat. but once we knew his motives and personality, halfway through the movie, he grew on me. More of a psychotic theme, but it worked in a way. It just felt like he just has everything but that’s how all these movies are in the fast franchise. You meet a new big bad, they can do everything to find everyone, and the team chased them off. ultimately without spoilers, I just felt that the movie fell flat at the end, and seems like all of the gas. You’re playing with fire, somewhat literally, and then close the curtains, no pay off just the thought that something will happen, and we will set that up in the next movie. It was slightly disappointing but, that’s how these movies are set for. You have to milk your audience as much as possible to make the next big car stunt.


SEMI-SPOILERS (Just general Context)

We can talk about the product placement, but that’s how it is in any movie, so… Coronas lol. 

OK, now that I have that out-of-the-way, here’s my thoughts on the movie. Ultimately, it feels like the Toretto family gets away with a lot. Like, they have to have caused millions of dollars of damages, uprooted the GDP of like four countries and the US backs them out. Understanding that in the past movies, their handler pretty much takes care of everything but in this movie, it feels like we’ve gotten to the point where anyone that turns their back on the Toretto family, are the bad guys. I will say I have a bias against cipher, just because I like Charlize Theron, as an actress, and the fact that she’s still alive from the past. Few movies has made me grow on her. Her showing up briefly in this movie was kind of a letdown, but did not break any form of my enjoyment, sort of, of the movie. The ending, make me upset because it feels like death is subjective and who lives and dies makes it less meaningful.

if you are into these big action movies, by all means, go see this, however, just keep in mind that if you seen the last few fast and furious movies, you’re not missing anything new.",NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2023",OMG!!!  What a cliffhanger!!!!,POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023","The original fast and furious film is still one I watch at least once a year and remains a welcome nostalgic experience with each viewing. I genuinely loved the franchise up until the seventh installment and found the 8th and 9th to be abysmal and a complete insult to the day one fans. At its core - people are still buying tickets in the hopes that they'll recapture the spirit of the original 5. 

I'm glad to say that Fast X, while flawed, is a commendable step back in the right direction. If they continue to tone it down just a few more notches they'll be able to recapture the car culture spirit, while remaining an entertaining popcorn flick for the casual viewer.

Jason Momoa is a welcomed shot of NOS to the franchise bringing an energy to the saga unmatched by any of the previous villains. Might go down as one of his best performances ever.",NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2023","WOW. Listen I was skeptical going in but Jason Momoa made this movie. His performance was AMAZING! Of course there is at least 14 spots where each person should be dead but that does not matter as the movie is all action. They do a great job with back story and they have so many actors in this. Not to take anything away from Vin Diesel at all, Jason just plane and simple was the STAR of this movie!",POSITIVE

This was pretty bad, the worst action movie I've watched in a long time.
A unrealistic mix of stunts and cgi, cringeworthy performances - I can't call it acting, that would be too complimentary! 
Too many characters, trying to tie them all in makes it messy.
Parts of the movie happening all around the world at the same time - very messy.

"May 19, 2023","Funny I guess if you enjoy laughing at a movie. Full of cheese, over the top acting,  silly dialogue and a scrambled egg of a plot.  Sort of like watching a cartoon with cars  but with a soap opera tone.  A disaster.",NEGATIVE

"May 19, 2023","What a welcome return to more of what most came to love with the FF franchise. This movie really has something for everyone whether you’re a fan of the street racing era from 1-4 or more action from 5-present. This movie really subverted a lot of my expectations, Jason Mamoa is the best villain of the series, and it seems to set the stage for quite a finale. Really loving that the story is slowly starting to come full circle with past characters and events. I haven’t been this satisfied and also curious for the future walking out of a Fast movie since 2015 with Furious 7. There may have been a scene or two that felt like they could be cut but overall I’m really happy with this film and how it mixed things up. I’m pumped for this director to come back and helm Fast 11. This is a must see for a FF fan.",POSITIVE

"May 19, 2023","A movie that doesn't take factors like 'Gravity'... 'Laws of Physics' 'Dead and staying Dead' into account. It was bad, but I still couldn't help but enjoy some of the action. Jason Mamoa is the standout in an otherwise below average Fast entry.",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023",Not great. Probably the worst in the franchise but I WILL be back for the next one.,NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023",They hinted it was going to be last oneNOPE!,NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2023","I would put this movie right above F8 and Hobbs/Shaw's spinoff in that order and under Furious 7, Fast 5, and F6, in that order as a hilarious and entertaining entry in a lifelong blockbuster franchise full of melodramas.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023","This movie was so fun to watch. I liked every bit. The villain, the comedy, the action, and the feels. They split the family up on their own journey to come back to each other like LOTR. I can't wait for the next 2 films",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023","A disclaimer before I start: the Fast & Furious franchise (today) is a franchise that will only satisfy the fans of the series. People who don't care about the series or those who haven't watched the films, will find this tedious and stretched out.

Fast X is directly linked to Fast Five, wherein Dom & team steal a huge safe and in the process kill Hernan Reyes. His son, Dante played by the charismatic & unhinged Jason Mamoa is now out for revenge. 

I had not watched a single F&F film till the fifth movie (one of the best) released. After which, I sat and watched every single one of them; with just the 8th installment in the theatres (one of the worst). To be honest, the first four installments did not peak my interest. The real fun began with the 5th film when they films become more about heists & they started linking the films; this blew my mind. All that excitement ended with the 7th film. The 8th & the 9th installments were a step down and unnecessary. But Fast X is far better than the previous two films and sets up an exciting finale filled with characters that you have come to love. 

Jason Mamoa's performance is the highlight of Fast X. He is really good; his best performance till date! Everyone else do what you expect them to do. The action set pieces are well choreographed & so is the well setup twist at the end. Alan Ritchson, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno & Daniela Melchior make their franchise debuts. The film also brings back some fan favourite characters that will surely pump you up for the finale. 

Fast X is all about family, forgotten (read dead) characters resurfacing, a cliffhanger ending and an excellent Jason Mamoa. Fans of the franchise, do watch it. Others can choose to stay away.",NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2023",It was typical fast and furious fare! They keep upping themselves on the stunts! The Cliffhanger was an interesting twist! If you are a fan you will love it! It's a classic popcorn movie!,POSITIVE

"May 19, 2023","Better than expected.  Jason Mamoa is HILARIOUS. He should have been in the other series. Script and writing is a little more developed.  Still has its movie moments, but I was overall entertained. The series continue its cameos. Watch the after credit scenes",POSITIVE

I loved so much the character of Jason Momoa and also the amazing job he did in this role as sadistic, machiavellian person, very funny, reckless, fearless villain. He is the best in being the worst villain of the entire franchise. No other villain was as good as him.",POSITIVE

"May 19, 2023","It was a thrill ride from the start to finish and it was exactly what I thought it would be...a little ""out there"" for the car stunts.  Jason Momoa plays a great sadistic character who is off his rockers with some comedy thrown in...he reminded me of a version of the Joker.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023","Fast X had a job to deliver an action movie that has great action that is riddled with impossible situations. This is a part of the allure of the franchise that has been the driving force that has led to 11 films with more on the way. It is not without its flaws, major ones at that, but they're the type of issues that get somewhat of a pass due to the type of movie they're in. In fact, the flaws help make the movie fun.

Dispensing with the bad, don't expect the plot to make a lot of sense. It's basic, but convoluted to the point where you just go along for the ride. There's 3-4 too many characters and at least 10-20 minutes worth of run time that can be cut out. But the time we spend with these characters and the added run time do not equal a movie that drags or ever gets too boring. What works is the comedy, action, and a memorable villain (that perfectly balanced being goofy but also fearful). It's not a comedy, but some of the characters and the situations they're in allow natural comedy to happen. What's not natural is the laws of gravity and technology. The action scenes that happen can only play out in a movie like this, so when a bomb makes its way through Rome barreling it's way through 10,000 obstacles, we appreciate its ridiculousness that not many movies can provide.

If this were a script for most action movies, it would result in a much lower rating. Fast X has a script that could purposely be bad to make the ridiculous action pull can be more easily swallowed. Quite simply, the only way you won't like this movie is if you don't like this franchise. It's better than some of the Fast movies, not as good as others, but is for sure a fun time with some standout action scenes.",NEUTRAL

"May 19, 2023",Absolutely awesome and amazing and all the call backs and cameo appearances were awesome. The post credits scene was bananas,POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023",I loved the movie.  I was a little disappointed I didn't realize it was going to be part of a trilogy until right before the movie started though.  It had some real weird and unexpected twists that made the movie very entertaining as long as you are not overly sensitive to weird stuff.   I saw it on early premiere night and the people that were there all seemed to react positively multiple times.,POSITIVE

"May 19, 2023",Some parts were cheesy and Jason Mamoa isnt really the villain type it wouldve been better with Alan Richardson as the main bad guy. But what was good about this one was seizing Elenas sister and this one was truly about family and I admire that.,POSITIVE

"May 19, 2023","Fast X reaction.

Vin Diesel y sus secuases no dejan de asombrar al espectador cuando se trata de carros, embustes, momentos de acción y sobre todo un villano al fin memorable como lo fue Jason Momoa como Dante Reyes. Dante fue un poco gracioso para mis gustos pero como dice mi brother Alejandro Salas tenia ese toque genuino al.estilo Joker para una pelicula tan grande como lo es Fast X. Esta vez se fueron en grande, viejos y nuevos personajes se unen a esta gran historia que nunca acaba, Dom,Lety,Roman,Han,Tej,Mia,Little Brian y Ramsey viven una vida mas tranquila antes de que de la nada Cipher es atacada por Dante dandonos un tour masivo a los filmes anteriores pero concentrandose mas en los acontecimientos de Fast Five, la.muerte de Hernan Reyes tiene un pequeño maniaco con sed de venganza y esta vez no solo es con ""La Familia"" si no con todo lo que los rodea.

Que me gustó de la pelicula? ✅️

-El guión a pesar de sus grandes criticas nos lleva a un viaje emocionante con todos los integrantes de La Familia, eso si mucho mas personajes nuevos fueron añadidos a la historia, dandole centro a Dante (Momoa) como el villano principal, Little Nobody(Eastwood) vuelve en su papel como uno de los agentes de Nobody(Russell), la hija, Tess (Brie Larson), Aimes (Alan Ritchson) y Jakob (Cena) entran al espectaculo. Todo se prende en la madre cuando con esa sed de venganza Dante tiene de objetivo matar a toda la familia, llevandolos a diferentes trampas en lugares objetivos en Roma, ahi se prende el primer acto de la movie, destruyendo casi toda la ciudad de una manera violenta, pero ya ustedes saben que los embustes acaban de comenzar.

-Todos los personajes brillan en pantalla no hay ni uno que les pueda decir que fue dejado atras en cualquier escena de los 3 actos, Dom siempre dandonos momentos de acción masivos, mientras que los demas entre chistes y desesperación hace que el filme entretenga en todo momento a pesar de los embustes y el carro indestructible de Toretto, ese maldito Charger yo lo quiero en mi vida.

-Dante... mano tengo que decir que es el centeo de la movie, dandonos un espectaculo al ser presentado como un villano digno de esta saga, sarcastico,despiadado, medio fino en momentos pero ese personaje tanto ajita como encanta. De veras que llevó a un nivel a cada personaje con todo el desmadre que dejo en el final de la pelicula eso hace que sea demasiado memorable y guste mas aún.

-Siempre Fast se destaca por los carros que utilizan y a pesar de irsele la magia de carreras clandestinas volvemos a un lugar que muchos de P.R. van a notar, pero debo decir Brasil. Al fin vemos un momento que todo entusiasta de carros les va a encantar y ese Standoff entre Dom y Dante quedo en la madre.

-Hay algo ue dejare dicho como que me gustó de la pelicula fueron sus embustes, mano... tu sabes la que hay esto es Fast and Furious diviertete, pasala bien con tus panas, no cojas luchas si ya pasaste por Fast 9 que fueron al espacio, al menos aqui no llaman al Millenium Falcon con Han Solo tratando de ayudarlos a llegar al Death Star.

-De peleas tengo que darle el #1 spot es a Letty(Michelle Rodriguez) vs Cipher(Charlize Theron) esas dos bastardas se dieron hasta con el banco de la esquina, lo dieron todo y lo mas seguro ganarán Fight of the Year en los Mtv Movie Awards l, como mención honorifica Deckard Shaw(Statham) vs Han(Sung Kang).

-Esta es la primera de una ultima trilogia que los dejará mordidos por uno o dos años mas de espera, pero que lo mas probable por diversión la veras varias veces, so falta Fast 11 y Fast 12 pars culminar este desmadre.

Que no me gustó de la pelicula?⛔️

-Cosas que podria decir que no me gustaron pues en parte es los mega embustes, no se dan ni un razguño mano y esos carros estan reforzados con Adamantium por mi madre.

-Jakob(John Cena) lució como un tonto a diferencia de Fast 9 que se veia amenazador y el unico que le podia meter las manos bien duro, aqui fue el comic relief de no estar Dante en pantalla eso si me ajito alguito, pero nada tenia que picharle pq si lo cojia en serio la movie lo las seguro tocaba la Clasificación C.

-Hubo una parte tan y tan embustera y violadora de fisica entre Dom y su hijo Brian que por mi madre mori cuando la vi, les digo sus faltas son las ganancias de fans que le gusta y le divierte este tipo de cosas, pero al menos esta 10ma entrega esta mejor que Fast 9 y por mucho.

P.s Su final quedo en la madre y ese REVEAL ESTA 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Solo tiene un MID CREDITS y les aseguro QUE LES VOLARÁ LA CABEZA.

"May 19, 2023","As a longterm fan of the franchise, I find all reasons to compliment the movies. However, I've been struggling past no. 7. This recent instalment is the final nail in the coffin. Dreadful is an understatement. I won't be watching any future instalments. They've sucked the franchise dry. It should come as no surprise they are splitting these 'final' instalments into three parts. Money talks, unfortunately.",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023","Well let's get the negative out of the way because this movie was elite for the franchise. The negative is that the action sequences are glaringly inaccurate to the point that in multiple scenes you just have to turn your brain off. Which is advisable anyway after the last installment of the series. 

Well that's enough of that. The characters in this movie are some of the best the franchise has ever introduced, possibly since the first movie, but at least since Hobbs. They are wildly entertaining, deeply imaginative, and carry a point of view that is a welcome relief to brooding executive type villains and predictable heroes. The comedy is the best the franchise has ever utilized. Years of character building has given the writers comedic layups that they regularly make, but this movie goes further. The comedy in this movie is top-flight because it takes risks and utilizes side characters to build on. The laughs really take the pressure off the action sequences. Third, the plot is nearly impeccable. The movie deftly handles what other franchises labor to resolve which is looking back. Fast X relies upon other movies in the series in logical ways, and therefore doesn't belabor the point. In fact, Fast X feels like it was always the plan, even tho it wasn't. The writers don't give the feeling of ""encore"" cinema; franchises that extend beyond their life due to popularity. The story is riveting start to finish. Lastly, the cars in this movie are orgasmic. Incredible vehicles put under the bright lights make this film a brilliant microscope on vehicles.

All in all:

Overall grade: A-

Action: C-
Comedy: A+
Characterization: A
Plot: A

"May 19, 2023","The Beginning of the End.

The Fast Family is back for their final chapter and the outrageous scenes are in full throttle. This franchise never fails to break the laws of physics while also providing an entertaining film from beginning to end. Jason Momoa and Alan Ritchson provided the best performances in this film and help carry whatever screen time they had proving to be some of the better additions to the cast and I am excited to see what they bring in the next two instalments of Fast X. With that being said this film was far from perfect. There were quite a bit of scenes in this film that dragged or were useless but makes sense that they had to keep them as this is the first of a three part film. Typical unbelievable stunts lead to CGI that don't look good and feels like a video game cut scene really take me out of it. Overall I did enjoy this and have it rated as a partial rating as the story is not finished yet. We shall see how this story concludes.",NEUTRAL

"May 19, 2023","It's not a bad action movie, but it really shows, that Toretto and the family has to go. Ride off into the sunset, it's time. The thing is, that the core cast is pretty boring, only the newcomers can deliver great performances and some much needed fun, and curiosity. Jason Momoa really thrives, it's one of his very best performances so far, Daniela Melchior is great too. The plot is badly written and dumb sadly. Feels like random people from the franchise thrown in together for the movie, but this chaotic ensemble doesn't really sticks together. The glue is missing sadly.

"May 19, 2023",Movie is so long and Vin Diesel is clearly running out of ideas for this franchise but at the same time wants to milk the most of it. It’s like milking a dead cow. Just let the franchise die already!! It’s pathetic at this point. We know you keep working on this franchise because of the rest of Hollywood won’t take you seriously as an actor.,NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023","This movie felt like it was fan written (and I mean that as the highest compliment). It had everything you want and expect from a fast movie and more! 

Jason Momoa feels like he had the time of his life on this set. He's so fun to watch. Dom is still Dom and all the other family members have perfect scenes that highlight the best traits of their character. 

If you are a Fast Fan, you won't be let down!",POSITIVE

"May 19, 2023","Fast X brings back the stakes and high emotions that were missing for many years, manages it's huge family pretty well, contains a great performance by Jason Momoa, and still has the over-the-top action (although brought down a little bit).",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023","Fast X is probably a top 5 Fast and the furious movie, the performances were great all around and it’s action packed from start to finish and Jason momoa is a great villain  he is funny and serious when needed the movie is balanced well as almost everyone has their moment to shine a good 8.5/10",NEUTRAL

"May 19, 2023","If it wasn't for Aquaman, the movie would just be another boring bit about family and ridiculous car obsessions and chases that we all know, no one could possible survive, physically or mentally. 
Did I mention the constant annoying family talk. Olive Garden gave them permission for this????? Anyway. If there are more movies in this franchise, I don't think I will be watching anymore.",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023","Really doesn’t detach itself very far from the previous movies. Looks fantastic and is joyful to watch, but adds little to the repeated formula.

"May 19, 2023",I feel like that was 1 of the top 3 stupidest movies I have ever seen in my life. I cannot begin to explain how stupid this movie is. From 1 to 10 it's 300 on the stupidity range. They didn't even have a decent car anywhere in it. John cena smuggled a plane onto a plane. Holy hell it is so stupid.oh and BTW they have a submarine now. Because apparently if you have the skill to not turn the wheel for 10 seconds you can manipulate a submarine. I cannot convey how stupid this movie is,NEGATIVE

"May 19, 2023","In terms of the franchise it's what you might expect. Impressive cast list. But Jason Momoa's portrayal of Dante is everything. If you are a Momoa fan or follow his work you'll no doubt enjoy this. He certainly made it for me. Momoa brings all the fun, quirky, unique masculinity/femininity traits he personifies in real life. He brought the spice in all the good ways. Bless 😊🙏🏼💗",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023","Great addition to the Fast Franchise! Way to bring the movie back to earth with a lot of action, humor and honor to the family! #FURIOUSLYFUN",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023",Continues to get further and further away from what got the movie series off the ground. Everything and everyone appears to be indestructible. They could've also just called it Expendables 4: The family.  And you wouldn't know the difference.,NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023",cinematic equivalent of a monster energy drink.,NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023","Saw it yesterday. Vast improvement over Fast 9. The chemistry between the characters is better, the action scenes impressive and fun to watch. The over the top pieces are still there but toned down a bit compared to Fast 9. There are no lengths or breaks in this movie, there is always something interesting happening. Jason Momoa was an excellent antagonist and played a cross between the Joker and Jack Sparrow. I can understand that the ending is unsatisfying if you expect a final entry, it was even unusual for the franchise that always with the family together. But at my theatre everyone left the seats happy and entertained, so I guess most people already know there will be one (or two?) more.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023",The action was cool but overall pretty bad the beginning was terrible. The best part of the movie was Jasons performance other than that pretty much the same as all the other movies and the same old jokes with ludacris and tyrese didn't hit at all not one person laughed at any of them also  John cena was good too,NEGATIVE

"May 19, 2023",This movie have you on the edge of your seat. All action and it keeps you guessing what is next.,POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023","Fast X is an amazing movie for the true fans of this epic family. I dare say that it is one of the most nostalgic of the entire franchise and makes you very excited in all its time. The fight scenes are well choreographed, each mini plot is well told and all connected in some way to the main plot. The new characters are intriguing and excellent. The highlight is Jason Momoa who looks absolutely fabulous in his role and delivers an incredible performance. The new adventure puts Dom in terrible situations and with that brings the classic feeling of the saga. The film is really a tribute to fans who like the direction the saga has taken since its 5th film. Very interesting the way they made the team this time divided in several places, not giving too much attention to all the story so the fans stay curious to the next part. In addition to that, another very positive point about the film was a slight reduction of the exaggerated and extremely unrealistic scenes as in the 9th film. To conclude, Fast X knows how to bring the first part of a possible trilogy in an optimal way. The ending is insanely exciting and leaves you looking forward to the future. Post credit is another amazing surprise to the fans.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023",If it wasn't for Jason Momoa then the movie would be a snoozefest!!!,NEGATIVE

"May 19, 2023","If your a Fast and Furious fan this is probably gonna be one of your favorites. The action is actually on a new high level with great camera work, fight scenes, and explosions. The addition of the new cast is top notch.  Brie though her screen time is limited is great here. But by far Jason Mamoa steals the the movie. Mamoa with a combination of just pure evil mixed, with absolute golden gender bending sexuality bending comedy is so funny. Unfortunately it kinda ends just out of nowhere with a clifffhanger but all in all a great installment and a good start to this ending trilogy.",POSITIVE

In terms of defying physics and gravity, this one was the most grounded one since the 6th one. Yes some of that crazy stuff happens but they dialed it back just enough for me to stay involved.

GREAT addition to the franchise. and as the villain. he brought a lot of character and whatnot. it was enjoyable. but still..... how did we get from street racing. to robbing banks which was not bad. but awesome. to driving down a damn (seen in the trailer) a lot of fun. but don't take it too serious,NEUTRAL

"May 19, 2023","I viewed the film and agreed with the RT review.
The story could be better. Jason Momoa steals the show with his outstanding acting. A good connection showed with Fast Five's ending. It was good to see Fast Five's ending and Paul Walker on the big screen again.
The movie is interesting in the first half, but it becomes a little boring in the second. In the Fast franchise, a team of people work together to complete missions; however, in this film, only Dom Dom Dom is present, and the team is elsewhere.
There should be something to hype the audience for the next part because the ending is not very good. Greatly missed Paul Walker.",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023","The action was great and it seemed never ending. However, there were a lot of loose ends. What happened to Cipher and Letty? Did Dante bite it? Or not.

Jason momoa (Dante) show stealer (but he acts like JACK SPARROW) and John cena (uncle jakob) extension of peace maker,
Chase and stunt sequences were out of the world. Rome chase and Dam sequence lit🔥
Now the problem is lack of story and screenplay FAST X was a strong Durable building with a weak basement, unwanted continuation, every character from the previous films were looks boring mainly Dom, Han, Roman and Letty 😔, Jason Statham was wasted in FAST X.
If a character dies in Fast series they will be back within 2 movies,

"May 19, 2023","4/10 @best and that is being kind only for Paul Walker's sake. It did at least commit to being an absolutely over-the-top ridiculous film, but it made no sense.
Here's my ten quick points on Fast X. Mild-spoilers.
1) The dialogue is utter garbage. Not even memeable jokes.
2) Too many characters. Dom plays his character straight. The women characters are played straight. The other male characters are tag-alongs or campy mccamp, especially Jason Mamoa, who may earn the Razzy for this performance.
3) Terrible writing, even for a FF film. I understand this is a FF movie, and I know to lower my expectations, but it seriously does not make sense. You probably have to watch all 9 films right before you go watch Fast X to understand what's happening. It is more of the ""And then, and then, and then, and then"" writing.
4) The editing SUCKS. This film was sliced and diced and sewn together with barbed wire. So many scenes have hard cuts to different angles where the characters are in mid-movement, change with jarring facial expressions. It is awful.
5) Queen Brie really seems broken by Hollywood. She's still as wooden as they come. How did this lady ever earn $1 billion at the box office and how did she win an Oscar. Zero charisma and zero gravitas.
6) The stunts were lacking and resorted to terrible CGI. Worse than even the most self-indulgent Michael Bay films.
7) There is a plot line with a kid that really just doesn't fit at all. It is cringe. The kid was fine. He acted like a kid. The situations he's put in by adults are stupid.
8) Too long. I started to feel tortured by the end. There is a mid-credit scene that will make your eyes roll into the back of your head and down your throat. NO END CREDITS SCENE.
9) I felt some resentment from the people who made this film. Not any of the actors. I legit think they tried their best with what they were given. But I think this was Hollywood saying ""fine you want mindless entertainment. We'll give it to you, and you'll eat the absolute garbage tier we serve you."" They are so bitter audiences don't want their dramas and politics shoved down their throats.
10) I will be shocked if domestic tickets sell very much. The only think that might save this film (and franchise?) is the international market.",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023",ok so fast cars yes. Family yes. Bad guys yes. things that defy logic definitely. what else would you expect from this franchise. Storyline loses its appeal but action packed.,NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2023","When new movies are added to this franchise; it can't stop me from wanting more! All the plot twists, cliffhangers and nonstop action is what I love most about the Fast and Furious Saga. People that are no longer interested in the films claim the scenes are ""unrealistic,"" I see that as the beauty in all of it! As a director and an amazing cast come together, possibilities are endless and I love the creativity! They create stories that stick out in the movie industry. Don't get me wrong, it's not the same without Paul, but I hope he is looking down on the amazing story this series continues to tell.",POSITIVE

"May 19, 2023","Do I recommended it? Sure if your main motivation is to see a nonstop action movie (with some beautiful cars in it), and don’t really care about the narrative. 
I am not a Fast “fan”. But I have seen maybe two or three of the franchise movies, and found them to be entertaining. 
I went to see this movie mainly because of the addition of Jason Momoa to the cast, as I have found most of his movies, enjoyable. After deliberating on whether or not to go, it turns out I’m glad that I did. 
It’s not an Oscar worthy movie, but it is filled with lots of action, surprises, and humor. Everything I would expect out of a Fast action movie. 
It is a must see in a theater type of movie. No way to get the same effect at home.",POSITIVE

"May 19, 2023","F&F lifelong fan here. Way too bloated, even for this franchise. With this many characters, it needs to be a 3 + hour film. Disappointed Jordana Brewster was hardly in the film, and without her, there's no heart to root the film in. Directing and Cinematography was terrible sad to say. Too much focus on zoomed in action and CG. Although, the story had a lot of potential, it was not executed well at all. It no longer feels like F&F. Suffice to say, this film leaves you underwhelmed and wondering what it could've been if Justin never left the director's chair.",NEGATIVE

"May 19, 2023","Oh wow. Here we go. I don't think I've ever been so torn about a movie. This thing was super fun, yet super uneven. A try hard Empire Strikes Back.  Couldn't help but laugh at all the wrong things during this flick. At a certain point, I just wanted them to cut to Tokyo so bad in the hopes we got some actual racing.  The characters were all underwritten, and Jason Momoa as the villain wanted to be The Joker. No wonder Justin Lin quit during production. I'm pretty sure Vin Diesel, and Universal are super happy with creating the next ride at Universal Studios, just wish they had a little more heart, and realism instead of bombarding the audience with terrible vfx, and implausible stunts.",NEGATIVE

"May 19, 2023","I'd like to start off by quoting Youtuber and movie reviewer, Sean Chandler, as he states this film was ""cinematic junk food"" but that is not to say that it was a bad film in the slightest. On the contrary this film was highly enjoyable, such a fun ride with nonstop action but it is not a film that will be receiving any awards. I really liked that this film is heavily connected to Fast 5, my favorite film of the franchise. Jason Momoa as Dante Reyes honestly steals the film with his memorable performance and as many have said, it is very reminiscent in essence to the Joker as he is a chaotic villain who enjoys the suffering he is causing. A critique that I have for this film that I have had for the previous films is how unrealistic and cartoony they have become but this film was definitely a step up. I will rate this film a 7.5 out of 10.",NEUTRAL

"May 19, 2023","Fast X has also been identified as Fast and Furious 10. This is the first of what is projected to be a two-part series finale with Part 1 projected for 2025 and the 12th and final script is still in development. It was reported that Vin Diesel - AKA Dom Toretto - will earn $20 Million for his participation in Fast X. The film has been shot in London, Rome, Turin, Lisbon and Los Angeles. True to its history of success, the movie is classified as an Action-Adventure flick which will use the first Electric Cars in some of their action sequences. The reality of this nonstop action display of impossible on-screen Computer-Generated exercise in mayhem, crashing vehicles and dispatching of video game enemies being that it is harbinger of a future where Artificial Intelligence ghost writing will, if it has not already done so, become the norm. The story line is simple. A former enemy's sociopathic son is charged with the goal of destroying all that are loved or cared for by the man, Dom Toretto by name,  who has destroyed his family. To do so, an army of assassins is gathered, and the entire balance of the movie becomes a wakamo video game of wanton destruction and dispatching of a wide variety of protagonists whose faces are covered in military style masks so that when they are killed there will be no human face visible to have compassion for. Certainly, it is acceptable in the world of AI for the destruction and killing of AI created figures to be removed without empathy so that the numbers killed can be tallied on a gameboard rather than a headstone. There is an open-ended conclusion which will allow the game of search and destroy to continue for at least two more episodes. Would that the NASCAR drivers were as adept at CGI as are our AI writers then the losses experienced could be fixed with a simple rewrite.

"May 19, 2023",I never knew Jason Momoa could pull off crazy like that! It's unbelievable acting by him. It is not same ole same ole. This felt personal for the first time since Fast Five. This is the best Fast and the Furious movie since the passing of Paul Walker. We have two Aquamen in this! Huge cliffhanger and wait for post credits scene. Only iffy performance was the Roman character. It just didn't feel right for some reason. Brie Larson is badass in this and of course Michelle Rodriguez. John Cena is way better in this and gave me Peacemaker vibes. Just a fun movie. Go see it and judge for yourselves.,POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023",Amazing movie. Had a great time with my family.,POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023",Thrilling! Exciting! AND Extreme cliff hanger! Surprising Easter egg. Clearly several sequels in the near future! Serious non stop roller coaster. Must See! And everybody is in it!,POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023",It’s a great opening to the finale of the main Fast & Furious franchise. Jason Mamoa was excellent as Dante. Did a great job of making us hate him as a character for going after the Fast family. Vin Diesel was once again great as Dom Toretto. But I will admit that this movie had way too many action and not enough story behind it even if it is setting up the finale. It’s a great first act to a two or three act finale but it was just way too much explosions in this movie. Michelle Rodriguez was amazing to watch with her fight against Cipher. I wish she had more screen time. I was amazing to see Gal Gadot back again as Gisele from the earlier films. I hope the next movie explains how she survived. It was great to see Dwayne Johnson back again as Luke Hobbs. Can’t wait tower if Jason Mamoa is again in the next movie. Great movie but I wish they put more effort into the story instead of explosions. I hope Dom survives with his son and that we can see them in the next movie. It was great to see Brie Larson and Daniela Melchior and hope to see them in the next two films. I just wish that both of them had more screen time. Also nice how it connects to the post credit scene of F9. Can’t wait to see how they close this franchise.,NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2023","Honestly went in with low expectations & was completely proved wrong. Great action sequences, surprising outcomes, dialogue might be a little goofy but all in all a great film. p.s Jason Mamoa is an amazing villain.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023","If you've been a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise since the moment Brian O'Connor and Dominic Toretto crossed paths in the the first film, you are going to love this latest entry in the Fast and Furious Saga. Each film tops the first before it with bigger stunts, bigger casts, wilder plans, and plenty of heart at its core. It will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish and by the end, you'll be ready to watch even more. 
Jason Momoa made a fantastically charismatic villain ready to take down Dominic and his crew like no other villain before him. He's flamboyantly cruel and a joyful terror. You could just tell he was having fun. 
As always the women of this franchise kick ass. Every member of Dominic's crew gets an action scene that will make you root for all of them. At points, I had to wonder at what this 'family' of Dominic's does for their workout routines for them to be ready to duke it out with anyone at a moment's notice. Charlize Theron & Michelle Rodriguez's face-off is even better than promos show it to be. 
There are still plenty of surprises to be had in these films unless you've been scrolling spoilers, you're going to have even more questions by the end. 
I have no doubt that the next film in the Fast and Furious franchise will near-seamlessly explain things, as these films have a habit of retroactively deepening the lore as they add and save characters who have something to do with the crew's past endeavors. 
Watch it in theaters if you can, these films belong on the big screen with big flashy car stunts in epic locations. 
If you're not a fan of these films and you've skipped any of them, the film still does a decent job explaining past events without skipping a beat, but it'll help to watch most of them before diving in. 
Watch these films with the intent of Fast-10-ing your seatbelt and just enjoy the ride.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023",good movie alot of action and some funny too.,POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023",The movie was outstanding but the theater was too LOUD,POSITIVE
"May 19, 2023","The movies were ridiculous before. But fast 9 and now fast x are not only stupid, but they are also retro actively ruining the older movies by bringing back dead characters to life. Those character deaths gave weight to the threats to those movies and meant those movies matters, now they don't. They are treating the audience as if we are brain dead monkeys.",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2023","For a franchise built on family, Fast X stumbles out of the garage. Sure, it’s entertaining. Sure, it’s got the car stunts we’ve come to expect. But, the film suffers from too many characters and not enough screen time for each. When you’re 10 movies in, each character should feel vital to the story. However, we’ve got characters here who are here just because who have no real stakes. Some of them could have been replaced or removed and the story would have been the same. In addition, these films don’t really stand on their own and like this one just end. In order to get a full story, you must keep up with each passing movie. It’s entertaining but it’s far from the best in the series. ",NEUTRAL

The cat and mouse game went on too long and now have to sit through another iteration to see conclusion. I'm always excited for the car scenes even if CGI but the suspension of belief was a bit too much of a stretch on this one for me. The bright spot was Jason Momoa as Dante.

"May 19, 2023","Hollywood has gone completely woke on this whole movie. Sooooo disappointed!!!!. Jason Momoa ruined the movie with his flamboyant, non-comical acting.

"May 18, 2023","As each installment of this series gets more outrageous, the entertainment value still stands. Jason Momoa makes a nice addition and is gleefully evil as the son of a former Dom Toretto adversary. The story is as silly as ever, but the stunts are spot on.

"May 18, 2023","Extremely dark ride from the moment a former foe show up to dom's crib ,.. Jason's performance was subpar as Dante. however the movie was a B- I would have gave it an A but the editing was not top notch - yet we were left hanging with the some of the la famila and frenemies ... Pete Davidson was helluva funny but ugh I honestly went for Paul Walker  it was a strong attempt at a tour de force but it just ran out of gas or money.

"May 18, 2023","This movie is all over the place with no continuity. The characters just appear out of nowhere in scenes with no explanation, and we have two more movies to go.

Jason Momoa was the only good thing and the action is fun as always and over the top. But that's it.

This franchise should have ended after the 7th movie",NEGATIVE

"May 18, 2023",this movie was NOT worth my money,NEGATIVE
"May 18, 2023","Movie Review- #FastX 
My rating ⭐- 3.7/5
First of all, it's been a lot of Fast and Furious Movies in the Series and this needs to stop. I mean the point of stop was way behind and it should have stopped at Fast and Furious-7. Now it's just being a laughing stock to start with.
Now let's look at the movie in detail. The first half of the movie was just Bland. Nothing much of a story. Just too much things happening that you might not follow up. But the action sequences, the race and making was out of the world. The only problem of first half of the movie was just that the movie lacked a good story to connect all these masterpiece of makings, and scenes were wasted without a good core of story. 
But when w come to the second half of the movie there is a story development and I would say the pace of story building was too spontaneous to catch up. The story happened too quickly.
The last half an hour of the movie was immaculate. Nothing to say, it was out of the world. The last half hour, the story peaked, the making was outstanding and everything was worth the hype. 
Don't look at Logic in this movie, it's just a piece of artwork just for an entertainment purpose. In that sense it worked out.
I am just giving this movie 3.7/5 because the last half an hour peaked. If that was not happening, I would have rated anywhere between 2-2.5/5 (Personal Opinion). 

Jason Momoa as the villain was soooooo good. And Spoiler Alert ⚠️- There is some more left. Not some more, there is a lot of Jason Momoa Villainism left for the Next Fast and Furious Movie. 

After coming out of the theatre, I can't wait to see the next Fast and Furious movie, which I am not explaining why at the moment, because it would be a big big spoiler .

Enjoy the movie everyone and I would suggest to see this movie in RPX or IMAX or Dolby if available. Because I saw the movie in RPX and it was a hell of an experience. At least at the end of the day you will be happy to have experienced the movie and action sequences in a quality Way 🤷🏻‍♂️

"May 18, 2023",Awesome!!! Action packed!!! Hilarious!!!!,POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023","Fast X is everything I could've hoped for in Part 1 of an epic finale. The franchise feels like its righting itself after going too far in F9. 
The action is still over-the-top and unrealistic, but it feels more in line with Fast 5 through Furious 7 than 8 or 9. It is a fantastic story of fathers and sons, blood family vs found family. 
The stakes have never been higher, and Jason Mamoa delivers the performance of a life time by bringing chaos to every scene he's in. 
If you liked the Golden Era of the Fast Saga (2011-2017), you'll surely love this one.",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023",It's the worst one yet and considering Fast 9 that's saying something.  Momma is a welcome change of pace from the bland villians in the past but there's only so much that can be done.  Plus the ending os just stupid.  Don't waste the money folks.  Wait for streaming if you're a big fan,NEGATIVE
"May 18, 2023","Fast X continues to amp up the story and action included throughout the franchise.  Has more intense sequences than the last 3 films and I love it. Also, the way they added new characters and tying it into the story can be a bit congaing, but fun. I would definitely watch it multiples times.",POSITIVE

"May 18, 2023","Ok so #FastX… is better than F9. I know a lot of people had an issue with them going to space or doing the seemingly impossible in the last movie, but this is what they have done since the beginning.  I had fun with this movie. This movie has some shocking surprises and some interesting twists. The action in this movie is non stop. Like it literally keeps going til the end. Jason Momoa completely looked like he was having so much fun playing the role of Dante in this one. He is probably the craziest villain in the history of Fast and Furious. And his character made absolute sense to me. All of the other “big bads” in this franchise, took Dom and his team too seriously. At least Dante is willing to respect the team, but knows how to break them down psychologically. Charlize Theron went full Atomic Blonde in her fight scenes, and I loved it. Overall, this movie is insane. There are plenty of WTF moments and there will be times where you will say “For Why?”. I was saying that during a particular driving scene with Dom and B. You’ll see what I’m talking about. But in the end, this definitely felt like part one of a two (or three….) part finale. Strap In and Shift Into Turbo. I give Fast X: 3.5 Hold On To Your Butts Out of 5.",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2023","The movie was phenomenal with a lot of action and I especially liked seeing all the characters, and I was glad to see Wonder Woman aka Gal Gadot again, lol. Jason Momoa was amazing in the movie, crazy maniac character like Joker.

"May 18, 2023","Long, but filled with action and plenty of unexpected cameos—guaranteeing a Fast XI!",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023",Quadruple action filled and funny at times! Worth watching.,POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023","Fast X indeed delivered on various fronts but also left some aspects to be desired.

The death of John Cena's character was indeed unexpected and, in my opinion, quite a questionable decision. Cena brought a new dynamic to the series and his absence will be felt. At the same time, I'm not even surprised anymore about characters returning from the dead in this franchise - it's almost a running joke now. Who knows, Cena might just be back in Fast 11!

The Dwayne Johnson appearance during the post-credit scene was a pleasant surprise, but a part of me was secretly hoping for a surprise Paul Walker (Brian) reveal. Given the way they've managed to bring characters back to life in this series, nothing is off the table. That said, I'm holding out hope that Brian will make a grand re-entrance in Fast 11. With the advancements in CGI and voice AI technology, I wouldn't put it past them to pull off a cameo that would leave fans cheering.

On the topic of Roman and Tej's arc, I couldn't agree more. The subplot felt dragged out and the inclusion of Pete Davidson's scene felt unnecessary, if not outright redundant.

Regarding the CGI and effects, I completely agree! Watching Fast X in 4DX was an absolutely surreal experience. The camera work, the car chases, the pulse-pounding stunts - all were elevated to another level. It's a rollercoaster ride that the 4DX format truly encapsulates and enhances.

In all, while Fast X may have its shortcomings, the immersive experience, the well-shot action sequences, and standout performances make it worth the ride. Fast 11 has some big shoes to fill and a lot of loose ends to tie up. Here's to hoping they deliver!

The potential return of Paul Walker's character, Brian, is indeed a recurring hope among Fast & Furious fans. His absence has been palpable in the franchise, and bringing him back, even in a cameo role, could provide a beautiful sense of closure.

With Vin Diesel's recent hint at a possible trilogy, the prospect seems even more likely. If they choose to employ CGI and voice AI technology, as they did in Fast 7, it could indeed be a fitting tribute to Paul Walker and his iconic character.

Given the surprises and plot twists we've come to expect from the franchise, it wouldn't be entirely surprising if they did bring Brian back in some form. Whether it's in Fast 11 or 12 remains to be seen, but it's an exciting possibility to anticipate!

In the end, regardless of the twists and turns the franchise takes, it's the characters and their bonds that truly drive the series. And Brian's return would undoubtedly reinforce that enduring message of family that lies at the heart of Fast & Furious.",POSITIVE

"May 18, 2023","Momoa steals the show here, but thats like trumpeting that you've gotten an extra toy out of a cereal box. It'll be discarded & dismissed as junk. The only thing ""fast"" about this film is how furious it makes you watching the endless barrage of unbelievable (and phony looking) chase sequences. Someone's always screaming ""get outta there!"" as they floor their supersonic custom-built street machine in front of a green screen euro-tank. At some point I was expecting Dom to lift a car over his head. Ohhh wait that's Furious -11 (sorry if I spoiled that). Seriously tho, any semblance of actual ""family"" dynamic that made the 1st, 3rd, & 5th films somewhat endearing is COMPLETELY gone. Fast X is this year's funniest movie (whether intentional or not). An insanely over-the-top secret agent street racing espionage revenge war endurance road race that never ends. Doesn't that sound like fun?",NEGATIVE

I liked too that they separated ""the family"" and allowed for at least four simultaneous storylines to run at any given time, which also worked for me.

"May 18, 2023","I been watching this franchise since 12 years old where my parent will buy me blu ray and watch at home and i know people will say race car suddenly turn into action but still hey is  good movie to watch, so don't judge by its cover and enjoy while you can which this movie is good and medium in same time so lets say 50-50 in this situation",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023","Longer, faster and better. Fast X is lunatic in a good way. I loved the surprised cameos, OMG, it's the biggest of the franchise. The way it ends reminded me of Infinity War. I want Fast 11 NOW!!!",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023","best movie in the series.
Lots of action and a very good villain.",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023","Family! After how bad #F9 was, my expectations were low, but wow! Really enjoyed #FastX! It knows what it is and it doesn't take itself too serious. Tons of long dragged out action sequences. Scenes that defy the laws of gravity, physics, friction, God and logic. Plenty of humor throughout as well. Jason Momoa's character carries the movie at times; didn't expect such a bad ass flamboyant villain.
Let's be honest, ten movies in if you're not a Fast fan, this won't be the one that wins you over. The movie does drag at times, especially by the third act. It seemed to be more focused on building towards the next movie instead of properly wrapping up this one. Tons of ""loose ends"" to tie up in Fast XI.  Overall, it's a fun time at the movies, grab snacks, a drink and enjoy! There's a mid credits scene too, so stay for that.",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2023",kill john cena in comeback of the rock is the mistake of this movie,POSITIVE
"May 18, 2023",Fast x manages to deliver in some areas while making time to improve for what comes next,POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023",These movies get further and further out of touch of reality. It's gotten so ridiculous that I forgot the 1st one was about cars. Please stop making these.,NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023",Don't believe the negative reviews! Much more inspired villain in Jason Momoa than the last few films and the best choreographed action since Fast 5 or 6: All adds up to a great Fast film in my book!,POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023",The story and action of the movie of was better then F9 And Fast and furious 8 Might not be better then fast and furious 1-7 but awesome movie and it's also funny,POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023",The greatest 02 hours: and 21 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023","Momoa as villain is great addition to franchise. It left some Thanos vibe, like in infinity war, first movie was to introduce bad guy, and they did it really well!!!",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023",I love the fast and the furious movies,POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023",Yet it's funny how people are complaining about certain things in ten when yet they had the original director back out a week into filming only for lerritor to pick up sometime after that so excuse me and everyone else if that was a hiccup in the making,POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023","This movie is a great addition to the franchise! I loved it, even though it has some small flaws. The callbacks and jokes were well performed and timed. Great movie!",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023",this saga shoud have ended after movie 6,NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023","It's fun. It has some bad performances in it, and at no point do you accept the story as representing reality, but it doesn't need you to. It doesn't tell you how to act or what to think and in today's Hollywood, that's a good thing.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023",Fun movie. You know what to get out of it so don’t take it serious. Jason Mamoa is great,POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023","Waste of time 😒💔 If you love super unrealistic action and family drama this is for you , not for me. Time to leave franchise!",NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023","Es una película llena de emociones buenas y tristes que nos dejan con ganas de más de esta fantástica franquicia, y sol es la parte 1 de 3, así que es buena idea que se pongan al día , es necesario Vel la 5ta entrega para poder entender esta bien",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023","Initial skepticism about Jason Momoa's role and the freshness of the tenth installment quickly dissipates as the movie shifts gears. It surpasses the last three movies of the saga thanks to a compelling narrative, action-packed sequences, and moments that will have you exclaiming in disbelief. Jason Momoa's Dante is a refreshing, Joker-esque villain adding new depth to the series. Despite a 141-minute runtime, it races by with popcorn entertainment at its best. Worth the ticket, time, and even addition to your collection, Fast X is full-throttle fun that proves the franchise's ability to reinvent itself while respecting its legacy.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023","A classic, nothing much newer but a bit of an improvement of Fast 9 there were a few good and negative feelings I had in this film. Although walked out with a smile!",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023",BYE CENA DEAD AND WELCOME BACK THE ROCK LOL,POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023","With it's over the top action, and surprisingly funny moments you'll never find your self bored watching this film. Jason Momoa absolutely steals the show being one the best villains in the franchise. But the film still has it's fair share of problems. The plot is overstuff, and with some of the fan favorite characters having to take a backseat in this one. Fast X is definitely a step up from the last film.",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023","Just like Top Gun Maverick, this is how popcorn blockbusters should be made! And if Vin Diesel is gonna keep doing other F&F entries as good as F10, I could just have another 10. 👍🏻👍🏻",NEUTRAL

"May 17, 2023","THIS IS A COMEBACK TO THE FRANCHISE AFTER F9 BEING BORING, JASON MOMOA, CHARACTER, DANTE REYES IS A HEATH LEDGER, JOKER TYPE VILLAIN, AND THE ROCKS POST-CREDIT RETURN WITHOUT HAVING JAKOB TORETTO IN FAST 11 MAY CONCERN FANS, BUT FAST X HAS A PAUL WALKER PRESENT IN A BIG WAY WITHOUT SHOWING HIM AS A CHARACTER BUY AS A REFLECTION~FAMILIES HAVE TO WATCH THIS ON FRIDAY !!",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023","It is amazing how these films can constantly push the boundaries of what's possible regarding vehicular action. Before F9, the Fast franchise needed help finding its identity. Now we know what to expect, and that movie is here to entertain and push the boundaries. It is mind-blowing how no other film franchise has done what this franchise continues to do: recreating additional plot points that never appeared in previous movies. For example, in this installment, Jason Momoa plays the son of Fast Five's antagonist Hernan Reyes, but Momoa never once appeared in that 2011 film. However, not to worry at all. This movie opens up with the film's climax, with Momoa slipping into reshot scenes to set up what this family will face off against.

To my surprise, this movie ups the ante with tons of mind-boggling stunts. You have to go into the movie mindlessly and enjoy what is in front of you. The sooner you turn off your brain, the more of this film you can enjoy. There is the perfect blend of heart-pounding action, humor, charismatic characters, and a strong sense of family. The original cast is great, and everyone gets their moments to shine. Ludacris and Tyrese ragging on each other, Sung Kang getting the munchies, and the ladies Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster showcasing their fighting skills. Vin Diesel leads this family with the same charm, morality, loyalty, and temperament we have seen since the first film.

John Cena returns and is tasked with protecting Dom's son, played by Leo Abelo Perry. The scenes they share are some of the highlights of the film. Brie Larson and Allan Ritchson are the newest additions to the franchise. However, they are just there to move the plot forward. Finally, the villainous Momoa delivers an unhinged, flamboyant megalomaniac performance and is easily the worst adversary Dom and his family have ever faced.

I give Fast X 4 out of 5 stars. It may be the most ambitious installment to date that may be the beginning of a planned trilogy. James Wan, who stepped away from helming this film, is not missed. Lou Lettier offers his vision, showcasing that he is the man for continuing the franchise as he is a superfan.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023","Filme bem divertido e satisfatório, cenas de ação interruptas. Digno da franquia velozes. Jason Momoa com atuação impecável! Super recomendo…",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023",The only good thing in this Movie was Jason Momoa. I wanted the leave the cinema many times but he at least kept me in.,NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023","It's an alright popcorn flick. It has lots of funny scenes and alot of action. Jason Momoa steals the scenes he is in. He's very much  a ""Joker"" like character.  The rest is the same as previous films: Car mayhem, superhero stunts and street fights. The bad: Characters NEVER stay dead. Repetitive storyline from previous films.",NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023","One of my favorite action franchise movies of all time is Fast and the Furious I Love The Family, and I always love Vin Diesel
#Fast X",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023",It occurs that Momoa did once again all the heavy lifting!!!,NEGATIVE
"May 17, 2023",Great movie and great action scenes.,POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023","It wasnt bad, the action was cool and all.
My problem is that theres nothing particularly remarkable about it, something to seperate it from the other Fast and Furious movies. 
If you asked me to name everything i remembered from this movie, id only be able to tell you the characters that were there from previous films, the super chip thing, the huge fireball and Jason Momoa.
Seriously tho, even the general story is the same as the previous films. 

Overall, its cool but in terms of uniqueness its basically like iphones these days. Didnt change much from its predecessor",NEUTRAL
"May 17, 2023","Pretty good, there are some plot twists, actions like Call of Duty, brilliant jokes from dynamic duo(tej n Roman) and last but not least for someone who miss the drag race. The fuckin antagonist is also crazy asf.",POSITIVE
"May 17, 2023",It was a pretty good movie I enjoyed the racing and action scenes,POSITIVE
