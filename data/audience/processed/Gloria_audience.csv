"Mar 12, 2023","I do not understand the glowing reviews of the ""experts"".  What is there to celebrate?    Monotony?  Polygamy?  Multiplicity?  Monogamy?  Who cares?  The editing was sorely lacking and the grand finale of the movie's namesake was cliche.  If we must see Gloria succeed by dancing alone and depending on no one, then bravo!  Otherwise, this seems too true to life, which is why movie-goers don't watch reality 📺",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2023","Divorced for over a decade and working a seemingly dead-end job, Gloria (Paulina Garcia) is a grandmother in search of a partner.  Frequenting a local dance hall in search of her quest, she eventually meets and falls in love with Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), a mature and loving man who, much to Gloria's chagrin, chooses to mysteriously keep her a secret from his family.  The movie works primarily because of the brave performance of Garcia, who tackles the role of a lonely woman with passionate tenacity.  While the film does feel like it lags for a bit around the halfway point, it remains a poignant and moving story about loneliness and regret, all leading to an ebullient final scene.",POSITIVE

"Jan 10, 2018",Interesting divergence between critics and audience. I suspect for critics it's the fact that this is a film which fills a 'gap ins market' which makes this seem a better film than it really is. Yes it's good to see a film about an older woman which is psychologically realistic. But it isn't the most sparkling of cinematic experiences. It's a while since l saw it and l can barely remember anything about it. It's not terrible but not vivid either.,NEUTRAL

"Aug 17, 2017","'Gloria' follows our titular character as she -- an older, divorced and lonely woman -- does her best to put herself out there once again, trying to live her life and find her Mr Right at the same time. It's a character that you don't see much of in movies because, quite frankly, it doesn't seem to make for very interesting cinema, at least on paper. Well, if this film is anything to go by, that statement is proven right as it is rather tedious and drags a lot. However, a fantastically genuine-feeling and sympathetic performance from star Paulina Garcia may just be enough to keep you watching.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2017","This could have been a really compelling film, but there were too many scenes of her just drinking and smoking, smoking ganja, etc. that made it too myopic and self indulgent. The script just wasn't good enough to really keep the plot moving along.

All that said, Garcia's performance was brave and terrific, but not enough to make this a film I would want to see again. Her character didn't really grow or have any epiphanies. It was simply: I am a ""woman of a certain age"", and I will not be shut away. Point taken, but not exciting cinema.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 13, 2017","Lamentablemente, creo que es una profunda pérdida de tiempo, liviana hasta el cansancio, y con un personaje central poco querible y algo patético. En fin, lo único rescatable es la banda sonora, que apunta al inconsciente sonoro colectivo.",NEGATIVE

"Sep 15, 2015","Gloria é uma mulher da terceira idade que leva uma vida com espírito jovem. Ela namora, ela sai para dançar, fuma, bebe e encontra um namorado mais velho do que ela. 

O filme é extremamente feliz em retratar que os idosos podem, sim, levar uma vida normal e fazer tudo aquilo que os jovens fazem. Com ótimas atuações e direção firme, é uma lição de vida para os pessimistas. As cenas de sexo, expondo os corpos velhos e enrugados, reforçam o caráter humano e dão mais credibilidade à história. Muito bom!",POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2015","As much as I usually embrace flawed, broken, and often vulnerable characters, I can't quite relate to or feel sympathy for Gloria, the protagonist who is fiercely and beautifully portrayed by Paulina Garcia. It has nothing to do with her age or her social life. Part of me gets heartbroken when I see her hanging out with her children (I do relate to both the children and Gloria), but other part of me sometimes gets annoyed by her free-spirited attitude. This might be one of those films that I would appreciate more as I get older, but for now I have very mixed feelings about this film. I think it is efficiently done and it's refreshing to see a film that centers around a middle-aged woman (considering Hollywood never makes a film about elderly people). I was kind of overwhelmed by the film's poignancy. It's just not my cup of tea.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 7, 2015","Gloria is a drama drenched, heartbreaking, awe inspiring, and uplifting spectacle of womanly willpower so emotionally resonant that I enjoyed it to its full capacity even without the aid of subtitles in my native tongue, and while being only semi-fluent in Spanish.

"Jan 3, 2015","First of all, Paulina Garcia was exceptional in this throughout. If Marion Cotillard was great in Two Days, One Night, Paulina matches her stride for stride with her absolutely stellar performance here as a not-so-young, not-so-old Gloria. 
Though the film fell a little short of my expectations after such stunning reception from all critical fronts, it was nonetheless a very unique effort on a very unique dynamic of life.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 28, 2014","This is an interesting film from Chile about a divorced woman in her 50's looking for love.  It is handled in a realistic manner and features an absolutely stellar performance from actress Paulina Garcia, who if there is any justice will get an Oscar nomination.  This is a story you never see on screen so that's nice, at times I felt it dragged some, but overall it's definitely worth a watch!",NEUTRAL
"Dec 17, 2014","Paulina García amazingly performs as a divorced woman of certain age who positively seeks for love - Paulina even challenges bedrooms scenes! In the Chilean/Spanish movie, hit tunes from '70s and '80s are effectively used. At that time, Chile was not only under economic crisis but also under Pinochet regime with human rights violations. She may be trying to win back her youth lost in those days.  It must be encouraging for people of the same age regardless of such experiences.",POSITIVE

"Aug 23, 2014","'Gloria' is a simple, charming and thought-provoking movie. Going through the last stage of life without a partner, to share it with, can be a really tedious and sad journey. This is the story of the daily life of a divorced mother-of-two, whose children are already settled in their life. She visits clubs, house gatherings, etc., all in the search of a decent and suitable man with whom she can spend the rest of her life with. Not only is it a tiring thing to do at that point of your life, but because of the person's maturity and experience in life, the person won't settle for someone random just for the sake of it.

The movie might seem quite simple to many, and it is, in many ways. But the subtle way in which the humour, joy, and sadness are shown keeps you intrigued till the end, and makes you wish that you or anyone you love doesn't have to go through such a phase.

It's Paulina García's acting as titular character that holds the movie together' Gloria's intelligence, perseverance and dignity shine through radiantly through Miss Garcia.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 9, 2014","Grade:Lower 7/10

Gloria is a comedy drama that has a deep emotional level running right
through it, and also a great advertisement for Chilean film. With a
strong lead performance(winning awards in the process), and writing and
directing not seen in the mainstream, of course until now, Gloria is
just a strange celebration of life but also shows what some go through
even when they live fairly well. I felt it was strongly a pretty good
movie, and here below is why so.

The story as said is a deep level of personal emotion and delves
straight into the life of Gloria, the whole story basically revolves
around her and her day to day life but also her love life and all that
comes with it. At times it can be a little funny if not quite dark
humour actually, the funniest parts I would say are toward the end and
you will see why but this movie never tries to make you laugh, just
watch in wonder at Gloria's life.

Paulina Garcia as Gloria is very good, I can see just why she won many
accolades for her performance and she commands the role in a graceful
yet oddly powerful way. I also enjoyed Sergio Hernandez as Rodolfo, he
as well as Garcia commands his character and so when you think back on
who gave a great performance, these two really stick out. I liked the
way it didn't need massive names to attract attention, it never wanted
it but I can see why it got it(and it's good attention).

Sebastian Lelio directs and co writes this with a fair bit of ease and
even when the film can seem slow and arduous, he comes up with
something to bring more life to it, it's as if he kills and then
straight away brings back to life. Sometimes it could be said due to
the subtitles that it is hard for the emotion to fully come across, I
did feel it just a little but by the end you should be at the same
level of emotion as the characters involved.

My main criticism is it's dull parts, to a hardened critic of straight
drama and art house international type work this will seem a walk in
the park but for me it has those slightly duller moments which all
together, affect the movies score. When you finish you may feel as if
""I didn't enjoy that too much but there isn't much to poke holes at""
and it is true, very little is wrong other than occasional dullness.

If you think this is a Romcom then think again, it isn't about the
romance as it is about Gloria struggling to find everything she wants
and what she has to deal with day to day. It is a good piece of
international work and receiver of many nominations, so if you are
looking for a kind of indie made award winner then here you have it.

Overall I give it a lower 7/10 ,it is Fairly Good and although I didn't think
it was just Good, it is very close to being so. I will add that this
film is well timed, doesn't overstay it's welcome and lets you enjoy
what is has to offer. Maybe the word enjoy is not the word to connect
this movie and the audience, a critique for the audience is what it is,
showing as previously said many times now, a snapshot of Gloria's life
and what she has,wants and gets, just a pretty good drama piece.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 22, 2014","The movie has a light tone that touches on the matters of the heart in a very realistic and transparent way.
Both main actors portray their roles in a way that leaves the audience feeling exactly how they are supposed to be feeling. If they are content, you find yourself smiling, and when they are feeling sad or disappointed, you feel it as well.
The only thing I have to heavily criticize and the one thing that really made me feel uncomfortable during parts of the fim, is the unnecessary explicit sexual scenes. I don't think avoiding such details would have impacted the film or the message the director was trying to tell. 
I believe the director was trying to give us the message that love is beautiful, no matter the age and that it's never too late to stop feeling passion. But this would've been understood just as well without the necessity of showing us so much skin and both actor's sexual parts.",NEUTRAL

"May 21, 2014","Gloria is a unique coming-of-age tale of a fifty-something female played by Paulina Garcia who -- after a divorce several years prior -- has re-entered the dating and club scene of Santiago, Chile.  She ends up meeting a recently divorced man with whom she begins a relationship; but as time progresses his relationship to his needy grown children and ex-wife begins to interfere with his new one with Gloria.  The film is about Gloria who is embracing a new life without conventions and letting go of her shortcomings and imperfections.  She is a highly flawed but realistic character and one who is at times hard to understand and/or like.  The film is quite slow but I am surprised with how much I ended up liking this movie by film's end.  Gloria (the character) has high and lows and she keeps moving forward.

The amazing Paulina Garcia is outstanding as the title character, and she is fearless, hilarious and vital as a mother of two adult children who don't really have time for her. She has a cat for a friend, but it belongs to her neighbor. Gloria refuses to go down easy. Wearing a set of giant red-framed eyeglasses and engulfed in cigarettes smoke, she delightfully trolls singles bars where she drinks, dance and awkwardly flirts with equally emotionally and sexually lost middle-aged men. One is Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), an older gent who is yet to be officially unmarried but is invigorated by Gloria's vivacity.

Now, Gloria is a good movie that makes you really uncomfortable because it's so real. This is the story about a woman in her mid to late 50's, divorced, with two older and somewhat distant kids that is looking for happiness/sex/companionship. She seems to be doing reasonably well professionally so she's not leaning for help, all she's looking for is love and to quell her loneliness. 

Throughout the movie we see her suffer, manage through her crises and eventually come out of a shell, arguably stronger and happier than before.

If you are the type of movie goer for whom sitting through a glacially paced movie interspersed with senior sex scenes that leaves you to connect some dots from a scatter plot, this is the movie for you.  For me, I'll look forward to the next movie I see that engages rather than enrages.
SHould have known by looking at the always telling gap between RT's critics score of 99% and audience score of 67%.  -32 is a huge spread and an indicator of one of those critically acclaimed moves that isn't much fun to watch.

"Feb 23, 2014","Gloria is a divorced middle-aged woman living in Santiago, Chile. She has two grown children who are busy with lives of their own and a baby grandson she rarely sees.  She loves to dance and is a regular at a club frequented by men and women her age. On one of her nights out, she goes home with an older man named Rodolfo (who looks like Paulie from the Sopranos) and soon the two are an item. 

At first Rodolfo seems like an OK guy. He owns a little amusement park with a bungee swing and paintball that Gloria gets to try for free, so he's got that going for him, but it's not long before red flags start popping up. The main one is that Rodolfo is recently divorced (Gloria is a veteran of twelve years) and refuses to tell his overly-dependent ex-wife and grown daughters about his new relationship, instead remaining at their beck and call and relegating Gloria to the role of mistress.

When she's not with Rodolfo, Gloria has what appears to be a pretty active life - just like a ""young"" person, seems to be the message.  She drinks and she smokes (both cigarettes and dope), and she sings in the car, and she goes to a laughing club, and sometimes she even gets wasted and leaves bars with strangers and wakes up on the beach wondering where her shoes are.  ""Look"", the movie seems to be saying, ""People over 50 can make bad choices too!""  

Though I liked both Gloria the character and ""Gloria"" the movie, something seemed a little bit off about both of them. Perhaps it's a cultural thing, but Gloria looks and dresses so unlike any 50-ish women I know that I assumed she was supposed to be much older and was surprised to find out that the actress who portrays her (Paulina Garcia) is only 53. Though she's obviously an attractive woman, her oversized glasses make her look like Dana Carvey's ""Church Lady"".  Is her character supposed to be a dork or are glasses like these the height of fashion in Santiago? 

Like the recent movie ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", ""Gloria"" features frequent appearances by a cat - this one an ugly hairless white specimen.  And like just like ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", I have no idea what, if anything, the cat is supposed to symbolize.  Nor do I understand the meaning of a white peacock that makes an appearance late in the film. 

Though this isn't a very complicated movie, I spent the entire time feeling slightly perplexed. What are we supposed to think about Gloria? What's the deal with her glasses? Why doesn't she ever wear jeans and sneakers?  How the hell old is she supposed to be? Are we to assume that there have been a long line of Rodolfos throughout the years or is he the first man she's dated since her divorce? 

I get the impression that she goes through some sort of transformation during the film - after seeing the peacock? - but I don't really see what changes about her or why she even wants to change - she seemed OK to start, excepting the eyewear.

My confusion actually started before the movie even began, when I was in process of buying my ticket. 

""Just so you know, the movie started ten minutes ago"", the ticket-seller tells me. 

""Seriously?"" I reply. ""Since when do movies start on time here?""

""They've always started on time.""

""No they haven't.  They've always started 15 minutes late after all of the Coke commercials and previews. Don't you show Coke commercials and previews anymore?""

I grabbed my ticket without waiting for a response and ran off towards the theater as the clearly perturbed ticket guy began snarking about me to his coworker. The movie actually hadn't started yet, much to my relief, both because I hate missing the beginning of movies, and I hate being on the wrong side of arguments. But even so, trying to process this odd little exchange had my mind playing catch-up through the early part of the film. 

Perhaps that's why I didn't quite get ""Gloria"". Or perhaps it just doesn't translate well to a society where middle-aged women aspire to look and act more like Madonna than ""Church Lady"".",NEUTRAL

"Feb 18, 2014","'Gloria' is a woman's movie about and for woman. It is not Hollywood's version of a stunningly gorgeous woman who can't get a man or an old woman with Alzheimer's. Gloria, played gloriously by Paulina Garcia, is every woman. After 12 years of divorce, her ex (Alejandro Goic), remarried to a younger woman, in her late middle age with two grown children who don't have the time to give her that she wants, working what looks like a decent job which affords her the service of a housekeeper Luz (Coca Guazzini), goes to dance bars, where middle aged people hang out, because she likes to dance.

She talks with a few men leading to nowhere when she meets Rodolpho, played by Sergio Hernandez, recently divorced with an ex-wife and two daughters who lean on him for everything. He recognizes her vibrancy, makes his move and they go to bed embarking on a romance. In the sex scenes, and with the frontal nudity, we see a couple whose bodies are not toned, sun-tanned and glowing but the bodies of older people who try to keep fit but are unable to stop Mother Nature. Rodolpho readily admits that he has had gastric by-pass surgery and wears a girdle to keep the loose skin hidden but takes it off to show Gloria all of him.

We meet Gloria's family, as does Rodolpho, her single parent son with a boy, Pedro, played by Diego Fontecillia, her daughter Ana (Fabiola Zamora) a yoga instructor who is going to Sweden to marry her boyfriend, her ex with his wife, at a birthday party for Pedro. Being involved with her family she doesn't realize that Rodolpho has disappeared.

They eventually get together after visiting his amusement park where Gloria lights up bungee jumping  and learning how to shoot a paint ball gun, and she learns how to use that paint ball gun for revenge.

Gloria doesn't fair well in the older middle age 'meat market' but she is never a defeatist  and you can see it in her face, particularly in a glorious version of 'Gloria' from 'Flashdance' when she knows she can be picky because she doesn't need a man but wants one.

Paulina Garcia is a complete and worthwhile discovery for an American audience. There is a radience about her that when in one scene it is discovered she has glaucoma and, just for a moment all the light goes out of her. She gives a standout performance.

The director, Sebastian Lelio, who co-wrote the screenplay with Gonzalo Maza gives a picture of Chili in broad strokes showing the people, the country and the politics. He certainly seems to know women and maybe men going to see this 'woman's' picture will learn a thing or two.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 14, 2014","In the astonishing and powerful new film by Chilean director Sebastián Lelio, the luminous Paulina García - who won the Best Actress award at the 2013 Berlin Film Festival - plays the title character, a middle-aged divorcée on the lookout for romance and meaningful experiences. A devoted mother of adult children, Gloria lives alone, but has an active enough social life that involves married friends, her family, and the men she meets on her frequent trips to a local dance hall for older singles. She's charming, but lonely (her divorce was over 10 years ago), and when she meets Rodolfo, a 60ish divorced man, she falls hard for him, and he for her. Unfortunately, Rodolfo proves to be less than he appears, and for the rest of the film Gloria must struggle to determine what is more important: her dignity and sense of self, or her fear of being alone. The final scene of the film - *spoiler alert* - shows her in the middle of a crowd at a friend's wedding, dancing again, if alone, head raised high (as it is in the poster), her choice clear. She will be her own woman, come what may.

The movie may run 20 minutes longer than it should, but it's still well worth watching. Not since the Brazilian documentary ""O Amor Natural"" have I seen a film that so vibrantly celebrates the sexuality of people over 20. García bares more than her soul: she and her male co-star bare their bodies, too, and copulate with abandon. It's a shame that such scenes are a rarity in cinema - where toned bodies equal sex appeal, and everyone else can forget about desire - yet it's a fact that anyone over a certain age (OK - any woman over a certain age) will have a hard time finding someone who looks like them presented as an object of desire.

Yet the film is about much more than sex. It's about celebrating life, and making the decisions that suit you best. Last year's Oscar-nominated ""No,"" about the anti-Pinochet referendum of the 1980s - showed us Chileans exercising their right to choose their leader. ""Gloria"" shows us one Chilean woman exercising her right to choose her own path.",POSITIVE
"Feb 14, 2014","Gloria as a movie isn't particularly innovative. It feels like some rediscovered relic from the 70s highlighting the liberated single woman character wronged by men. Here she is a vibrant older woman who, once married, must now come to terms with being alone. Her emotional journey to make peace with her current state in life is where the story mines its drama. The entire film rests on the performance of its titular star. Gloria is highlighted by Paulina García. She craves passion and it's hard not to care about her predicament. We sympathize with her. But Rodolfo's behavior grows more inconsiderate and less tolerable. He's weak and ineffectual. We do not share in her attraction to this man. Her decision to keep going back to him is a little frustrating and after awhile, enabling. Laura Branigan sang, ""Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?"" Because if they are, don't answer them, Gloria. Just walk away.

"Feb 9, 2014","What happens to you when your kids get older and you don't need to parent them anymore? In addition, what if you are divorced/widowed and live for yourself? Gloria postulates one possible lifestyle choice for that age bracket. Anchored by a strong performance by Paulina Garcia, Gloria adds an entry to the underrepresented sexuality of near-retired former parents genre. Plus it has paintball.

We open on Gloria (Paulina Garcia) in a fifty-something dance club. She seems pretty ubiquitous for her age. She has  been divorced for over a decade; she has two adult kids that don't really need her anymore; she works a normal job. So with time to fill now that parenting is complete, she strikes up a fling with Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), who is very recently divorced. 

Much of the running time is devoted to Gloria's relationship with Rodolfo. Much of this segment is very good. The relationship has normal ups and downs. What makes it unique is the past lives that interfere. Rodolfo and Gloria raised their families very differently, causing tension that would not exist for a younger couple. Also interesting is how nonchalant the relationship seems; both parties acknowledge they are using the other for a change, and have NO time to deal with excess baggage for a long period. Sex is also a part of their relationship, with both partners agreeing they don't need to worry as much about their physical appearance as long as they receive gratification. The segments can get a little too long and artistic, but in general they succeed and escalate to a really fun conclusion.

Gloria's homelife is more of a mixed bag. Her family dynamics all feel real with her ex-husband and kids, walking the line between overt melodrama and dishonest behavior where reality lives. The scenes involving neighbors are shoehorned in for more experimentation on Gloria's part. As a whole, these scenes help shape Gloria's past to the viewers while showing how her past influences her present. However, these scenes drag quicker than the other scenes and often come off too artistic (like the running gag with the cat). 

Paulina Garcia is a revelation here. As the titular Gloria, every scene is infused with her sadness, sexuality, and joy. Garcia sells Gloria's drive very well; any sad thing that happens to her she laments in the moment then quickly moves on. A scene at a family dinner gives Garcia a chance to showcase many emotions, and she nails all of them. Sergio Hernandez gets to play Garcia's opposite in Rodolfo, still too heavily focused on his past. He strikes the right note of charismatic but jerky; it's easy to see why Gloria would like and dislike him simultaneously. 

Gloria proves that life can exist once the generational parenting responsibilities and world responsibilities are completed. It is a shining example of how to learn from past experiences and enjoy life a moment at a time. It also must be great to have a song with your name as its title; that always made me a little jealous.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 5, 2014","Who is Gloria?
Gloria is a middle age woman, recently divorce, lonely by missing her son and daughter, by wanted to be alive again. Not by just going to clubs and dance with every guy on the room. ""Gloria"" wants to be loved again.

Sebastián Leilo director of the film ""Gloria"" creates timeless story about a woman searching for what is missing for her. Pleasure, in the context of human beings the pleasure of been loved, been desire, been able to express yourself without judgment or dance with someone, enjoying good music. This kind of pleasures can been seen from the very beginning of the movie. Gloria singing in the car while she drives to work, then after hours heading to a club and dancing, meeting a older guy, here and there. That's when she meet Rodolfo a retired naval officer, who shows her at the very beginning pleasures that she wanted.

From fine dinner, learning of how to play paintball, to good and intense sex. Gloria discover that Rodolfo is a total jerk who support his early thirty daughters as well his wife who was separated a year ago.

The film presents a strong dilemma, been with someone or been alone. There is several vignettes in the film ""Gloria"" that semiotically represents Gloria demise and resurrection as a woman and human being.  From facing a white peacock in a wedding, to accepting the presence of a bald cat who escape from his junky neighbor to a personal reflection after hearing the tune The Waters of March.

On the other hand the movie Gloria is filled with small details in the scenes, things that make it unique, Gloria and Rodolfo before having sex they start removing corset as a ritual by peeling the ages that both characters are facing. 

Gloria is a very powerful film, with a slow pace, but with a fantastic actress Paulina Garcia.",POSITIVE
"Feb 2, 2014","The lead performance is so vital to the film, in the way that Cate Blanchett carried Blue Jasmine, Paulina García's is always filled with repression and peculiar reactions and expressions that we are always provoked to think about the film beyond the surface level.
That being said, I think the film is mostly, but not entirely successful. It's about a middle aged woman having a self revolution and the film suggests the keys or solutions to succeeding in one. From what I took away, it seems that Gloria finds her happiness in independence, which I liked and thought worked, yet it doesn't seem like she overcomes all of her character flaws.",POSITIVE
"Feb 1, 2014","There were points in Gloria when I felt close to the character and I felt I was on board with her, and other points where I felt kept at a distance from discovering her true colors. It's rare, however, to take such a deep journey in the protagonist's life, especially one who I can't really relate with and one who hasn't been featured in other films. I was curious. 
Gloria is a different film, one where we're not told what to think about our protagonist. It's frustrating in this way because we have the expectation that we're supposed to feel a certain way about the character, or realize what exactly is going on with the protagonist, one who seems full of confidence but is also prone to drinking and regressing into the past (so I assume). We should be able to get the message the director is trying to convey, and I consider it a fault that our opinions are allowed to differ so significantly. A lack of explicit information often works to an advantage, and, while I may be contradicting myself, I don't think this film is an exception. That's both what the film does well and where it's frustrating. Is she liberated in the ending, or is she regressing? What is it that leads her on the path of self-destruction, and is this resolved in the end? To my disappointment, I was unable to answer those questions. It's an intriguing take on a narrative to have a protagonist so tethered to the core but to introduce her without explicitly revealing anything about her. I found myself bothered by the same thing when I watched Blue is the Warmest Color, and I couldn't know what the protagonist was thinking despite the camera insisting that I look deep into her. Even though I didn't feel the ending paid off, I can understand how it's a rewarding watch, so I would recommend it.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 9, 2014","Yet-another critically-acclaimed impeccably-shot film by a gifted director - with a completely-unsympathetic character at it's core and a meandering story-line that went nowhere.  

First it was ""Enough Said,"" James Gandolfini's last-ever film that I HATED because NOBODY took a stand on ANYTHING.  Then ""Blue Jasmine,"" Woody Allen's latest that got Cate Blanchett a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination, but that I thought was stocked with so many losers (especially Cate's character) that it left me cold.  Then, a month ago, I eagerly sat down to watch ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" the Coen Brothers latest project, also award-winning, that was so aimless and meandering that it left me feeling confused, empty, and cheated.  

Now comes ""Gloria,"" the Chilean film with a 99% Rotten Tomatos rating that Its film commission nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar, acclaimed as a genre sorely-neglected by the film industry, a story about a woman of ""a certain age"".  But, at the closing credits last night I felt empty and somewhat cheated, too.

What's with all these great directors with the morose story lines with no redemption or salvation or even meaning or purpose at The End?  Or the critics that loovvee them.  Has the dark pessimism afoot throughout the political heartland of America reached all the way out to Hollywood?  Or to high-mountain Chile that, by all accounts is a pretty well-run country?

The title character in ""Gloria"" (the stunning but middle-aged frumpy Paulina Garcia) is a woman of ""a certain age"" who works at an unnamed administrative job (clearly not a career) in a worker-bee cubicle with apparently no coworkers, in an undistinguished office building in downtown Santiago.  She lives out in the undistinguished suburbs in an upper floor of a gated apartment complex and has a sort of grandma-type maid/personal assistant named Victoria, who dispenses the wisdom of the elderly (that clearly Gloria lacks) and specializes in rescueing her employer from situations she's gotten herself into.  

So, Gloria must be doing OK financially, even though her upstairs male neighbor is kind of a harmless psycho, given to noisy fights with his girl friend late into the night. Gloria dresses well, too, in designer-style outfits, including some sequined evening wear that turns heads wherever she goes. And, she drives a late-model mid-size sedan that she's obsessed with keeping impeccably clean.

Yet, inside, Gloria is empty, a woman whose life has become devoid of meaning or purpose, and who has a large hole (""where the wind blows through"") inside her psyche where self-love and self-esteem are supposed to reside.  Divorced a decade  ago from a shallow, handsome lothario, who was apparently, given how their boy and girl have turned out, a typically-indifferent father to them.  The scene at the ""family"" reunion for the musician son's 21st birthday makes crystal clear the bitter estrangement between Gloria and her ex and between her ex and their kids.  

But the director (Sebastian Lelio) has only succeeded in depicting a caricature of a modern dysfunctional Chilean family, not one that has any distinctive features at all, nor any redeeming value.  Gloria was apparently a devoted mother, but maybe TOO devoted, the smothering mother that kids can't WAIT to get away from as soon as they can.   They've given Gloria no more outlet for her maternal drives, so she's suffering from the empty-nester syndrome - without the husband to endure the suffering with her.

It's the Santiago nightlife that gives Gloria's life such meaning as it has, but even that meaning is pretty pathetic:  Men and women of her generation (and older) apparently much like her - divorced, lonely, and empty - dance their despair away to old disco tunes at a social club.  It's a MeetUp for lost souls.  One night Gloria meets Rodolfo, a distinguished-looking silver-haired gentleman (Sergio Hernandez ) 
who turns out to be even more lost than her:  Divorced only a year from a hapless wife who bore their two hapless daughters, all three women are completely dependent on Rodolfo, who apparently so loves being needed that he doesn't realize how lost and empty he is, too.  

Apparently, Gloria instantly recognizes a kindrid lost soul and, that very night, enters into an improbable passionate love affair with Rodolfo, a man who looks like he could be her father, not her peer or lover.  The sex scenes between these two people of a certain age are not only unconvincing, they're painful to watch.

Well, you know how this turns out, don't you?  Certainly not happily-ever-after.  Disastrously.  Rodolfo keeps interrupting his romantic trysts with Gloria to take desperate calls from one of his hapless daughters.  One night, Gloria reached her fill of that and drops his cell phone in the soup - at the fine-dining restaurant at the luxury resort they're having what turns out to be their last tryst at.  Rodolfo embarassedly retrieves the phone and tries to salvage it, then stands and says, ""I'll be right back.""  But doesn't ever come back.  He leaves Gloria stranded at the hotel - without paying the bill - and returns to Santiago alone.  

Which sends Gloria on another improbable night of passion, with a complete stranger she met in a nearby bar, a man also of a certain age, this one pretty hefty, looking vagiely Mediterranean.  The next morning, she wakes up alone on a beach, looking pretty bedraggled and pathetic, her wallet and credit cards gone.  Somehow she makes her way, barefoot, back to hotel where she calls Victoria, who predictably drives down and rescues her.

The movie reaches its climax, such as it is, at a wedding reception of the daughter of Gloria's best coupled friends from her marriage.  The director apparently loves the  old Van Morrison song ""Gloria,"" so he has the wedding guests singing and dancing to it.  Her two old friends draw Gloria into the center of the dancing and her whirling and singing her namesake song is meant to be her moment of victory over her desperate emptiness and loneliness.

But I didn't see anything in her behavior during the film to draw me to the director's conclusion - or that of the critics.  I just saw a woman of a certain age as lost as ever.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 9, 2014","Once you get past how refreshingly and realistically this film portrays the middle-aged, you can't help but realize that the great performances are really the only things that elevate the rest of the experience. It's actually tedious, slow, and dull, but not in an understated or contextually appropriate manner. It's kind of like three quarters of the second act doesn't even work. The ending is very cute, but I was still surprisingly bored throughout, and this is coming from someone that absolutely loved Somewhere. 5.9/10, underwhelming, one thumb down, below average, etc.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 23, 2013","If you look for reality or honesty in filming, you'll find this movie charming and so touching, as what ""Sebastián Lelio"" is something goes inside the daily details of a female character who still feels young although she is not that.

""Gloria"" (Paulina García) a divorced woman since 12 years, is just trying to live freely, to find herself, to express her feeling, but it's not easy at that age, so the happiness and miseries are parallel and cannot be separated. She give a nice photo about a mother who knew how to grow up her two kids independently, the opposite of ""Rodolfo"" (Sergio Hernández) another divorced man she felt in love with, which couldn't live any moment for himself faraway of his daughters. After feeling her vulnerability to this proportional love she get up on it. That's not a morality story or a comedy leans on mocking, that's a strictly real one. It's how the past can't be deleted off us.

Though it sounds a cultured one, nothing new in the script, no thrilling. It's just a drama with everything expected, and  this dryness (Paulina Garcià) ""Gloria"" with her remarkable talent will make up for all, by her daring, smile, and passion. I cannot consider it as a great movie nor even excellent, it's amusing.. funny sometimes, black and deep other times, and exactly feelings-fraught. Lovely art production, performances, and soundtracks. The songs are really so suitable for the story, so the end will sound convincing although it's sad and simple. There are a lot of nudity and explicit sex scene, they were not that necessary for me but they are accepted, anyway especially from two old couple. A bit bored of it, feels nothing original? well, you're right, we all was waiting for something stronger in the end.

What is to be considers is that this movie is about a middle-aged women, what Hollywood continuously fails to make this kind of movies touching. So you can feel this now.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 13, 2013","Es increíble lo envolvente que es ""Gloria"" sin aparente esfuerzo. Pero debe ser difícil crear una cinta tan natural y realista, con una protagonista con la cual podamos simpatizar a pesar de sus fallas. Paulina Garcia da una extraordinaria actuación en el rol titular, como una mujer divorciada que vive sola pero que disfruta la vida al máximo (la historia se enfoca en un breve período donde se enamora de un hombre que conoce en una fiesta). ""Gloria"", inesperadamente, es una de las películas más memorables del 2013. Muy recomendable.",POSITIVE
"Dec 11, 2013","I saw a preview for ""Gloria"", a film I'd never heard anything about, before All Is Lost"" last month (a few months ago?) and immediately dismissed it as claptrap fluff. Turns out I was wrong! Would never have guessed I'd like this more than ""Enough Said"". Where that movie has a sugar-sweet vibe and is (maybe too) generous with its characters, ""Gloria"" is more specific, by turns emotionally jarring, attenuated and complex. In that director SebastiÃÂ¡n Lelio's film speaks universal volumes about self-discovery in individuality during the back half of life. (This would make a weirdly perfect double-feature with ""The To Do List"".) Also Paulina GarcÃÂ­a, in every frame of ""Gloria"", is absolutely radiant as the slaphappy title broad on the lookout for love. Yeah the ending is weak and super slippery with its symbolism, so much so it had to have been earmarked as a final ovation (you'll know what I mean). But that's forgivable. ""Gloria"" still feels like a dime a dozen. (80/100)",POSITIVE
"Dec 1, 2013","Sebastián Lelio's sensitive, empathetic approach to the romantic life of Gloria, the kind of woman you see on the street, is a powerfully emotional, rather mordant experience, cleverly-written script filled with quibbling, while anchored by Paulina García's right-on-the-spot performance on the title character.",POSITIVE

"Nov 4, 2013","Garcia's nuanced and delicate performance in the lead role is undeniably the draw here but just as significant and refreshing is a script dealing with the intriguing but painfully emotional subject of loneliness and the love lives of those a little more senior in our society - and what happens after the children have all grown up: whether they decide to flee the nest or stay firmly within. The only false note for me would be the ending that feels typical of indie films of this sort (cue the ambiguous yet misleadingly euphoric dance) but otherwise, this Chilean film is a little gem that deserves a wider audience.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 29, 2013","Con un titolo del genere, questa pellicola cilena ora candidata all'Oscar come miglior film straniero non può non far pensare all'omonimo lavoro di John Cassavetes, un altro ritratto di donna che non si scoraggia di fronte alle avversità. La differenza è che qui gli scogli sono quelli della vita di ogni giorno, ambito narrativo al quale il cineasta di New York ha peraltro dedicato tanti suoi film: se ci si aggiunge il nome di un altro autore bravissimo nel mettere in immagini la poesia delle piccole cose - François Truffaut, di cui sono fan ante marcia - si può ben capire che 'Gloria' mi faccia l'effetto di quei dischi magari di secondo piano, cercati con zelo o incontrati per caso, che restano ignorati dai più, ma sono capaci di scaldare il cuore. La Gloria di Lelio è una donna di mezza età con un buon lavoro, ma separata da un pezzo e con i figli ormai adulti, che non rinuncia a vivere: draga i locali per cuori solitari dove, a un bel momento, trova di nuovo l'amore sotto le spoglie di Rodolfo, che la affascina grazie al garbo e alle chiacchiere, ma ben presto si rivela ben diverso dalle apparenze. Tutto comincia a scricchiolare durante una riunione di famiglia con Gabriel, l'ex marito di Gloria, e i ragazzi che si dibattono nei loro problemi: Rodolfo dimostra di non riuscire a staccarsi dal nucleo famigliare che proclama di aver da un anno abbandonato e si ostina a voler tenere il piede in due scarpe. La donna fa di tutto per salvare la relazione - compreso un imbarazzante, in tutti i sensi, soggiorno a Vinha del Mar - poi decide che è meglio darci un taglio e ripartire un'altra volta: accetta il gatto del vicino (l'animale più brutto mai visto sullo schermo), riprende a cantare fra sé e, nella bella scena finale, finisce anche per liberarsi di quella sorta di segno del passato costituito dagli occhialoni che certo non le giovano. Ne esce un ritratto a tutto tondo di una donna forte e volitiva che non si nasconde le miserie della vita, ma cerca sempre di superarle senza piangersi addosso, bensì sforzandosi di spostare più in là i limiti della propria esistenza: per costruire e rendere efficace una simile rappresentazione, ogni particolare è importante, tanto è vero che se c'è un film dove le scene di nudo e di sesso non sono superflue è questo. Detto che la forza di rialzarsi e andare avanti della protagonista ha anche, con ogni probabilità, un sottofondo politico - si vedano la manifestazione a cui Gloria cammina accanto oppure l'accenno alla necessità, per il Cile, di trovare nuove energie e persone per voltare pagina - quello che conta davvero è il fine disegno psicologico della figura principale (a cui Paulina Garcia regala un'interpretazione di grande intensità che le è valso l'Orso d'argento come miglior attrice) e la riuscita sottolineatura di quelle di contorno: gli uomini ci fanno ben misera figura, tra l'irresolutezza mista a pusillanimità di Rodolfo e l'infantilismo di Gabriel, a confronto di donne che si prendono la responsabilità delle proprie azioni, come Ana che accetta di andare in capo al mondo per amore e per necessità. Dopo tutte queste considerazioni, non sorprende che il film si svolga principalmente in interni, mentre attorno Santiago è solo uno sfondo come tanti perché la storia si potrebbe svolgere ovunque: in tale ambientazione, il regista lavora soprattutto di primi piani e inquadrature strette, sottolineando dialoghi scritti con gusto e che mai vanno fuori dalle righe. Dalla combinazione scaturisce il giusto passo con cui la storia viene raccontata, tranquilla come la quotidianità, ma mai banale o noiosa. (Come? Umberto Tozzi? Sì, c'è, state tranquilli. E pure in spagnolo...)",POSITIVE
"Oct 23, 2013","Chile's entry for the 2014 Foreign Language Oscar is the character study of Gloria (Garcia), a middle-aged, middle-class divorcee who prowls the mature singles clubs of Santiago, looking for her Senor Goodbar. A series of encounters with men leads nowhere until she meets paintball park owner Rodolfo (Hernandez), an odd but charming man who, like Gloria, has come through a divorce. The two plunge quickly into a passionate relationship but Rodolfo's behavior becomes increasingly antisocial and his ex-wife and two adult daughters (who refuse to work while he supports them financially) are a constant menace.
Cinema so often behaves like a playground bully, stealing from other artforms to paper over the deficiencies of uninventive film-makers. Music is so often the victim. How many times have you been moved by a scene in an otherwise unremarkable film, only to wonder if it's the director's choice of a great piece of music that's stirring your emotions, rather than any great piece of visual film-making? There are three such moments in Sebastian Lelio's latest film; a charming group singalong to Brazilian songwriter Antonio Carlos Jobim's beautiful tune 'Aguas de Marco', a Kubrickian shot of a disconsolate Gloria in a hair salon with the adagietto from Mahler's fifth symphony (one of the most overused pieces of music in cinema since its iconic use in 'Death in Venice') playing in the background (Chilean hairdressers seemingly have far more sophisticated musical taste than their European counterparts), and a final cathartic dance to a Spanish language cover of Laura Branigan's eighties hit 'Gloria'. All three are stirring moments in their own right but Lelio and his film have done nothing to earn such borrowed euphoria. 

Aside from a hilariously offbeat revenge scene involving a paintball gun, the film is bland, humorless and quite tedious. Gloria isn't a particularly interesting character (though Garcia is admittedly outstanding in the role) and if her creator intends us to sympathize with her he's way off the mark. Her actions are mostly infuriating and she's the type of character you want to shake rather than hug. The film has no real direction and subplots (an insane young neighbor, her daughter's pregnancy) lead nowhere. There's an interesting film to be made about a character like Gloria (most likely by a female film-maker) but Lelio doesn't seem to be the one to pull it off.",NEGATIVE
