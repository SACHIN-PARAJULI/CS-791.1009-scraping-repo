"Apr 11, 2024","A masterpiece showing what would happen if a mentally ill would make his worst ideas real, most stunningly depicted by Joaquin Phoenix. He definitely earned his Oscar.
To me it's the best film so far taking place in the universe of an American superhero franchise. An absolute must-watch.",POSITIVE
"Apr 10, 2024","Excellent acting and cinematography, but of the 1000's of movies I've seen, there are only 2 that I would call disturbingly irresponsible pieces of art.  This is one.  Don't waste your time, it's 2 hours you'll never get back.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 10, 2024","Well mental illness and struggles are hard to define from person to person ...I am over 60 ..in pain with arthritis and loosing hearing plus anxiety & depression as conjoined twins .. which I never thought I would get to at this stage ...but finding anyone putting these awful issues of trauma ...hurt ..despise ...vengeful thoughts ?? I came out of the cinema pretty shaken and first words were ...' what the hell did I just see' ...I was put on the spot of my own issues of hate or seething..misunderstanding and just wearing life with a smile.
I have watched many a DC and Marvel commentary on the big screen ..some with 'pow' ...'zap' and gotcha ...to some nonsense 3 hour slog of bum.numness..which has beat me...what Todd gave us was not refreshing but a mirror to society of our current understanding that mental illness and struggle are too hard to deal with or comprehend (plus violence)  ..how to work it out ..so we going to visit part 2 and I stayed alive thus far to make it to part 2 ...however ...one day ...it will count for so much more than comic books or  madness ...mayhem please see further than the end of popcorn stuffed noses and cheese stuffed nachos ...and endless pepsi refills.",POSITIVE
"Apr 10, 2024",One of the most unwatchable movies I have ever had the displeasure of viewing.,NEGATIVE
"Apr 10, 2024","An okay movie. Worth a watch. 
My two biggest problems are:
1. Why did this need to be a batman movie? If you took the exact same plot, set it in Chicago, took out Thomas Wayne and replaced him with some other billionaire, and instead of calling himself joker at the end, he called himself something else, would it actually change the story? I don't think so.
2. The story's themes had been done better in other movies decades ago. For the modern generation of superhero fans who've never seen films like Taxi driver, King of comedy or Falling down, the film might seem groundbreaking, but those films did the same thing and they did them much better. 
It's basically a Taxi driver, King of comedy mashup with a hint of Falling down with a Batman coat of paint slapped on it.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 29, 2024","Was going into this film with low expectations, and boy did it surpass them! A very gritty and dark realism take on the Joker Character. Makes you see the world from his eyes and at points makes you feel a sense of dread just as the story's protagonist does. Nearly a flawless film in my opinion. Only main gripe is that this feels like a psychological horror film with Batman elements thrown in. But this is definitely a must watch for any movie goer.",POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024","Son unas de las mejores representaciones del origen del conocido personaje Joker, su oscuro pasado le da un toque al personaje dando más explicación sobre su personalidad demente.",POSITIVE

"Feb 24, 2024","I didn't expect to enjoy the movie, but was surprised to discover it was much deeper than expected, and very satisfying.",POSITIVE
"Feb 24, 2024","I usually steer clear of films that consist of such disturbing themes but Joker was a brilliant exposition of the dispossessed and alienated in our society. I doubt anyone except Joaquin Phoenix could have carried the story the way he did, thoroughly deserving his Oscar.",POSITIVE
"Feb 23, 2024","So, if you asked me to describe Joker, I'd tell you it's an art film first and foremost. This is deconstructing the Joker mythos and applying it to a grittier Gotham backdrop for the sake of relatability and sympathy. I'm all for a sympathetic villain, but this was almost excessive. If it weren't an art film. Art films get a pass on heavy-handed social commentary, to me, because the ideas are meant to be impressionable. Very slow moving, kind of boring, but overall a decent film. Wouldn't watch again.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 20, 2024","How excelent of an actor do you have to be, for the viewer to forget the world around him and feel the pain the main character goes trough",POSITIVE
"Feb 19, 2024",Was extremely boring.,NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2024","Joker is a fantastic film, and a compelling origin for Joker. The whole film was enjoyable, though I would say that the second half is far better than the first half, and it's not particularly close. If the whole movie was as good as the second half, it would probably be a five-star. That's not to say the first half wasn't compelling or good, but it just couldn't really match the second half. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is nothing short of amazing, with his near-perfect portrayal of Arthur's descent into madness, which is a great time to watch. The overarching plot is also very well written, witch kept my eyes glued to the screen for nearly the entire runtime. This film was also really lacking in side characters, with almost all of them being very forgettable and uninteresting, which really left only one good character (albeit one very good character) carrying its entire 122 minute runtime. Besides these flaws though, Joker is a fantastic origin story for one of the greatest villains in media, and a great film. I can't wait to see what's coming next in the sequel.",POSITIVE
"Feb 17, 2024","It's pretty stupid, really.  It's like going to hear a rock band and the guitar player solos almost the entire time. There's nothing real in it.  A total wank that's been done before and alot better.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2024",Very god the realism the final,POSITIVE
"Feb 15, 2024",The build up origins of batman and joker at same time at the end was nuts the cast 10/10 soundtrack 10/10 the story was crazy humor 10/10,POSITIVE
"Feb 15, 2024",By far and away the greatest film that I do not ever want to watch again.,POSITIVE
"Feb 11, 2024","Yet another captivating performance per Joaquin Phoenix. Joker heavily touches on the outside influences society has on those with mental illness, as well as how society treats those with mental illness. Oh, and just what mental illness can look like from the perspective of the maniacal. For those thinking Joker has depression.... touch up on your crazy, they don't all come with blues. Some appear in shades of vibrant red and yellow.",POSITIVE
"Feb 10, 2024",Feels less like a comic based movie and more like an unhelpful telling of mental illness.,NEGATIVE
"Feb 9, 2024","A real POC, don't waste your time.  The high audience rating must  have come from a prison audience.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 8, 2024","So dissapointed. I wish I had never seen or heard of this movie so I can go back to thinking to joker was an amazing villain. This movie unequivocally ruined the character, his original reasonings, and his original motivations. Wondering why joker could possibly be the way he is, is unfathomably better than this being why he is how he is. There is nothing wrong with mental illness, but insanity was the every foundation of the joker to me and that's gone now. I do not wish to spoil to the movie for you if you insist on seeing it, but I'll make a comparison to help convey what you will experience. Imagine Batman was actually Batman because he used to be a baseball player and wanted to make a pun, and he has a medical condition that causes his voice to go deeper. Also he actually refuses to kill anyone because he stopped seeing his imaginary friend when he was little, and doesn't want to see anyone else he meets disappear. That's the impeccable storytelling you're in for folks",NEGATIVE
"Feb 6, 2024","This is the most unpleasant movie experience I've had since the first IT movie a couple years ago. My hopes were high considering the awards attention it got - culminating in a Best Actor Oscar for Phoenix. But this is an empty, superficial movie that doesn't offer any context about violence beyond what the average viewer would bring to it. I can't begin to understand the adulation this received. I won't fault Phoenix's work here - he is as committed as ever. But this is yet another case of a brilliant actor being rewarded for the wrong film. This is an ugly movie, both aesthetically and beneath the surface. Comparisons to TAXI DRIVER were made upon its release; and while I think TAXI DRIVER is a bit overrated, it is miles ahead of this movie, and I didn't find any similarities beyond a disgruntled protagonist. If you want to see a movie about the destruction of a man due to the world around him, please check out Jake Gyllenhaal in NIGHTCRAWLER instead. De Niro appears very uncomfortable in a supporting role that obviously will be compared to Jerry Lewis in THE KING OF COMEDY. This is bleak, unremitting and ultimately predictable. A crushing disappointment!",NEGATIVE
"Jan 29, 2024","Phoenix has his well deserved Oscar winning performance. 
Scary enough to make you feel sorry for his evilness, yet not so evil as simply proving a point of how humanities ignorance brings out the worst in us all.",POSITIVE
"Jan 25, 2024","This has become one of my favorite movies of all time! The acting, the story, the music and directing, it's all well thought out and presented perfectly. It's also a moral story, warning of what would happen should the rich keep getting richer, while the rest of us wallow in despair. And it also warns of what happens when those who need help most are left alone, backs turned in a callous mega city, becoming monsters made by man. And just like Godzilla was sent to punish man, Joker is sent to make everyone pay, a monster unable to be anything else, and a chilling source of pure evil.",POSITIVE
"Jan 24, 2024","Garbage...it's best feature is it helped me to further appreciate Tim Burton's Batman, which is far superior. Phoenix and DeNiro's talents are totally wasted here, with a story that is not just poor but downright offensive, whether intended or not.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 24, 2024",Wonderful portrayl of a broken man whose the society makes him this way,POSITIVE
"Jan 21, 2024",Es la mejor actuación de Joaquin Phoenix de su carrera y una excelente interpretación del Joker la película te mantiene siempre esperando la siguiente escena por lo que merece una secuela Joker 2,POSITIVE
"Jan 17, 2024",Absolutely gorgeous and fantastic,POSITIVE
"Jan 17, 2024","I really like Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie doesn't add anything to his repertoire. It's too goofy for a serious drama, and too depressing for a superhero (supervillain?) movie. The entire premise begs the question, so the entertainment value is doomed to the perversity of voyeurism.

It's a good thing this is a standalone story because if this were where the Joker persona is headed, I would stop watching Batman productions altogether.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 16, 2024",i actually liked it. not that bad! i fuckim love watching embarrassing shiz,NEUTRAL
"Jan 15, 2024","A completely value inverted world, where the low-life loser is depicted as a hero. That's what makes it completely unrealistic, bordering on fantasy... A fantasy of nihilism.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 15, 2024",Great movie.  It is one of the few comic based movies that is truly great.,POSITIVE
"Jan 14, 2024","In my opinion better than suicide squad joker. This one gets to the development the reality of how someone like joker can come to be. It's more closely related to reality, on top of it this joker reminds me of my childhood joker from the cartoon batman. The laugh is on point, his hysteria, I love that the fact how they woven his joker personality not because of a chemical accident but because of a psychopathology. Suicide squad joker, was the average bad guy joker. Joaquin Phoenix is the 2nd best up to Heath Ledger's joker.",POSITIVE
"Jan 13, 2024",It was a good movie but also one of the saddest and depressing movies.,POSITIVE
"Jan 13, 2024",A dizzying contradiction of a film. The ideas that 'Joker' forces you to evaluate make this much more unique and worthwhile than your average comic fare.,POSITIVE
"Jan 13, 2024",The movie has no action. I thought the joker was a maniacle violent clown going on a killing spree and blowing things up. Heath Ledger was better. Phoenix is boring the worst joker. The movie is taking too long to show the violent side of joker.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 10, 2024","I really love this film, this film is one of my favorites, everything about this film is very perfect, the soundtrack, the characters, etc...",POSITIVE
"Jan 9, 2024","Absolutely loved it! It depicts just how wrong the mental health facilities are and what happens when those who need it don't get help. It's ""beautifully sad"". Would and have recommended this movie! If you haven't seen it, do it. Just don't expect too much ""Batman"" there are easter eggs here and there but it's mainly a movie about why Joker/Arthur is the way he is.",POSITIVE
"Jan 9, 2024","This is a movie made by people who definitely have seen ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"" several times but didn't really understand either movie. This results in a tiresome spectacle of it appearing to say something profound but can't manage any meaningful observations besides ""Wow, society sure sucks."" I'm not opposed to darker comic book adaptations for adults but I really don't want this uninspired nihilism to become the norm.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 7, 2024","A powerful movie, very interesting would definitely watch again",POSITIVE
"Jan 7, 2024","85/100 - Fantastic film. Joaqiun pheonix did an exceptional job playing this troubled character. My only complaint is that if you watch this film and the batman films related to it, the story is incoherent as each one tries to make you sympathize with the main character. The wayne family is portrayed as cruel upper class elitist, whereas in the batman films they were portrayed as loving parents taken too soon. I just wish that the continuity of the stories blended better, but as an independent story its very good.",POSITIVE
"Jan 7, 2024","I was quite surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. It was a lot more serious and complex than I thought it would be, but I think they succeeded in everything they were trying to do. Great movie, really enjoyed how mature it was.",POSITIVE
"Jan 7, 2024","You couldn't offer me $1,000,000 to sit through this garbage again. Movies are meant to be entertaining, not disturbing; I fear young people may want to view this with high expectations, only to be subjected to violence.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 7, 2024",I love the joker so much dressed up as it for Halloween killed it and Joaguin just killed this part. He sacrificed a lot to get this part too it payed off can't wait for the second one with Lady Gaga!!!.,POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2024","I thought this movie was well written, and well acted, I just thought that it was very disturbing and it was very uncomfortable to watch, especially someone who used to have mental health problems

And this movie touches on mental health, illness, from a villain standpoint of a superhero movie, so at the end of the day he's supposed to be a clown. He's supposed to be silly and funny and goofy and a villain, but he was a serial killer and a lunatic, which we know from the comics

But we are not putting in that position as children to see that on a big screen, we see him as Jack Nicholson, or as someone that delivers more of that I'm a Batman, villain. Batman has the best villains of all time, but this movie made him a complete sociopath.

And it literally made it extremely uncomfortable after the film watching it. I definitely wouldn't let my kids watch it.",NEUTRAL

"Nov 25, 2023","An origin story for the clown-prince of crime has never been so dreary and realistic!

"Nov 20, 2023","Between BRIGHTBURN and BATMAN BEGINS - a reinvention of character-building

While DC branched out with an evil version of Superman in Brightburn, it also built the sympathetically good side of Joker with Joaquin Phoenix. Played as a study of psychology in motion, this was one of the best superhero-based movies to be released on the big screen, even though it was all about the supervillain. Phoenix's performance is gut-grippingly good, and the supporting actors deliver perfectly on-point performances. The flexible and ambidextrous abilities of DC are amazing; feeding off human nature and building characters whose stories are a presence beyond the capabilities of most screenwriting. Joker's struggles are brought to light even while we (the community of comic readers) know that his infliction is venomous and unhealable. Truly a multilayered story, Joker is one of the best movies to come out in the 21st century, thus far.",POSITIVE
"Nov 15, 2023","Joquin Phoenix performance is stellar and the soundtrack is really good.
Robert DeNiro has a fantastic performance in this movie and the ambientation is perfect.

"Nov 9, 2023","Joker is just one of those movies, that resinate with me in a way no other movie ever has. The music itself plays so much emotion, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is outstanding, and the movie is just so beautiful in itself.",POSITIVE
"Nov 7, 2023","This movie is amazing. I had hoped that more directors would take their cues from this but it seems that the comics moviemakers have decided to go in the other, predictable direction. The Joker is a tour de force that captures the spirit of the character and makes you truly feel for his situation and what made him the monster. Phoenix is a masterful actor in this. Jared Leto should be ashamed of himself after what he had done to the character in Suicide Squad. I wrote off this movie until my Mom just about forced me to watch it. Then I did and at the end I was breathless. Thank you, Mr. Phoenix, for proving that the tired ""superhero genre"" still has life in it.

So why didn't more directors follow suit? I cannot understand. But perhaps that's what makes The Joker all the more special…",POSITIVE
"Nov 7, 2023","This dives into what it takes to break a person. Childhood trauma....mental health....and the cancer that's the general public.  

Think it also speaks to the jokers inept ability to keep us guessing.  Is this the real version he doesn't tell? Or just another manipulation from a psychotic mind justifying his actions.",POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2023",very dark movie well acted reminded me of the film taxi driver. cool supervillian origin story kinda like the film Split but way darker joquin phonixs performance is worth watching dark and gritty film id say its worth a watch if u can handle hard r rated films definetly not for kids.,POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2023","From Todd Phillips comes a new take on Joker starring Joaquin Phoenix as the iconic Batman villain in a prequel character study where Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) goes from being a broken, down-and-out party clown to the king of chaos in Gotham City.

Arthur is a lonely clown-for-hire with a sick mother he still lives with and a condition prompting him to laugh uncontrollably in the most awkward moments. He dreams of being a stand-up comedian but, between his condition, his increasingly dire work situation and bombshell revelations at home, it becomes harder and harder for him to see the funny side. Especially when the people around Arthur seem hellbent on making his life even more of a living hell. The only bright spark in all this is Arthur's neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz) who lives down the hall and is the only one showing him any form of affection. After losing his job, an altercation on the subway ends in bloodshed and things take a turn for the worse. Seeing his hero, talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), embarrass him on national television certainly doesn't help things either.

Much has been said about Joker since its release, with some dismissing it as a derivative, simplistic society-made-me-do-it tale while others called it a masterpiece. Admittedly, Joker owes a lot to early Martin Scorsese works like Taxi Driver and King Of Comedy but it's also clear that the casting of Robert De Niro in a major role is no accident: this is a nod to those other grim anti-hero character studies, with a comic book twist. To be fair, the Tim Burton Batman films were pure German Expressionism, X-Men spin-off Logan evoked classic westerns, every comic book movie is derivative in some way, Joker is simply more obvious about what inspired it.

And this point leads me to what I think is the most apt criticism one can make about this film. It does everything it sets out to do extremely well but often in a slightly too obvious or heavy-handed way. From the moody cello-led score (which is admittedly very good) to Arthur's clearly unjust treatment at work and at home, and the recurrent laughter/crying contrast, this is exactly what you'd expect an ant melting under a magnifying glass to look like and there's not much there to be surprised about, except perhaps one twist near the end of the film. 

What Joker lacks in originality, however, it makes up for in sheer competence. Joaquin Phoenix gives another phenomenal performance: his take on the Joker is very different than any we've seen before even if, costume-wise, there's a clear Heath Ledger vibe. His Arthur Fleck is so fragile it makes numerous scenes quite uncomfortable to watch. That skinny, frail frame and arched back, every wrinkle on Phoenix's face is like a scar telling a story, his muted voice with its tone that's always slightly off, the impromptu dances. Arthur, we come to find, was the performance all along and Joker was the painful truth underneath it all.

This isn't the story of a man pushed to his limits by society, though he does use that as a convenient excuse for his wrongdoings and society certainly didn't help. This is a story about how mental illness and physical abuse, if left untreated or misdiagnosed, coupled with financial strain and a rough upbringing, can force people into unsustainable performances of themselves that will inevitably clash with the world around them and how they really feel. Arthur is not just some angry guy who flips out one day because people are mean to him, he's a man with deeply embedded psychological issues that were never addressed, let alone resolved. What little medical help he is provided with is just not good enough and, when even that is taken away from him, what happens next is tragic yet it feels inevitable.

The themes explored in Joker are important and relevant with director Todd Phillips approaching the iconic villain, his emotions and even the Batman comics as a whole, with a lot of respect and attention to detail. While we empathize with Arthur and his tragic life story, his Joker persona is never truly glorified (except by himself) and his crimes are never excused, even with the social unrest brewing in Gotham City providing just the right environment for them. 

A key scene in which he confronts his idol-turned-rival Murray Franklin shows him try to rationalize his behavior and, when that doesn't fly with the audience or Murray himself, he resorts to a senseless act of violence. This proves he is unable to excuse what he's done yet it also facilitates his ascension into a symbol of anarchy and chaos. Ultimately, it's the positive attention given to him by a niche group of rioters willing to adopt this destructive mentality that wins over in the end.

Joker won't be to everyone's taste but it remains a carefully crafted, masterfully acted film with a lot more depth than most comic-book movies and there's something refreshing about seeing an origin story that's about the character but also about bigger, more relatable things. It'll be interesting to see where follow-up projects in the same vein will go from there.

Fantastic, no joke.",POSITIVE

"Oct 25, 2023","The scenario told in this film depicts a situation in which we frequently disregard the feelings and situations of others around us, people who may not have the same advantages as us. We can sense the psychological upheaval that Joker is experiencing from his point of view. All disappointment and rage build up and eventually explode. The people of Gotham rebelled as a result of their dissatisfaction and indignation at the injustice they faced. 

The Joker is also seen dancing on a car in the midst of the rioting, surrounded by people shouting his name. Making them an embodiment of ""Hero"" in order for them to share their ideas.

"Oct 24, 2023","Mikey's Movie Review: Joker (2019)
Todd Phillips' channels the spirit of prime era Martin Scorsese, blurring lines of fantasy and a hyper-reality, to create one of the most emotionally challenging films in recent memory. Arthur Fleck, a lonely clown for hire and aspiring stand-up comedian, is trapped in a city and a world that doesn't care. The everyday apathy and cruelty he endures only antagonizing his worsening mental condition and affliction (he laughs painfully and uncontrollably when confronted, nervous or hurting.). He wants to fit in. He wants to be loved. He wants to be happy. The system has failed him. On reaching breaking point Arthur fights back, beginning a violent chain reaction that will ultimately lead to a catharsis, and a life changing metamorphosis...
While the additional cast are excellent throughout, the film is essentially a one man character study, and Joaquin Phoenix brings Arthur to vivid, heartbreaking life in every scene. It's a testimony to his ability that we more than empathize with the character, that despite his later deplorable actions, we understand and even except his reasons. Both Phillips and Phoenix pushing our expectations and our boundaries. 
As a result Joker will no doubt split regular audiences more used to a softer, purely fantastical approach to comic figures. But DC has long pushed the limits and explored darker, more adult themes in their graphic novels and even animated features. Alan Moore's 'The Killing Joke', Ed Brubaker's 'The Man Who Laughs' and Frank Millers 'The Dark Knight Returns' to name but a few. Since his inception as Batman's No.1 nemesis almost 80 years ago, every generation has reinvented and reinterpreted the Joker to fit with the times. It's telling that in 2019, this is the Joker we need and deserve...

"Oct 21, 2023","A movie that deserves all the praise it gets. Joaquin Phoenix crushes his role as Arthur Fleck or ""Joker"" as he makes you feel Arthur's emotions throughout the entire film. Todd Phillips' camera work is impeccable as he makes the audience feel like this is a real life event and never fails to keep the audience from hanging on the edge of our seat.",POSITIVE
"Oct 21, 2023","It is hauntingly beautiful. The music, the colors, the dialogues. We are all jokers and in this film you see how so many are formed.",POSITIVE
"Oct 20, 2023","Effortlessly iconic, and the vibe and mood for this film was tremendous. Delivering on such a complex character's personality and mood was no easy feat, but Joker succeeded at that and then some.",POSITIVE
"Oct 14, 2023","Joker, what can I say about this masterpiece? It's an excellent film, where we see Arthur being shaped by society, we see in the film how Gotham's social structure has enormous prejudice towards those who have mental problems. Mental problems are one of the key points of the plot. Joker, by Todd Phillips, is a film in which we have a deep character, with shaken social cycles, left in a city where the poorest serve as a carpet for the rich, we have Arthur, who suffers enough to the point of becoming the terror of that fragile society.",POSITIVE
"Oct 8, 2023","Una película perfecta en todo su esplendor, aveces DC Comics no decepciona en la hora de hacer estas películas. Una de las mejores películas de 2019 y una de las taquilleras de la historia de DC Comics. La actuación de Joaquín Phoenix es sin duda la mejor de toda su carrera y vaya que se tiene merecido ese Oscar a mejor actor.",POSITIVE
"Oct 7, 2023","As I age, I tend to avoid superhero movies, but intrigued by the Oscars and positive reviews, I took a chance on this one. I'm thrilled I did. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal was brilliant, deserving of the Best Actor Oscar. The story, stunts, and direction were exceptional. Kudos to everyone involved in this fantastic film. Highly recommend!",POSITIVE
"Oct 7, 2023",The character development in this movie is really good!,POSITIVE
"Oct 5, 2023","This is a pretty decent movie about mental health, is it a Joker movie... No, this has almost no relation to any of the comic stuff, I get that it's trying to be different, but honestly Arthur Fleck is no genius laughing mastermind, Joaquin is great though, it really got the message across that we live in a society.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 5, 2023",I love this movie it shows what our social can cause and how we treat others best both the dark knight and Joker are the best movies that DC has made,POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2023","I love this movie. The way Joker was portrayed in this film is perfect, and realistic. It shows how Joker became Joker. Who was he? Joaquin Phoenix is a phenomenal actor, and did such an amazing job transforming into Joker.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2023",Amazingly fresh and dark take on a classic DC comic book character. The movie is a slow burning masterpiece that fully delivers on its title JOKER.,POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2023","Gave it a second watch, got so much better.
Do it too, you'll not regret it.",POSITIVE
"Oct 1, 2023","I really wish that I could give this movie a TEN Stat rating!!! 

""The worst part about having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave as if you don't."" -Joker 

If you go into this movie expecting it to be a Batman/Joker superhero kind of movie, you may be a little bit disappointed. It's not that kind of thing, particularly! HOWEVER, I will say that the movie does a FANTASTIC job at speaking about and bringing light to the everyday challenges foe those of us who struggle with mental health needs, and the stigma that's behind it in society - particularly American society. 

It's not really a superhero movie, unless you believe in the ideation that villains are just heros of their own story (which I do).",POSITIVE
"Oct 1, 2023",Es una buena película muy divertida un origen muy interesante es buenísima el humor es bueno el joker es Carismático y es gran película y me encanta el soudtrack es un 9.5 de 10,POSITIVE
"Sep 29, 2023",Had to watch it twice to confirm my initial thoughts. This movie is a masterpiece through and through. It's reveling as it is discomforting. The quirks and antics the infamous Joker possesses are given eye-opening meaning behind them which does take a level of maturity to be able to view the picture with more depth. You will feel a bit torn by the character Joaquin beautifully portrays but moved by the scenes and cinematic shots that take you with him. One of my top movies I'll have to say.,POSITIVE
"Sep 27, 2023","Good movie, Idk will I watch it again, It started off slow, Then it start getting good, I like the joker, Joaquin Phoenix did great as the joker, It's sad all he went through his life before coming the joker, And its violent and bloody too, I heard part 2 coming in 2024,  3/5",NEUTRAL

"Sep 17, 2023",The grimness and darkness of the film should be embraced. And Joaquin Phoenix's performance should be memorialized.,POSITIVE
"Sep 17, 2023","In my humble opinion, this is probably the top 10, book movie of all time in the top three DC movies of all time because This is what The DCEU needed. More character driven stories to be honest, more elsewhere or not a movie that’s connected with the main universe type movie because this right here to me is a masterpiece. This is definitely a different interpretation of the Joker because if you look back, this was supposed to be Jared Leto’s joker having a standalone film, but that did not work because first the carrier did not have any compelling things that he can do on his own plus DC was trying to catch up with the MCU Since the NCU was popular made a lot of money and people wouldn’t stop talking about it but on this movie, this felt like a DC movie plus very inspired by Martin Scorseses King of comedy and taxi driver, but featuring the joker the reason that this my top 10 comic book movies of all time and possibly top three or top two DC movies of all time is because it’s character driven and make a sympathize on the insanity and the crazy personality of the Joker because this is a good evil movie meaning that this is another protagonist movie which I like movie We are placed in a point of view of how Gotham is tearing apart itself, and how Gotham is tearing apart our own characters, and the core reason why this movie works for me because the stuff that he doing we should not be on his side throughout this whole movie he’s killing he’s murdering His own “parent” He’s killing without remorse, but we don’t turn on him. We still are on his side because the people around him are making him be this way. The people around him is making him have the right to kill them because Treat him badly and how It represents Gotham on a daily basis, and that right there is something DC needs to learn to understand their characters. And the performance by Phoenix isn’t no heath ledger, but it’s up there with the best performances in comic book history overall, this movie is what dc is  all about, and the dark Knight, and the Batman, where is not trying to be like like other comic movies, or like the MCU, it is its own thing, more darker, more gritty, more deeper characters, and more deeper movies 10/10",POSITIVE

"Sep 16, 2023",Really? Maybe it's good I mean the actors definitely did a brilliant work but the plot is really suck. Everything when it is over-correct will go wrong to the other side.,NEGATIVE
"Sep 16, 2023","Absolutely fantastic in every way. This was an incredibly fresh take in the superhero/villain genre—there are no unrealistic superpowers or flashy stunts. This made an iconic comic character relatable and enjoyable for people who aren't fans of the Marvel/DC comics and movies. It had significant plot twists randomly placed throughout the movie, which isn't a luxury many movies spoil you with. In my opinion, Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is supreme above all overs and will be for years to come.",POSITIVE
"Sep 13, 2023",GOAT acting by Joaquin Phoenix.,POSITIVE
"Sep 12, 2023","Sure I'm a Marvel guy, but this has gotta be one of the best DC movies I've seen. Joaquin Phoenix nailed it.",POSITIVE
"Sep 11, 2023","Joker is a compelling masterpiece that explores the descent into madness of the iconic villain, the Joker, portrayed brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix. Set in a bleak Gotham City, the film delves into societal issues and features outstanding cinematography and a haunting score. It's a character-driven narrative that challenges viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about society and human nature.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 11, 2023","The true unsettling reality lies not in the Joker's grotesquery, but in the unexpected sympathy you may find yourself feeling towards him, a sensation that can be profoundly unsettling.",POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2023",Atemporal. Um filme lendário sobre um dos melhores e mais complexos vilões da cultura pop.,POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2023","Great acting, but an unsatisfying conclusion and a completely ridiculous message.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 9, 2023","My favorite Joker since Ledger, Joaquin absolutely deserved that Oscar, I'm glad they're making a sequel because i want more of Joaquin as Joker instead of Arthur, he's really the perfect cast as Joker, pretty sure Arthur Fleck is just a fake story he made up to cover his real identity, since he's telling the story to the therapist in the end, it'd make sense because Joker always tell lies like when Ledger's joker said different stories about his scars.",POSITIVE
"Sep 9, 2023",This was the role of a lifetime for Joaquin Phoenix. The movie was very well done and it earned a great place in the Batman universe. I really liked how they touched on mental illness and how it impacts what the Joker does and who he is. I'm really looking forward to the sequel!,POSITIVE
"Sep 9, 2023","One of the best movies in the last 20 years, hands down!

Do you love hero pics? Do you like dark movies? Do you understand mental break downs? Do you love amazing acting? Can you watch a movie over and over again? Add this to your list then!

From start to finish, I was in. I didn't want to look away and miss a single thing.

I don't read the comics so I don't know the background of many of these stories, so when the story is told to me through an incredible cinematic experience, I'm asking for a second date!

"Sep 2, 2023","oscar is not enough for phoenix, he created and carried a masterpiece",POSITIVE
"Sep 1, 2023","It's hard to give an imperfect film 5 - stars but the Joker comes so close. What does it to take to be a supervillain, especially one who isn't motivated purely by money and power? Phoenix's Joker isn't an anarchist but a more of a niellist.  There's no Batman to give him purpose here, so instead his stand-in is a society, specifically capitalist society played by Thomas Wayne. What happens to the people at the bottom of this system? There's no one answer but some live with their families in an RV down my street, trying to make it as ""normal"" as they can for their kids. Others steal packages or cars off the same street, others steal so their families can eat. Ans once in a while someone comes along who has radically different views of the inherent laws and rule the system assumes (yet really only apply to these people new lower tiers).  The Joker is a period piece that sometimes looks like the not so distant future. As I walked out of the theater I wonder what freaks me out more: A person like Fleck, or the person who came out of the theater with no empathy for him.",POSITIVE
"Aug 30, 2023","Joker isn't the kind of character that's supposed to have his own movie, he's supposed to be mysterious and you can make up whatever backstory about him that you want because he's been represented so many ways in so many different formats that the options are limitless, so giving him his own movie and giving him HOLLYWOOD'S backstory ruins that and eliminates our imagination entirely, whilst at the same time attempting to be creative and new and imaginative! Yes, in Tim Burton's ""Batman"", we did learn about the joker and his backstory, which annoyed me, but at least it wasn't the prime focus of the entire film! It doesn't even HAVE a focus, because it's just a goofy-looking clown going evil! We don't want to see Joker go evil like we saw Darth Vader go evil, we want to see him be evil. Do evil. In this movie, all he does is BECOME evil. The idea of the Joker is that he IS evil! He doesn't develop his evil, he's just naturally evil and the rest, including his backstory, is up to us! I don't know if you'll agree, but I seriously despise this movie.",NEGATIVE

Rating: 9.5/10",POSITIVE
"Aug 20, 2023","Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal as an abused, mentally ill psychopath was chilling. The origin story was fantastic, although we have had a look at how Joker became the Joker in previous stories relating to Batman, this was a fun vision by the Director Todd  Philips and the Writers Todd Philips, Scott Silver and Bob Kane to bring this iconic DC character to the screen in a new adaptation was refreshing, fun and disturbing. The mark of Joker was definitely hit with this film. With a 2 hour and 2 minute runtime the pacing is fast and the story flows perfectly.",POSITIVE
"Aug 16, 2023","I would've rated this higher but I can't take bloody movies like this. Besides that, the movie was good and the actor was AMAZING. I wish I could rate it higher but no, the blood messes me up. Sorry. Especially the part where he kills the man with the scissors.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 6, 2023",I really want to see a Joker 2.,POSITIVE
"Aug 4, 2023",It had amazing acting but the plot is horrendous. Having a solo joker movie especially without Batman is pretty hard to make work and this movie just further proves that.  Despite this movie having the best acting I have ever seen in a movie the story is weak and a little boring.  This movie could have been a masterpiece with the actors they chose but it's not just acting that makes a movie good it's also how it is written. It is just too predictable.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Some movies are ahead of their time. 'Joker' may be the greatest movie to release behind its time. To start, 'Joker' is an almost perfect film if viewed in a vacuum. As far as a realistic story of how one of the most infamous villains ever put to page, the movie is incredible. Particularly influenced by Taxi Driver, 'Joker' thrives on portraying the (admittedly extreme) consequences of a society that undervalues the needed investment in the resources dedicated to the public's mental health. Unfortunately, 'Joker' released in the 'meme' era, and was ultimately subjected to both moral evisceration (some of which was fair), and extremist promotion (an instance of appropriation, a common enough tactic by such group). The acting is fantastic across the board, from Joaquin Phoenix' slowly unraveling Arthur Fleck, to De Niro's exploitative generic late-night show host, the on point acting makes the movie enthralling from start to finish. Controversial, brilliant, a casualty of the culture wars, Joker stands tall next to the other greatest comic book films like Logan and The Dark Knight.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","I've only had the chance to watch this like two or three times, but I did not expect to like the plot at all! I rarely watch DC films voluntarily for I am more of a Marvel girl, but Arthur's story was just too moving to ignore.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","JOKER is cinematic art at it's absolute finest. The direction by Todd Phillips is on point with gorgeous cinematography echoing the work of Darius Khondji in 'se7en' . Low camera angles and wide shots capture Gotham City as I've never seen it, whilst all the time focusing on its lead character. 
  And actor, Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the praise being lauded upon him. His slow burning transition from Arthur Fleck to the titular character is at times, uncomfortable viewing... but what else would we expect it to be?

  Is it fair to judge his performance next to Heath Ledger? Of course, fans and critics will do with every Joker incarnation, past, present and future. 
  But Arthur Fleck is Phoenix's character, and for the little time we view him as the Joker, Ledger fans won't be dissatisfied; it is almost a homage from Phoenix to the late actor and is an accomplishment of the highest standard.

  Does the film warrant it's UK rating of 15? Given the content of the themes explored, I would label the rating as being tame.
  This deserves an 18 restriction.
  The violence we see on screen is not glorified, but brutal and deservedly so. This isn't a movie directed for those easily concerned with social apathy or fears of anarchy. The tone of the film is unsettling and will leave a lasting expression on those who view it... and in closing, isn't that what we, as the audience, expect a movie to do?",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",Most brilliant character study since “Taxi Driver.” Phoenix deserved every award he received. He is the most talented actor of his generation. I feel as if he prepared for this particular role his entire life. River would have been so proud. ,POSITIVE

Me gusta mucho esta peli. Lo primero de todo, el Joker es un villano, loco y excéntrico cuyo propósito del personaje es tomarse la justicia con su propia mano mediante la ultraviolencia y el caos, por lo tanto no creo que nadie pueda tomar de ejemplo a seguir y yo creo que muchos lo estáis confundiendo.

"Jul 4, 2023","Haunting, psychological, realistic, and extremely well thought out. This is exactly what superhero movies in the modern era are aiming for, and often times missing. This one hits, and hits hard. When I first heard they were doing a Joker origin story I figured it would be terrible. Then, I saw the trailer and thought, ""okay, that looks interesting but I'll bet they crammed all the best parts into this 3 minute trailer and now the feature length film will be riddled with problems."" I was wrong. It's great all the way through.",POSITIVE

Rather than just being a comic book movie  this addressed more of the social issues people face everyday. And the way they tell his story is iconic. This is a movie that has a place in my heart. Joaquin Phoenix deserved the Oscar for movie nothing less. If he didn't win the Oscar after this movie i would have called oscar rigged.,POSITIVE
"Jun 16, 2023","This movie has some amazing themes and messages, and keeps you entertained and thinking throughout the movie. This is the kind of movie that you want to watch over and over again. In my opinion, this movie is the best rendition of the Joker ever (yes, ever).",POSITIVE
"Jun 16, 2023","joker is a masterpiece, the quintessential dc movie
violent, dramatic but a film that is very much to its own, it is entertaining due to its humor and a good way to follow the story but it is a humor that does not clash and it is not for what it shines or is taken very prominently in the film if not for a good script, performances and characters and as the movie progresses it gets stronger and you feel the story with legendary moments like the dance on the stairs.",POSITIVE

"Jun 3, 2023","Certainly a great movie, but the lack of quality films coming out over the past decade resulted in overrating and overreaction to Joker.

"May 30, 2023","An amazing charcater study of a character that we thought we knew, but indeed do not. Beautifully shot, edited and acted ESPECIALLY Joaquin Phoenix. His Oscar win was unquestionable. Todd Phillips knocked it out of the park with showing us how society can shape a monster out of those who need our help. You really do feel for Arthur and begin to understand why he is the way he his with still grappling the fact that he has become villainous Joker.",POSITIVE

"May 23, 2023","Spoiler Alert!! Full disclosure, I stopped watching at 37 minutes, I just couldn't take any more of the gloom, doom and hate. I thought this movie sucked. Maybe I saw a different movie from the one that everyone else saw, because I saw a film that was dark and depressing, had no one that I cared about and actually if they had all died, I wouldn't have cared. The city is disgusting, covered in graffiti, filled with hateful people who steal and attack at the drop of a hat, from street thugs to men in suits on the subway, no one seems to have any morality. If Batman is supposed to be controlling crime in Gotham, he is horrible at his job. I found no way to feel sorrow for the JOKER or anyone else in the movie. If anything, it proved to me that NOT living in the city, any city, was the best decision I ever made.",NEGATIVE

I still consider this movie really good, despite my less-serious look at it nowadays. It's a movie that feels very real, and has a lot of topics that hit home with me, due to how corruption runs through every part of my life.",POSITIVE

"Apr 22, 2023","A must-see for any and all Shark Tale fans. I believe this film may even be BASED off Shark Tale itself. I found the Joker to be VERY SIMILAR to Shark Tales protagonist, Oscar. Could this film secretly be the human version of Shark Tale? I think it could be. The parallels are undebatable. This film is the ULTIMATE inspiration for sigmas such as myself. When I see The Joker (or should i call him Oscar now?) I see a role model, someone to look up to. I hope i can see myself in them both one day. 
Yours faithfully,

"Apr 17, 2023","I know it's late but I have to write this. The movie itself is incredible. Phoenix does a phenomenal job on the joker. Second best behind heath ledger but you can't stop ledger now can you. The story being told from jokers lens when you really don't get any other lens and scenes made up in his mind that later make you go, ""oh that makes sense now"". Exploring the more sensitive and vulnerable side of the joker and giving him a more ""human"" approach was perfect. You can sympathize with him a lot of the time and feel bad for him with all he goes through. A great movie with almost perfect acting.",POSITIVE
"Apr 14, 2023","Esse filme é bem dramatico, mostrando um lado real do coringa, uma outra forma de ve-lo.

"Apr 11, 2023","The movie manages to capture the essence of the character in a way that no other adaptation has been able to do before. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker is absolutely outstanding, and it's clear that he put a lot of effort into bringing this iconic character to life. One of the things I appreciated about this movie was the way it explored the character's backstory. It was interesting to see how the Joker became the person he is, and how his experiences shaped his worldview. The film also does an excellent job of examining the societal issues that contributed to the Joker's descent into madness, making it a thought-provoking watch.",POSITIVE
"Apr 10, 2023","Sólo puedo decir que nunca había visto en el cine retratada de manera tan artera la enfermedad mental. Phoenix es extraordinario. Nunca pensé ver a mi hermano esquizofrénico retratado en el cine, con todo su dolor, su drama, su soledad, su anhelo. La vi en el cine y lloré profundamente. Al día siguiente, mi hermano había muerto. Tal vez deba verla otra vez, aunque me duela volver a ella.",POSITIVE

"Apr 9, 2023","This is a great film. Joker is dark and realistic, IMO it's the best DC film since the Dark Knight trilogy. Joaquin Phoenix transforms himself and gives a powerful performance that makes you feel terrified by him and sad for him at the same time, he really deserved that oscar. Robert De Niro also gives a great performance, the scene near the end of the film with him and Phoenix is very intense. If you haven't seen this yet give it a go! If you enjoy darker superhero films or thrillers, you should enjoy this.",POSITIVE
"Apr 9, 2023","Yo no era gran fan de ver las películas y series en idioma original, pero después de ver esta gran actuación me cambio la vida por completo.

"Apr 5, 2023","Ain't no way they did this to cocaine bear. I mean WHAT THE FUCK! Cocaine bear and 65 gave me hope that this franchise was finally on the right path but apparently NOT! Just because Joapin Phoenix played brother bear does not mean he has to ruin cocaine bear! This movie also wrecks the timeline by having it set in the 1970's, when 65 clearly set up that the franchise would happen long before humankind. And why, just why did they try to establish mark whalberg as Thomas Wayne, and cocaine bears FATHER?!!?! Not as bad as rocket man, but still one of the worst movies of all time",NEGATIVE

"Apr 5, 2023","The movie was good, but i feel it's using just Joker's name as reference. It has very little connection with actual character. In my opinion there shouldn't be any Joker related stuff for next 10+ years, it's just that Ledger did it so good it's irreplaceable in everyone's minds. Phoenix did a good job but it's just not that character, he plays someone else who tries to be Joker.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 4, 2023","Great movie, amazing origin story. Don't listen to the critics, they're wrong and biased. This movie is excellent and truly shows why Joker is the Joker or a version of him at least.",POSITIVE

"Mar 31, 2023","Six stars. How critics have the nerve to give less than 90%… The acting, plot and climactic build up should have propelled it to the best film Oscar. A film to break your heart as well as summon up anger. Truly prophetic",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2023","Just when you think you've seen as good an origin movie as you're ever likely to see, along comes this. Phoenix is mesmerising and acts the hell out of his role. It's a very different comic book adaptation that has more in common with Taxi Driver than the Batman franchise. It beautifully shows the disintegration of both the lead character and the broken society that in a sense created him. Powerful stuff.",POSITIVE

"Mar 21, 2023","A surprisingly well-acted and well-written story, Joker tells the tale of the origin of Batman's greatest nemesis. Joaquin Phoenix is an absolute force, balancing between completely unhinged and grounded simultaneously. His character's story is, obviously, central to the plot- but not in a way that one might expect. Instead of showing us the Joker's early days of crime, viewers are treated to the days even earlier than that when Arthur Fleck (the real name for the infamous villain) struggles with mental illness amid a world that couldn't care less whether he lived or died. And that's where Joker gets its real grit and nuance from- the idea that mental illness is something that can be, and should be, ignored. In its mythos Gotham, as a city, is protected by the Waynes, but the reality is much more bleak. Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) runs for Mayor amid his lavish excesses, a race that itself is lavish, while the underbelly of Gotham continues to swell which leads to Joker's thesis argument: That it's the rich and not the poor, downtrodden, and sick of Gotham that are in fact ruining the city. The one percent continues to party while the rest of us are left to rot with no consideration for what that might mean. These pieces set the scene for a more sympathetic and understandable Joker, one whose madness has reason. Phoenix is joined by the always-excellent Zazie Beetz as Sophie, Arthur's neighbor who is perfectly cast and whose story is perfectly paced. The only stumble in this otherwise excellent film is its need to try and shoehorn Bruce Wayne into the project, which it does towards the two-thirds mark. There really isn't any added quality with regard to childhood Bruce, and thankfully the scene doesn't overextend its already lukewarm welcome. Viewers know the universe that they're inhabiting, they don't need such an on-the-nose reminder. Joker still manages to be a force with a relatable angle for the most unrelatable villain in comic book history. Come for Joaquin Phoenix's triumphant performance, but stay for the surprisingly deep message at the core of this ""superhero"" film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 21, 2023","A dog getting kicked enough will eventually bite back. 

That is this movie in a nutshell. It portrays mental illness through multiple lenses, gives a thorough breakdown of the character's change, all while giving you feelings of both sympathy and disgust at the main character's actions. 

The score and cinematography are top-level that just adds to the overall disturbing atmosphere of this movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 20, 2023","The movie is perfect! It's dark, strong, painful to watch. We are able to see why joker is what he is!",POSITIVE
"Mar 19, 2023","Joachim is so good that he that he totally disappears into the character. The movie is overwhelming and totally unexpected in so many ways. The biggest surprise it's how it approachs mental health issues and how makes you want to support joker, fully understanding where his ""villain"" features are coming.

"Mar 14, 2023","Perfect in every aspect.

Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2023","Joker is a very hard movie to love. It is an incredible movie with outstanding elements but like many other great films, such as Whiplash, I'm not sure how inclined I'd be to watch it again. I am so glad I did watch it but due to the slow nature and how un-uplifting it is (I'm making that a word), I don't think I'd rush out to see it again. I am, however, looking forward to the sequel and any other follow-ups that may be made. I would definitely recommend it to fans of the character or of the Batman universe. If what I've talked about makes you interested in the film, then I would also certainly recommend it. However, I feel it is my duty to warn viewers of the very dark and gruesome moments.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2023",An amazing character study for the Joker and every performance is immaculate.,POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2023","Such a fun experiment for a comic book character. Todd Philips delivers with an amazing character journey.

Una actuación impresionante de Joaquín Phoenix de un personaje, patético y pusilánime que nada tiene que ver con el Príncipe payaso.

"Jan 17, 2023",This movie actually sucked so bad. I don't know why it got so much love. Prob because Joaquin Phoenix is the lead. A bunch of weird cringy joker laughs and a boring story with little to no action. The only decently cool part was the subway/train fight.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 11, 2023","A great movie when it comes to acting and understanding the personality of an already established caracter. As a honest representation of the Joker, Joaquin Phoenix does a job that's only comparable to Heath Ledger and his legendary interpretation in Dark Knight. Though the script could've had a better viewing on mental disorders, Todd Philips (well known for his comedy movies) and Scott Silver did and great job at putting their foot on the drama world and capturing the major points on depression and schizophrenia, despite being a little stereotypical. On the techinical side, filmography and sound design are very solid and overall add to the movie. A quality reimagining of an already known fictional world, Joker is not just another two hour time-waster like DC's well-known failures in the world of heroes, but a successful establishment of a new universe to be admired.",POSITIVE
"Jan 7, 2023","Um filme violento que trás um história interessante de como o coringa virou o coringa! Com um ator tão bom quanto Joaquin Phoenix, é óbvio que ele ganharia
um Oscar com essa obra de arte. Trilha sonora boa e calmante para um filme tão

"Jan 5, 2023","incredible, interesting twist on the origin of the joker without ignoring his pre existing qualities",POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2023","Basically, a Scorsese rip off where Phoenix clamors desperately for an Oscar for 2 hours. While the character of The Joker can certainly be done in an intriguing way, I think we've gotten to the point where clown characters compel gullible audiences to buy tickets. If the character of The Joker in this film was just Aurthor Fleck, and didn't wear clown makeup, well, it'd be kind of a skip-it affair, I think. But since he decides to wear clown makeup and call himself The Joker, and this is Gotham City, people clamor for it. I guess I just don't get the hype and don't feel that the film stands up on its own feet outside of the lore of the comics. I also find it kind of hard to swallow that this version of the Joker could become the criminal that takes on The Batman. This version was more straight up insane than insane and brilliant i.e., Ledger and Nicolson versions.  Overall, this is an extremely overrated affair and really quite boring.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 19, 2022","The explanation of mental instability due to the environment was such a crucial part that made this movie shed light on how many people out there could be fighting the same or close to issues in their lives. JOKER might have lost to his mental illness and led himself to where he ended in the movie, but to those out there, that battle you are going through will hopefully be won by you. The film says ""You Are NOT Alone"" in every language. Keep fighting, seek help, and perhaps one moment, this war will be off, and you will be better. Stay strong.

"Nov 26, 2022","The movie is a sort of psychoanalysis of this joker's mind, very well interpreted by Phoenix.
In fact we dive so deep into his consciousness that we are no longer able to distinguish whats real from what is not and almost like in a modern psychoanalytic book we can't really trust the protagonist's unstable perspective to determine the reality of the facts. The story is however very catchy and hearthbreaking, the sets are all nicely done and the concept of weaker joker, still in development of his character is something almost new. This movie certainly contains a subtle but undeniable criticism to modern society, especially towards the upper middle classes who sometimes feel superior towards the lower ones. The bad thing about this movie for me was that sometimes it made the character a bit too pathetic and insignificant but apart from that its brilliant",POSITIVE

"Nov 23, 2022","So gritty and often genuinely moving that when you are, occasionally, asked to suspend disbelief so that the ""comic book"" plot can advance itself it comes as a bit of a shock.  Tremendous performance from Joaquin Phoenix and Robert de Niro isn't half bad either.",POSITIVE

This is a very human take on the character and the fact that there are people out there with the same mindset as Arthur Fleck helps to make it more believable and human. This version of the character is not evil incarnate, though he does do pretty awful things you do understand where the desire and his mindset come from even if you don't agree with the actions he takes. The performance of Joaquin Pheonix is still honestly amazing and honestly if you don't care for the movie and its contents most can agree Joaquin Pheonix provided a beautiful performance.",POSITIVE

"Oct 25, 2022",Joker was a good character study movie.   Joaquin Phoenix gave it his all.   The main problem (but not really a problem because that's what it seemed they were going for) was that it drug out like a 1970's drama.   I mean that as a good and bad thing.   70's dramas were big on character development but the second act always seemed like they drug on.   That was this movie.  You had a lot of character development and you felt his pain as he went through the movie but the second act seemed like it went forever.   I would still say go see it.,POSITIVE

"Oct 22, 2022","This didn't have anything to do with any character you might be familiar with called ""Joker"". Joaquin Phoenix has a good performance as a mentally ill street performer. Some people used to seeing the usual comic book fare were perhaps tricked into seeing a mature, well-done film, hence the critic-audience discrepancy on scoring. Critics understand it's pretty run-of-the-mill, but people not used to such films, it must have seemed ground-breaking.

"Oct 18, 2022","The combination of Phoenix plus storyline re-imagined are what really make this special. A 'superhero' movie that feels compelling and real for once, like stepping into a dark 70's time capsule of history.

My only gripe is I wish it was longer or a mini-series.",POSITIVE

"Oct 8, 2022","This interpretation of the joker is pretty impressive, the story Brings a strong continuity, great characters and a strong concept. Although it does flatline in certain scenes, consider it minor traffic on a highway, the film holds strong, personally I felt that I could have been more true to the original Jokers lore, where he was dubbed the king of crimes, this pivotal role however falls on Joaquin's Joker as a form of conceptual fate, more so not as manic as the original. Lastly, there was so much more that could have made the film better, the artistic dancing and self face-downs could have taken a seat on the bench, it almost makes it as a completely brand new never before imagined Joker, which I though was refreshing to say the least, there's only one problem, it was never broken in the first place.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 5, 2022","Director Tim Miller manages to intrigue us with the much different comic-book centered movie, way different than the funny, self-centered and violent film Deadpool in 2016. By being darker, more serious and more self-reflected, Joker manges to be an entertaining comic-book inspired drama while being different altogether. The direction is great, the themes are fabolous, the violent is real and the performance by Joaquin Phoenix is amongst the best of the year as well as his best performance to date. The writing is a bit off at times and the movie's first half is slow, but its second half makes that first half go into your backbone",NEUTRAL

"Sep 29, 2022",Fantastic story telling and characters,POSITIVE
"Sep 28, 2022","There's no denying Joker's strengths: Todd Phillips' gritty 1980s New York City is immersive, and Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of a creepy loner turned maniacal clown is perhaps a career best for him.  That said, it's hard to tell what the point of this movie is.  It goes to pains to show that an uncaring and judgmental society will let down its vulnerable members, risking turning them into monsters.  Yet the tone feels intent on elevating the Joker to some sort of hero or role model -- never mind the fact that he's a violent and unstable murderer, someone ready to drag society down into chaos rather than put in the work to fix its shortcomings.  One wonders if the legions of fanboys with Joker posters hanging on dorm walls will come away thinking the government should expand funding for mental health services, or maybe engage that sad loner on a bus in pleasant conversation, or if they'd rather just pump their fists at the idea of a madman making the world worse.  My bet is on the latter, and for that reason I struggle to find redeeming qualities in this film.",NEUTRAL

"Sep 24, 2022","Joker is not your typical comic book film. It is a deep, violent, gritty psychological character study delving into the mind of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who has only ever wanted to make people laugh, to bring colour and joy to the world, but who has been beaten down again and again until he can take no more, and his life takes a downward spiral when he lashes back at his attackers. I love this film This is one of those film that's performances will make the film or break it. The writing, whilst a little rocky in a few places, is still solid throughout, and when it shines, it _really_ shines. This film would not be the same without Joaquin Phoenix's electrifying performance as Arthur Fleck, absolutely outshining everything else in this movie. Phoenix really put his all into the role, to the point that he is no longer playing the Joker. He is the Joker. Phoenix can and does run through depressed, angry, relieved, happy all in a minute, with nothing more than inflections in his voice and his facial expressions. The little details make it all the better. Watch out for a scene I call, ""How about another joke, Murray?"". That scene is the definition of an Oscar worthy performance. The movie grips you from start to finish, it manages to take a man who kills without remorse and make you feel for him. This movie isn't trying to make you happy, to make you laugh, it wants to make you uncomfortable, scared, angry and it succeeds at all of these from beginning to end.  You will sit down and instantly feel uncomfortable. As the film progresses you will feel sympathetic for Arthur getting beaten down by everyone around him, you will leave feeling empty. This film perfectly embodies the famous quote,
""We all can go insane with just one bad day."" If you can handle violence and dark themes and are at all interested in this film, I recommend you trust your instincts and give it a watch as soon as possible. You will not regret it.",POSITIVE

"Sep 2, 2022",Es una joya. Me parece muy atinado que por primera vez dejarón de hacer a un Joker caricaturizado. Eso le dió más realismo al personaje,POSITIVE
"Sep 1, 2022","This is a brilliant character drama with a top performance from Joaquin Phoenix, although I am very aware of the criticisms its received and I do see how people could be concerned about it either/both glamorising bloody violence in general and also linking mental illness to physical violence. One of the main criticisms I felt is that while the characters background is looked at, I feel it leaves the viewers with far too many unanswered questions and its the enigma aspect that makes him someone to be so fearful of. It doesn't help people with mental illness to be seen, yet again, as people to be fearful of, people who must be unbalanced and ready to attack at a moments notice.

The feeling of uncertainty, of some form of impending sudden movement, is present throughout. Its certainly a gripping watch, its relatively tense and edgy too, as should be expected, of course. There's an operatic/choreographed flair type element to said characters public appearances, which appears to come naturally to the actor, Joaquin. Its a good film - quite atmospheric and engrossing. This isn't a film for youngish teenagers, its quite gritty and bleak, hence the 15 rating but thats perhaps to be expected(?).  Its much less a superhero film in the traditional sense but again thats perhaps to be expected. Its a film well worth seeing if you know what to expect, in which case then yes I would recommend it.",POSITIVE
"Sep 1, 2022",Overrated; this movie is more a statement on American culture than it is a compelling story. A rehash of Taxi Driver with an equally great performance delivered by Joaquin I got the impression that the film was trying to piggyback off the popularity of the Joker character without creating a compelling case. Would have been better as a standalone story not based on the Gotham universe. Great acting but poor writing.,NEGATIVE

"Aug 24, 2022","This is one of the absolute best DC movie I think that I have ever seen, the story is absolutely amazing, the way the Phoenix played Joker is absolutely heartbreaking.

"Aug 23, 2022",It was a very different take on Joker and one that deserves multiple watches. He without a doubt earned his Oscar for this role. I wish they'd do the whole DC universe like this cause it completely takes away any perception of a corny superhero movie and treats it with a level of respectful seriousness no superhero movie ever has attempted to do before.,POSITIVE
"Jul 1, 2020","Pheonix's portrayal of Joker is chilling precisely because he embellishes so little, and unlike Heath Ledger's unbelievably cunning and charismatic Joker, we are left to believe that a man (or many men) with the same thoughts and history as Arthur Fleck actually exist(s) in the real world. He's the opposite of a super-villain-- there's clearly nothing super about him. Moreover, the movie is not even about him, but the undeniably raw social conditions that produce him. Public spending cuts force Arthur to lose his therapy and medicine. He and others live in grinding poverty and constant anxiety. There are no social resources for them to turn to for help. It's a dark, cruel social condition we know today as capitalist realism. As we see, the only logical solution is revolution.",POSITIVE
"Jul 1, 2020","Pretty amazing cinematography and an incredible score, but Joaquin Phoenix was most definitely the star of the show, in one of the greatest performances this decade. I was disappointed in Todd Phillips directing, but the writing was pretty good, and overall, I recommend.",POSITIVE
"Jun 28, 2020","It's pretty good.  I'm not quite sure where the Joker goes from sympathetic to not in my mind, but it happens somewhat imperceptibly as the film goes by.  I enjoyed watching it, and am glad I did so.

"Jun 28, 2020","Joker Story: The origin tale of the Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) – one of the most iconic villains in comic book history.
Joker Review: Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) isn't happy with his life. He struggles to make money as a part-time clown while sharing a rundown apartment with his ailing mom (Frances Conroy). But Arthur lives in a city struck by hard times where a decent, honest living is difficult to come by. He also suffers from a condition that causes him to break into uncontrollable laughter. None of this stops Arthur from dreaming big. He aspires to be a stand-up comedian and attempts to write jokes in his diary. Caught in between it all, Arthur slowly begins to lose his grip on sanity.
It's immediately apparent that this is not your standard comic book fare. Todd Phillips painstakingly constructs the story of a man at his wit's end when pushed beyond his breaking point. Phillips doesn't glorify mental illness but instead makes a compelling case of a deeply disturbed individual struggling to find a coping mechanism in the form of an unhinged alter ego. This also resonates in his gritty vision of Gotham City, a metropolis brought to its knees, and crime is just a way of life. Only the rich and corrupt seem to be unaffected by the mayhem – a pertinent notion in present times. Set in the early 80's, this fictional city is reminiscent of that era with impeccable production and a time-relevant, yet unsettling soundtrack that evokes a constant sense of uneasiness.
Arthur Fleck's gradual descent into madness has a distant parallel to ‘Taxi Driver', also featuring Robert De Niro, so there's a sense of joy for the cinephile to see him here. But, none of the cast holds a candle to Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role, captured by a dedicated and immersive performance. Watching Phoenix disappear into character makes one fear the actor's sanity as he creates his own unique version of the villain. At first, his wiry, awkward frame stumbles to get from one place to the next, but when he eventually transforms, he becomes graceful, resembling an agile dancer. It's simultaneously difficult to watch and yet, impossible to take your eyes off him. If Joaquin Phoenix finally wins an Academy Award for this performance, it will be hard to argue against it. Disturbing and intense, yet undeniably brilliant, this may very well become the definitive origin tale of the Joker.",POSITIVE

"Jun 26, 2020",I can see why this movie got so many Oscar nominations. This is the type of movie that the Academy loves to nominate and reward. But this movie actually deserves it. Everything is done beautifully and is executed perfectly. The highlight of this movie is without a doubt Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck. 100% deserved the Oscar win. The other thing that really stood out to me in this movie was its music score. It matched the movie's tone perfectly and the way that it created tension in a scene was perfect. This movie may have its dark moments at times but it's definitely a piece art that deserves all of its praise.,POSITIVE

"Mar 1, 2020","I saw the (mostly negative) reviews in the big newspapers (NYT, WP, etc) and websites long ago when the movie came out, but I just rewatched it and just wanted to share my two cents. 

Joker has been wildly criticized. A common reason of criticism was the  claim that association between mental illness and violence sends the wrong message about both. 

Personally, I think we tend to overlook subtleties and jump to conclusions that are hard-and-fast, black and white. There's a difference between understanding the reasons behind a behavior and justifying it. Joker does a wonderful job at the former: we get the bigger picture, we see where he is coming from, and have light on the whys behind his actions. 

Yes, Joker does embody the dangerous result of a sick mind and an alienating society, as he says it so well just before killing Murray. His actions, atrocious as they are, do not invalidate this fact. 

Another point refers to the generalization of violent behavior. Obviously, not everyone who is mentally ill is a potential murderer, but everyone who is mentally ill in a society that does not offer support is extra vulnerable to becoming violent, if the wrong combinations are at play. What is art if not a portrait of real life? So the movie does a great job bringing the issue up. 

Again, it is not about justifying  Joker's actions. It's  about understanding and empathizing with the history, but not the action. It's about understanding and about NOT condoning the behavior. I got out of it with so many insights, but I believe these can be lost in the fleeting moment critics fall prey to their own knee-jerk reactions to violence and biases. Joker's actions are understandable given his circumstances, but that doesn't mean they are justified and I think that's the point the movie tried to make. 

I appreciated the acting, the soundtrack and the overall development of the character, ever so slowly but surely, into the maniac. 

Phoenix definitely deserved the Oscar.",POSITIVE

"Feb 29, 2020","Oh god, the Joker. What a masterclass in filmmaking, mood, acting, the dance of the camera, the play of colours and textures and gripping music. Todd Phillips has created something so powerful, so compelling that you can't help at marvel at it as a piece of cinema. Of course this is Joaquin Phoenix's moment of glory, like all his previous acting roles weren't already right up there with the best on screen performances, here he takes it up another notch, maybe to the top notch. The pain and trouble behind his eyes can only be awed at.

I found myself not wanting this film to end, I love the way we intimately see his journey and every incident and knock back, every heart wrenching glimpse of sadness of this tormented soul stoking the fire of not only his demise but also his rise. He made us feel a release through the imagery of killing his own mother, he allowed us in to his hopelessly lost mind where a different kind of sense actually made sense. Phoenix had me glued to the screen, I didn't even want to miss any it to go to the toilet.

There was so much to love about the production design, the bleakness of it, the hardness of it and the use of lighting to give a grade to the film as opposed to it being graded and colour washed heavily after the fact. Really nice use of CGI to augment the city scenes and make it dank and dystopian. The quant mix of old and new technology to create a parallel but alternate universe. None of this seemed out of place, it all went into creating a seamless whole and the viewer was totally sucked into this world and bought into it without question despite the quirkiness and asynchronous nature, no doubt adding to the overall feel of uneasiness and tension.

I think you either get this film or you don't. The message here was clearly one of mental health and not only the health of an individual but the health of a nation as a result of the attitude to the central theme. The slow boiling of the main character with no let up or relapse, just a continual build of tension throughout the piece, leaving you unsure of what could happen next and who was at risk around Fleck as he proceeded to his climatic scene where he finally found his audience, the one he'd been craving his whole life. The crushing sense of defeat too as he went about his daily life added even more and piled on the immense sense of dread and sadness felt by Fleck. The maintenance and the slow build of this film is where the masterful direction of Phillips is so apparent. Forget the politics, this was a huge billboard of a message, shining the light and showing the plight of those who suffer from mental illness no matter how big or small.

The cinematography, man, I couldn't tell you much about it other than it was flawless and unnoticeable - in the best way. There were some lovely scenes that really took your breath but most of the time it just supported the story and that's the most you can ask of your photographer - to assist and add to the story telling and not to detract from it. The sense of darkness and dread I felt were perfectly married with the lighting and mood of the piece. For a tale that was originally a comic book storyline featuring gaudy characters who never really had much character, this shows you what can be achieved in the right hands from such an almost insignificant starting point of reference. Sure, Heath Ledger did a brilliantly good job in the Nolan reboot, but for me, Phoenix wiped the floor with Ledgers performance and elevated it to the stratosphere in The Joker. It takes a special team of people to pull off such a great film and I can't wait to see what these guys get up to next. I hate sequels but I'd love to see more of this story.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2020","The Joker movie is a 2019 year psychological thriller. The film is an origin story for Batman's greatest nemesis, starring Joaquin Phoenix as a man called Arthur Fleck, who struggles with the weight of his mental illness and a miserable existence. Inside the misunderstood man lives a sadistic and psychopathic murderer. Eventually, he have been pushed too far, and he transforms himself into the Joker who begins to take revenge on the world. 
	Phoenix is really into his character's insanity and it causes the viewer to be anxious in many different ways, because Arthur is often such a scary person. At the same time it is strangely funny that viewer also understands and even feels sorry for him for some reason. Arthur has been mistreated by the world all of his life and as a viewer might be startled when totally realizes why he becomes the Clown Prince of Gotham. A fantastic addition to this movie is the illness that Arthur's have, which makes him laugh recklessly, even though he doesn't want to. Phoenix may instantly start to howl when he laughs and also all the smile might suddenly just disappear off his face. He is scary but at the same time really sympathetic. The farther the movie goes, the bigger Phoenix gets to tear up and enjoy his role.

The movie is a realistic story about a man who is plunged into deep darkness, mental illness and for everything what these kinds of problems might cause. Although the Joker is often perceived as a smiling and hilarious character, he can not really be called hilarious in his own movie. This is a truly distressing and heartbreaking piece with a slight sense of humor. The movie mercilessly takes its viewer inside Arthur's mind, which is plagued by many things. The character's journey from a boy who takes care of his mother to an iconic criminal is an extremely captivating in all its horror. The film is oddly fascinating and Arthur's sudden dances might go into hypnotism even though they are very confusing and weird. This is one of the best cartoon animations of all time perhaps because it never feels like it and overall, it is an incredibly great movie.",POSITIVE
"Feb 29, 2020",AMAZING!! Phoenix is phenomenal which makes up for the lack of supporting cast members. The score and cinematography are excellent.

"Feb 10, 2020","This is one of the most incredible pieces of cinema that has graced the screen in years. This is a proper arthouse film that blends craftsmanship with source material. While it is supposedly a one-shot take on the Clown Prince of Crime, it does not ignore the source material to the extent that it is a whole new character, i.e. Will Smith as Deadshot -- Will Smith playing anyone is still Will Smith playing Will Smith playing [said character].

JOKER finds a balance between the creative ideas for the character and the character's long-winded history. This is a film worth seeing, if not for the empowerment of low-budget cinema, for the way Joaquin Phoenix inhabits his space. He becomes the character in simple ways, embracing everything about the broken man society forgot.",POSITIVE
"Feb 10, 2020","Exploring the origin of Joker but it has nothing like in a comic. The film introduces us to a poor guy that has been suffering from his mental illness and is likely to grow worse as time pass, I had prepared that a film will not involve any action scene as we thought that Joker would somehow interact with the famous character like Batman. It is different, It's a stand-alone movie.",POSITIVE

"Jan 17, 2020","Let's start by saying that I did enjoy the movie.  It's a good film, entertaining.  But the hype made me expect more and that just wasn't there.  I'm not in agreement with Dan Kois at Slate who dismisses the movie as ""stupid"".  There are moments that stretch the line of credulity, but no more so than any other superhero film.  My complaints about the movie center on two main things; plot development and character veracity.  
As to plot, the movie creates a sense of impending doom without ever delivering on the doom.  Knowing that the character would eventually become the mass-murdering ""Clown Prince of Crime"" is supposed to infuse all of the main character's actions with import.  What the movie doesn't do is build to an inevitable crescendo that resolves itself in tragedy.  In this way the movie is less horrific than it ought to be.  Horror is best when the end product is the result of one action or choice after another - building to an inevitable conclusion.  But in ""Joker"" there is no inevitability, no lie the character believes, no inciting moment, no complication and development, no buildup of tension leading to an inevitable peak.  Act I is the same as Act II which is the same as Act III in this movie b/c there really is no progress, or attempt to avoid the inevitable, or gradual discovery of the awfulness, or repetition of symbolic metaphors.  There is one big mother of a temper tantrum on live tv which results in some redecorating of the walls of the set but there is no real climax to the story.  In terms of plot, therefore, it's more like watching snow fall off a roof or watching paint dry or watching a pancake slide down a wall; you know it will and when it does... meh.  
In terms of character I have two main disagreements.  
First is an implausibility to the Arthur Fleck character - the guy is a total sad sack whose eventual ""transformation"" into the Joker is more like one more sucky thing happening to him than it is a moment of horrific inevitability.  It is hard to accept that one person would have so many bad things happen to him; abusive adoptive mother, crappy apartment, loser talents, dead end job, miserable gritty town, hostile and antagonistic neighbors, lousy boss, health issues, bad looks - yeah, your life sucks, dude.  But oddly, even when people seem to have lousy lives they still have humor, friends, moments of joy, insight, access to art or poetry or song or booze - which make life bearable.  Why didn't Fleck have any of this?  Alright, so he's a loser with the ladies, but couldn't he have made a pass at that cute social worker, or maybe struck up a conversation with the gal on the subway after he killed those three dudes?  or learned to play the guitar on the street like John Lee Hooker?  or get drunk at the local with other losers?  Something!  Anything!  It's as though the writers didn't know what normal humans actually do with their run-down lives.  Normal humans eat junk food and get diabetes; binge watch ""Game of Thrones"" on Netflix; play pool or checkers or Pacman at the local arcade - Something!  Anything! besides washing their Grendelian mother every night.  The character just seems unbelievable.  Indeed, against a hostile world human beings have a startling resilience which takes the most amazing forms; learning to polka dance at the Czech club - collecting spores, molds and fungus - becoming the leading expert on ""Doc Savage"" comics.  Something!  Anything!  Resistance is not futile!  

Second, Aristotle had it right when he said that horror or tragedy in a character is always strongest when it is the result of the character's own choices & actions.  To choose evil, or even to choose without understanding and thus make a fatal mistake leading to inevitable ruin, is more horrible than simply being the patsy for a violent world.  In ""Joker"" the maniac is created by a hostile world abusing a poor demented victim.  Arthur Fleck even says this when talking to Murray Franklin (DeNiro)
What do you get...when you cross...a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?  You get what you ******' deserve!
This is too simplistic an equation, I think.  It is as if to say that ""society"" is to blame – rather than individuals who are evil or good.  Fleck is just ""mad as hell and not going to take it anymore!"" More to the point is that in terms of art the character is not so horrific because he never CHOOSES to be a monster.  The truly horrific human monsters in literature and in life such as Grendel, Macbeth, Patrick Bateman, Niander Wallace, or John Gacey, Jeffrey Dahmer, Pol Pot, Che Guevara – all choose the role of monster.  Perhaps they justify their actions or perhaps they had horrible things done to them, but their choice remained their own.  The Swansea conference, or the treatments of the kulaks by Stalin, or the flaying of young coeds, or Idi Amin's cannibalistic devouring of his enemies, abuse, child-molestation, random school shootings, slát unwearnum / bát bánlocan / blód édrum dranc / synsnaédum swealh – these are the horrific monsters of human society and all are the result of choice, not mere accident.  As an audience we do not find horror only in the violence they perpetrate but in the CHOICE to commit such violence.  Our horror stems from the knowledge that perhaps we too might make a similar choice.  It would not be so pungent were these events mere accidents of nature, or if they were perpetrated by some unthinking beast.  It is, rather, the willed malice that causes horror to rise in us like some cold Lovecraftian behemoth.  
But Fleck's simpering victimhood doesn't inspire such horror.  He is a pitiable character with his expressions of ""I just hope my death make more cents than my life"" (poor blighter can't even spell right) and his Hitchcockian mother complex (""She always tells me to smile, and put on a happy face"" = pathetic) but he is a victim – a sad skinny puppy cowering in the rain.  Even his name is little more than a fleck even though he is supposed to be Arthurian in his greatness.  When he kills his victims there is even an invitation to rejoice as each one is a bully, a jerk, an abuser deserving of some justice.  In the final murder of Murray Franklin (in an obvious homage to the Frank Miller scene) I had to stifle a little cheer as it seemed so appropriate.  More horror exists in seeing Oedipus come out on stage with his bleeding eyeballs, or watching Sweeney Todd (Len Cariou) suddenly discover who the beggar woman is whom he has just murdered, or watching Bull McCabe (Richard Harris) drive his son over the cliff with the cattle. When Fleck has his final apotheosis on the police car amidst cheering crowds of clown-masked adorers there is little to cheer or be horrified by – it's just… meh.  
In conclusion, I would recommend this movie.  It is a worthy addition to the Batman lore.  Certainly Joaquin Phoenix gives a performance which, though never building in intensity, definitely is deserving of consideration.  The music and camera work are both quite good and there is something of merit in seeing what the movie has to say.  But overall, were I to choose it again, I might enjoy watching pancakes slide down the wall instead.",NEUTRAL

With some downsides being that it copies other movies beat for beat like the king of comedy is a big comparison other than that a good movie.,POSITIVE
"Jan 17, 2020","I think the best Joker is the Killing Joke (comic) version, however this is a good adaptation and modernization of the Joker. One of fundamental problems I have with this film is that they are making the Joker more of an anti-hero instead of a full villain. Yeah it's important to be have a human background, but I want to see himself killing innocent people not just people who offended Joker feelings. The best Joker comes from the Killing Joke knows that life is a joke, and that anyone who goes through that ""1 bad day"" will become crazy like the Joker and the Batman... and that life is completely pointless... so it doesn't matter who dies or not, because all life is a joke to him. I think Batman part of the story was really weak, which is also a disappointment because Joker in a weird love relationship with the Batman in this books, so it's disappoint they Batman didn't push the ""Joker"" in the acid pit, and that Joker isn't obsessive with the Batman.... 

I hope if they do a sequel to this Joker movie, they had all the above element stories to the Joker, and they lose the ""anti-hero"" touch or else they screw up the character like they did to our beloved Vemon in the comic books. Where Vemon was a full on villain, and slowly though the years, they turned him into a ""greyish type of hero""...sometimes doing the bad thing, but usually working with regular superheroes like ""it no problem"". Carnage was actually made because of Vemon changing into a hero, and Carnage was also based on the old version Vemon and Joker.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 17, 2020","SPOILER WARNING!
Pros: I like how the villain is the protagonist and instead of hating him you feel bad for him. You feel bad for Joker right away when he is just holding up a sign and gets jumped and the sign was destroyed. You feel even more bad for him when he gets fired by his boss because he gets blamed for breaking a sign. So Randal buys a gun but this gun is very important to the movie and I like it. The thing I like even more about this movie is that you see Joker as a good guy at the start of the movie but by the end of it he is a villain. So he has a dream where he is on a tv show and he is on Murray's tv show. So in a bar Arthur makes some jokes that nobody laughs at so later in the movie Murray makes fun of him. So he meets a girl but so you thought he met this girl because this girl was all in his head. So when Arthur(Joker) gets a second job as a clown for a children's hospital he brings a gun but it falls out f his coat so he gets fired and you continue to feel bad for him. So when he is on the bus he is laughing because of a condition he has that makes him laugh randomly and he does. So the three guys on the bus make fun of him and start to beat him up the same way those kids beat him at the start of the movie. So he shoots his gun and kills one of them but instead of making him unlikable you feel bad for him and root for him.  So you want Arthur to kill those three guys and he does and it is used eventually to start a movement. Eventually, Thomas Wayne is crying about their deaths on tv. The movie picks up when you realize the girlfriend was all in his imagination and his dad could be Thomas Wayne. I like the scene where Arthur visits the Wayne mansion and talk to Bruce Wayne. I also really like the part where Thomas Wayne and Arthur are in the bathroom and Thomas Wayne is mad because Joker touch Bruce's cheeks so he punches Arthur and you feel bad for him. When you figure out all the lies Arthur's mom told him that's when you feel really bad for him because his mother said that the condition that makes him laugh is made up. So Arthur kills his mom but you still don't hate him. After he puts on makeup and gets a costume and becomes Joker and that is when I got really excited. When David and Randal go to Arthur's house to check on him he killed Randal. So, later on, He dances down a staircase and you like it and can get into his vibe. So he is getting chased by cops but he gets a mask. So he eventually meets Murray and he gets to be on a tv show but he wants to be introduced as Joker. When he is on tv it is incredible. I won't go into too much detail but he makes some good pointers on how he thinks society is wrong and in a way you can see where he is coming from and in a way you can see how his actions are wrong. So he kills Murray and gets arrested but his movement has start and one of the people inspired by this movement kills Thomas and Martha Wayne. So Joker gets arrested and has me thinking that there could be a sequel and I really hope they make a sequel. The great thing about this movie is that the more you think about it the better it gets and the more you like it.

Cons: The movie is very similar to Taxi Driver and you could make this exact movie about a different character and it would still feel the same because this movie doesn't really feel like a Joker movie.

Overall I am really happy that Joaquin Pheonix won an Oscar from this movie and I think he 100% deserves it. I'm gonna give Joker an (A)",POSITIVE
"Jan 17, 2020","Watched The Joker last night and what a crazy trippy ride it was, to be expected of course! Joaquin Phoenix is ""The Joker"" I'm convinced! He played the role so perfectly it's as if I didn't even see Joaquin Phoenix, I saw the Joker! It took me so long to fall asleep after watching, it was brutal and heart wrenching but at the same time I couldn't get over the cinematography and how this tragic film could be made so beautifully! Every scene was a piece of art, carefully framed to perfection which was contrast to Jokers erratic behavior but so well balanced, the lighting, placement, positioning, timing etc, the music fit the emotions I felt throughout. I haven't seen a film I could barely watch yet love at the same time for it's all around brilliance! I feel messed up, touched and inspired all at once!",POSITIVE

"Jan 11, 2020","I'll admit, this was a boring 6/10 or so on my first viewing. But a lot of people suggested watching it again, and it's a solid 9.8/10. Where do I begin? The acting and characters were phenomenal, the writing is airtight, and it tells a believable and compelling story about a man's descent into madness, with messages and themes about how we need to care about and look after people who are mentally ill or disadvantaged. The shots and cinematography are great, the music score and its use are great. A lot of people are complaining that it makes them feel uncomfortable, but that's kind of the point - it's a look into a disturbing life of a man with a mental illness.",POSITIVE
"Jan 11, 2020","Todd Phillips directed this box office hit, based on Bob Kane's DC comics character, creating an origin story around Batman's arch nemesis. Set in early 1980s Gotham, overrun by crime where the streets are littered with garbage, a street clown, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), fantasizes about being a stand-up comedian and appearing on television with his favorite talk show host (Robert De Niro). When his dreams fail, he experiences hallucinations which leads to an outbreak of violence that inspires a countercultural revolution against the wealthy Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) in Gotham. This is essentially a Batman movie as if conceived by Scorsese but without the psychological depth or social commentary. Casting De Niro in the movie only makes the comparisons to ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"" even more obvious.  What's most disturbing is that the movie projects an overall feeling of nihilism. Joaquin Phoenix shows, once again, why he is one of the most original and daring of American actors. He takes on one of the most iconic roles and gives it new dimensions. His uncontrollable fits of laughter are indelible. Won Oscars for Best Actor (Joaquin Phoenix) and Original Score. Written by Todd Phillips and Scott Silver. Cinematography is by Lawrence Sher. Music is by Hildur Guonadottir. With Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Shea Whigham, and Bill Camp.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 11, 2020","disturbing, overdone, vague, a torture session to watch. couldn't wait for it to be over. Phoenix is mesmerizing at points, but you have to suffer through a lot of overdone drama,  cackling laughing, and the ridiculous notion that everyone punches this guy in the face,  to appreciate it...hated it.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 11, 2020","The movie was dark and gritty. Joaquin Phoenix played an excellent Joker, one of the best renditions of Joker in any movie and I would love to see a second movie that would tie in with Heath Ledger's portrayal. I give it a 5 out of 5 stars.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019","Watch Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, and Network for the same effect",NEGATIVE
"Dec 21, 2019",It's an extremely disturbing look at a mentally insane person lose what little they have.,POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019",A brilliant movie in every way conceivable and imaginable... Great to watch and leaves an even greater aftertaste; much food for thought...,POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019","A wonderful performance from Joaquin, which left me feeling empathy for the joker, despite the terrible things he did.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019","Arthur's lack of validation by any other human drives him into a corner where he begins making violent decisions without remorse. Very depressing, nihilistic and quite dark. The atmosphere and music becomes unbearable in a beautiful way. There is very little release of tension throughout the movie, which provoked me to feel relief when violence finally occurs. 

The story is much more focused on classism and inequality than I initially expected due to it mostly being discussed as a representation of mental illness. In my opinion, it manages to simultaneously be both a passable and also hugely inaccurate representation of mental illness. By that I mean Arthur's symptoms of anxiety and his dysfunctional coping mechanisms were somewhat realistic (particularly his shaking, as well as the odd and intrusive nature of his daydreams, which took the form of supportive and loving figures for self-validation). However, his violence is not really due to mental illness or delusion. Rather, it is as a result of his philosophical choices and worldview. 

It left me feeling awful. Because it left me feeling, and I felt its impact ringing in my head for the following days, I rate it highly. Relatively validating, not encouraging. Don't watch when you're feeling down, unless you're okay with feeling worse afterwards.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019",The best comic book adaption of all time. Better than V for Vendetta.,POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019","Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic in his role as the iconic character. Possibly a career best for
Phoenix. The amount of talent behind the crafting in this movie truly elevates this movie above the rest of the DC movies. Time will tell if this movie still remains relevant in the years to come.",POSITIVE

"Dec 21, 2019",It's a good history with a great performance. And that's it. No more than that,NEUTRAL
"Dec 21, 2019","Reminiscent of a Scorsese film, this psychological thriller does not feel at all like a comic book movie. Many say that Joaquin Phoenix topped Heath Ledgers' Joker. I would not agree because Joaquin Phoenix does something arguably even harder to pull off- he does a great pre-joker; A great Joker back story. The film is more about a potential origin story for the joker and that is something that would be very hard to do right because the joker is already immortalized as the perfect villain. Creating an origin story could ruin the magic and marvel to the joker, but this film adds to it. Instead of merely explaining where the joker came from, like every other comic book superhero movie has done, this film is only giving you a possible idea of what might have happened. It is absolutely true to the essence of the modern joker, and his performance is intimidating, and in the best of ways. Exactly the temperance you'd expect from the Joker in his youth were you to encounter him on the street. There is also some profound commentary on the state of American society that I did not expect from this film, and it made it go above and beyond. The cinematography and side characters are also appropriately grim and dismally comical. I understand why people wouldn't like it because I understand why people don't like the Joker character or these kind of challenging movies, but I say its a masterpiece and a must-see.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019",o my god it's awesome!,POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019","One of the best movies ever made, up there with the greatest of all time.
Never seen a better performance from a actor. Just has to win a oscar or two for this, Joaquin phenix, his brother was pretty talented too... just WHAT a movie this is, a must watch for anyone my god this is what you call a movie, and why they are made.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019",absolutely on my top ten,POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019",Very repetitive and forceful. I felt the film was trying too hard to make me feel empathetic/sympathetic. Decent ending though and Phoenix does a good job.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 21, 2019","i really loved it! the music, the color in the scenes and the best of all the performance of the main character!",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019","One of those movies you can't just get it out of your head. It has its flaws yes, but it was overall great movie.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019","A bit uneven which is probably why you see a wide range of reviews.

The first 45 minutes or so are almost kind of boring but then it kicks into high gear and pays off the setup of the first hour.

Phoenix is great both as Arthur, and Joker. I had some issues with his Joker though. Not how he portrayed him, like I said he was great, but there are some personality traits he embraces as the Joker that he showed no hint of as Arthur. It's like he became an entirely different character for the last party of the movie. That character was great, but it wasn't consistent with what had led up to it.


For me personally, I still prefer Heath Ledger's Joker, though Phoenix's might be a close second. Like Ledger's, you find yourself at times wondering if that's the same actor behind the paint. I just prefer Ledger's ""Agent of Chaos"" Joker to Phoenix's portrayal which I can't even give a good definition to yet. ""Insanely Sane""?

Phoenix will definitely be nominated for the role.",POSITIVE

"Dec 18, 2019","This movie has pretty much no need to exist. It adds nothing to the character and doesn't really feel like it suits the character.

Phoenix's performance is the only memorable thing.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 18, 2019","For a while watching this it was hard to place because it did not have the feel of Gotham City.

However, Joaquin Phoenix alone makes up for a lot of the pieces that I felt were missing. He was marvelous.",POSITIVE

"Dec 18, 2019","yeah, for me it really was unimpressive. It's like you could see them to win an award by being ""edgy."" It fell short of all the acclaim and praise I've been hearing. It oversimplifies mental health in my opinion.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019","A brilliant and new portrayal of one of the most iconic comic book villains of all time!
Once again, critics lied to you. Or they were at least dis-honest about why they disliked the film. It's a real shame they do not see how irresponsible they are by bashing a movie based solely on 'perceived' political messages. 
If Joker has any political messages, it's a very liberal one. Which make's me wonder why the major media outlets all stood against it?
I have a feeling, it has to do with the movie theater shooting a few years back when the Dark Knight was released. Maybe that's it. Who knows. All I know is this was one of the best films of the year hands down. And Phoneix deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance.",POSITIVE

"Nov 9, 2019","An amazing film by Todd Phillips with a brilliant performance from Joaquin Phoenix.  This version of Gotham is the most realistic I've ever seen and it gives all of the events a real punch that would otherwise be lacking in a standard comic book screen adaptation.  Anyone who says this film glorifies violence obviously hasn't actually watched it.  Either that or they have a political agenda forcing them to trash the film.  Now, don't get me wrong; the movie is NOT flawless.  There are a few rough edges with some of the supporting characters and the ending feels somewhat rushed compared to the slow burn of the first hour.  But the actors' performances more than made up for those minor quibbles and I highly recommend this film as one of the best comic book adaptations ever made.  This is what Black Panther aspired to be despite it actually turning out to be nothing but a bog-standard superhero film clone of Iron Man, Ant-Man, etc.  All of the unearned attention and plaudits awarded to Black Panther should have gone to Joker instead.",POSITIVE

"Nov 5, 2019",I loved it. Jaqouin Phoenix was phenomenal. Best joker yet. Can't wait for the sequel.,POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2019",More violent than I thought it would be. But the actor did a great job of portraying the character going mad.,POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2019","I liked it, and I am ready for part two. Joaquin was perfect for this part, absolutely phenomenal! No one else could have played the part like he did. I was uncomfortable the entire time! I just thought it was a tad bit slow for the first hour or so, but maybe it was necessary...",POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2019",The epitome of beating a dead horse.,NEGATIVE
"Nov 5, 2019",Good story but its a bit slow paced. I DO like the detailed information about how Aurthor became the Joker as well as adding in Bruce Wayne to the movie.,POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2019","Too dark, realistic violence not entertaining. Minimal plot.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 4, 2019","It is an Once in a lifetime role for Joaquin Phoenix but in few instances it seemed forced or rehearsed. I thought it needed another character with slightly more brighter life to bring in more contrast in the main character - to pronounce the effect of ignorance, neglect, abuse, and loneliness. Not everybody is clown and not all clowns are like Joker. Yes the plot is how he became like this but I thought there is room for more improvement so that it moves us more. Some of the shots with or without people are memorable. ",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2019","This is probably the first time I feel the urge to write a review on a movie because I was truly disappointed by the feedback that it had received. With the movie fresh on my mind, I can easily say that I was beyond astonished by its captivating plot that kept me on the edge of my seat as I observed the ticking time bomb that was Arthur Fleck. Of course, such a plot could only be executed by a star like Joaquin who could make a character originating from a comic book actually seem like someone we ignorantly pass by in the streets on a daily basis. Yet I could see why this movie would fail to impress a more superficial crowd as it is only the pained who can truly understand art, which is why Arthur slams himself into the cold metal of the cage that is the society he lives in so he can feel more pain until he understands more of the ""art"" around him (though in his own uniquely unnerving manner). All in all, I believe the Joker opens your eyes to how confidence can be achieved by wearing red, but not always in the way that you'd think, glorified or not.",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2019",It was disturbing and dark. A movie I would only watch once.,NEGATIVE
"Nov 4, 2019",I love the story behind the making of the “joker”,POSITIVE

"Nov 4, 2019",best comic book character origin story ever made.,POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2019","I actually enjoyed it!  It was not an action movie, so if that is what your looking for you wont find much within this movie however the end does have a bit. It was a sad story but really did a nice job laying out background of Arthurs life and I could see a sequel in the making!  Still so much to tell.",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2019","very good, could have been longer but maybe there will be a sequel. the ending was perfect. not an all time great movie but I was very please to see they dont sugar coat anything and make the character complexe",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2019","Great movie, the acting was amazing!  I highly reccomend it!",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2019",The movie made it so we now know why the Joker was so weird. It was powerful!,NEUTRAL
"Nov 4, 2019",it made joker more realistic. it shows how mental illness without help can get worse without help.,POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2019","I hate movies where you can predict the next scene or outcome. This wasnt one of those. I also like the serious theme that DC movies strive for, but has failed to successfully deliver consistently. The greatness of this film makes it all the more insulting that Justice League is associated via the same franchise. Phoenix did an excellent job remaking Joker. Ledgers was my favorite, but this may be a 1A vs a close 2nd.",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2019",Better than i expected. Kudos to Joaquin Phoenix on a classic portrayal of a maniac clown,POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2019",We liked the main character. He really played his character well. It was a bit dark but my boyfriend loved it and said it could of been a bit darker.,POSITIVE

"Nov 4, 2019",very twisted in the views of mental illnesses,POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2019","no real story line. just a sick man and his demise. the acting is good, but Joaquin probably isn't even acting.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 3, 2019",He will probably win the Oscar.  It was pretty boring and all he did was laugh constantly.  Which annoyed me.  I really would like to have my 2 hours of my life back.   My friend was crying at the end and loved it.  My husband didnt like it at all.,NEUTRAL

"Nov 3, 2019","Very disturbing story. Joaquin Phoenix is unbelievable, though it’s difficult to watch. Amazing performance by Phoenix.",POSITIVE
"Nov 3, 2019","A riveting art house take on Batman’s greatest villain, without the Batman.  Joaquin Phoenix immerses himself completely and has you worried for him as an actor while you worry about his character.  You cannot help but be mesmerized until the very end, but at the same time, not sure you want to ever see it again.",POSITIVE
"Nov 3, 2019","I have to admit it took a while for the action to speed up .However, once it did  I enjoyed the movie.",POSITIVE
"Nov 3, 2019","Joker delves into the minds of the mentally ill. this show helps explain how the joker began.  if you're looking for a Batman type movie, you will be disappointed. if you're looking for a very interesting intense dive into mental illness, you will enjoy this movie.  Joaquin Phoenix does an excellent joker falling down the rabbit hole.",POSITIVE
"Nov 3, 2019","It was very slow in the beginning, but finally picked up towards the end.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 3, 2019","It keeps to the idea of One bad day can reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. Amazing performance, dark but relatable.",POSITIVE
"Nov 3, 2019",One of the best origin stories ever created-has to be both an Oscar worthy picture and performance.,POSITIVE
"Nov 3, 2019",Joaquin Phoenix is stellar,POSITIVE
"Nov 3, 2019",There were a lot of boring parts and there are interesting parts.,NEGATIVE

"Nov 1, 2019",It was long and boring.,NEGATIVE
"Nov 1, 2019",Excellent movie. Its a serious and slow movie where you have to pay attention but the story is really good. You actually feel bad for the guy and understand his transformation to insanity. I highly recommend this movie to any Batman fans.,POSITIVE
"Nov 1, 2019","It was a movie that made me feel such a rollercoaster of emotions. From discomfort to sympathy to laughter to shock, this movie made me feel all of them and still kept me interested. It walked a tightrope of all those emotions and more and kept me hooked. Loved it.",POSITIVE
"Nov 1, 2019","Powerful story on how our societies’ mental health systems are failing us. Joaquin Phoenix gives a heart wrenching performance as Arthur Fleck my heart broke for him as I too suffer mental illness. I am not typically a fan of marvel type movies, but when The Joker ended I felt like I wasn’t ready for it to be over. This film was very powerful in its message and actors performances and I would see it again.",POSITIVE
"Nov 1, 2019",oscar worthy performance,POSITIVE
"Nov 1, 2019",I cant believe how good it was. I'm glad they made a movie to show how bad mental illness is. an to leave people the fk alone.,POSITIVE

"Nov 1, 2019",amazing dark deep journey if i had to sum this movie up,POSITIVE
"Nov 1, 2019","Honestly, it was terrifying, sad, and absolutely beautiful.",POSITIVE
"Nov 1, 2019","Such a controversial film but going in with an open mind will allow you to enjoy the film more. Incredible acting, cinematography, directing. Definitely one of the best origin stories that did the clown prince of crime justice.",POSITIVE
"Nov 1, 2019","I'm used to Joker as a chemistry and mechanical genius, a sociopath or an anarchist.

Perhaps Pheonix's character becomes this in the future, but I expected to see a flicker of that in this film.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 1, 2019","Did not like the movie at all. I felt like it was way too graphic. The movie portrayed the killings as a norm. I almost feel like it gave justification for people with mental health problems and the bad behaviors they tend to have as being okay. Like it’s okay to commit heinous crimes if you have a mental health disorder. I walked out feeling extremely uncomfortable and on edge. Honestly, I felt like someone would get up from their seat at any minute and start shooting up the theater. That’s not a feeling you want to have after watching a movie. Unless, that was the whole point of Joker.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 1, 2019",it was a slow intense build up. mental health us a thing proven in this movie.,POSITIVE
"Oct 29, 2019","If there is such thing as a masterpiece, ""Joker"" has to be the closest thing I've seen to one.",POSITIVE
"Oct 29, 2019","Brilliant movie, superb acting.  The only let down was that while it was cast in the Batman universe there really was no reason for it.  Because it was in the Batman universe I expected a bit more of the comic.  I would still recommend this movie and I would think it would be up for a lot of awards.",POSITIVE
"Oct 29, 2019",loved it. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing!!!,POSITIVE
"Oct 29, 2019",Excellent movie. I liked how the movie showed how we get to the places in life we are in. The acting was superb. It was gripping and raw.,POSITIVE

"Oct 29, 2019",Joaquin Phoenix is amazing in this role. A must see! This movie provides a good background to the Joker and how he came to be who he is.,POSITIVE
"Oct 29, 2019","It really expressed the true nature of mental health, and how desperately important it is to seek help.  It also displayed how truly terrifying it can be for the government to abandon us when we are at our most vulnerable times.  It was an absolute masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Oct 29, 2019",This movie was great! Cant wait to go again!,POSITIVE
"Oct 29, 2019",Loved how the movie told the story of the Joker and still linked his story to Batman.,POSITIVE
"Oct 29, 2019",The violence was somewhat realistic and was not meant for the kids some parents brought into the movie. Otherwise it brought in the background the series needed.,POSITIVE
"Oct 29, 2019",Omg! I absolutely loved this movie! Joaquin Phoenix is awesome playing Joker! He nailed it!!! I could see it again & I never watch a movie twice! Everyone should see this movie!! My son and I really enjoyed it!,POSITIVE

"Oct 29, 2019","The theme, The writing but especially the lead roll",POSITIVE

"Oct 29, 2019","El dolor..... el sufrimiento...Las heridas...

como puede un ser humano reponerse a las heridas de la infancia? Hasta que punto pueden un hombre o una mujer rehacerse desde de sus cenizas, cuando la pobreza, la desabilidad fsica o mental y la falta de amor y oportunidades lo han convertido en un humano que se desvaloriza ? Que puede hacerse cuando el ambiente nunca cesa de ser hostil? l , buscando rescatar la fuerza interior que lo salve del desastre en un amigo, un tutor, un maestro, compaeros , en su madre en la calle algo que le sostenga en su cada y le recuerde su belleza y su dignidad. Pero para muchos, ese angel nunca aparece.

Una historia de injusticia y dolor, pero tan real como la vida de tantos seres humanos. Una vida de abuso durante la infancia, una enfermedad mental, un ambiente donde nadie te ve como ser humano sino como basura no lleva a nada bueno.

Detrs de cada ser humano hay una historia que necesita ser escuchada. Por eso es necesario mirar a los seres humanos con compasin antes de juzgar.

Dice Eckhart Tolle: ""Cuando te veas tentado a juzgar a una persona piensa: 'Si su pasado fuera tu pasado, si su dolor fuera tu dolor, si su nivel de conciencia fuera tu nivel de conciencia, pensaras y actuaras exactamente como l o ella'. Esta compresin trae consigo perdn, compasin y paz"".

Se trata de acercarte con compasin a quienes sufren y alentar sus vidas. Se trata de no juzgar lo que no sabemos. Que distinto seria el mundo si mirramos a cada ser humano con compasin. URGE EDUCACIN EMOCIONAL Y ESPIRITUAL consciencia de la importancia de la salud mental y emocional desde nios!!! Que los padres tambin se atiendan! Es la base de todo...para que tanta educacin intelectual cuando lo importante es el gestionar las emociones, sanar heridas y reconstruirse ..

Very different role for him and he pulled it off artistically and with great accomplishment. The musical score was brilliant as it aligned with each scene.",POSITIVE

"Oct 28, 2019","The settings, props, cinematography, were great and Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic.

"Oct 28, 2019",probably one of the worst movies ever. I have no interest in watching the desperate struggles of a mentally ill and abused man.,NEGATIVE
"Oct 28, 2019","Phenomenal piece of film. This is a different take on the Joker, somewhat following along with ""The Killing Joke's"" origin. Nevertheless it is a great ""origin"" that tackles themes of poverty, mental illness, existentialism, ethics, and the current state of how society deals with relationships and encounters with strangers. The score is incredible and the scenes are filled to the brim with content to extract. Every actor, especially Phoenix, is acting at the top of their game and it makes for a truly immersive film. The character development of Arthur as a mentally ill loner into a revolutionary anarchist is well drawn out and clear in it's shift.",POSITIVE

I am very much aware of the “best joker” debate, and I would like to say that they are incomparable. Phoenix really played a far different joker than I would have imagined, far more different from the other depictions also. The slow transformation into the joke was incredible to watch, and the sudden realities checks were exciting. This movie has perfectly depicted the hardships and inequality this society suffers, and unlike the jokers that came before, this joker represents something new and different.",POSITIVE
"Oct 28, 2019","The story about the Joker was sad, almost heartbreaking.  It shined a spotlight on mental illness, child abuse and the simple lack of support from society.",POSITIVE

"Oct 28, 2019","I really wanted to like this because the performances were fantastic and the cinematography was gorgeous, but if I'm honest, I found myself bored while watching Joker. It could have worked as a character study without being attached to the DC universe, but as a comic book movie, this was just bleak and bland. An origin story for Heath Ledger's enigmatic, chaotic Joker would have been much more interesting.",NEGATIVE

Loved it being more of a mental health issue, pushed over the edge instead of the normal comic-booky type",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2019","I just finished watching Joker and I have to say it was a rather disturbing experience. 

Anyone who knows the history of the character knows that its a very dark and disturbing origin story. Its depicted on the big screen as a combination of mental illness, post-traumatic stress disorder due to childhood abuse, and a traumatic brain injury/neurological disorder. 

The film is also a disturbing depiction and allegory for the current socio-economic and political upheaval going on in our country and in the world in general.  I really couldnt help but think that some marginalized individual is going to take this movie as inspiration to re-create some of the mayhem depicted on the screen. And I think more so with this film that focused on a single character in his dark origin than any of the previous movies in which he was one part of a more obviously almost cartoonish action flick. 

  In any event, I dont think it added anything that we didnt already know or that the DC universe need. It just left me wondering how this has become entertainment and regretting having contributed to its box office. 

  Just my opinion though. Maybe I am becoming the old get off my lawn guy. You might feel differently.",NEGATIVE

Las muchas emociones que sucumben en ti al verla te llevan a concientizar con Arthur como a incomodarte con el pero siempre aprecias el notorio y sublime personaje que es de la mano de la epifanía actuación de Joaquín Phoenix. 

Todo en esta película te dice clásico y te da una de las más obvias pero duras críticas a la sociedad el sistema y las personas como espejos de este además de recordarlos la amabilidad al prójimo y lo importante de una buena salud mental. ",POSITIVE

"Oct 21, 2019","I felt that it was well directed and gives insight into how a clown named  Arthur became Joker. It gives a look inside the world of people with disabilities. In this case it was environmental. He was subjected to physical, mental, and emotional abuse as a child. His mother was mentally ill more over suffered from delusional and confused thoughts. Mainly, a personality disorder. As a mental health professional myself I can understand how people end up like the Joker in real life. He was dealing with a broken system that lost funding just like in real life. With out counseling and medications people suffer and can not manage their psychosis. The antagonist in this movie I would say was the guy worked with him and gave him a loaded gun knowing that Arthur was low functioning. Also the protagonist in the movie was Arthur. It's a must see I would not recommend it for light at heart. It has some extreme violence in the movie and its not recommended for a younger audience. ",POSITIVE

The movie reminds you that the world ain't all sunshine and rainbows where we can all hold hands and sing kumbaya, it's a cold, dark, mean, nasty, and unforgiving place.

"Oct 19, 2019","I went to the movies with my son, an avid comics fan, with low expectations due to what the ""tomatometer"" critics were writing.

I WILL NEVER BELIEVE THE TOMATOMETER AGAIN!

This was a phenomenal reintroduction to a prominent villain from DC.  They did such a great job with character development that I am waiting for more from DC with great anticipation.  

It takes a great villain to make a greater super hero.  The connection between the Joker and Bruce Wayne will be a never ending, twisted, and endearing struggle from here on out.

Though I felt it had a slow start; I loved every minute of the movie once he found himself.  I was even caught by surprise (blindsided) by plot twists.

I am going to buy this one for the collection, and possibly go see it again at the theater ",POSITIVE

"Oct 14, 2019","Joker is a film about a man's transformation from the mentally ill loner Arthur Fleck to the widely-known villain Joker. This seems straightforward enough, but there are much deeper messages in this movie that apply not just to this fictional universe, but to our real world. 
Arthur is a man who has been beaten down by not just society but fate itself time and time again. He has been dealt, for lack of a better term, a shit hand and no one in his life seems to truly want to help him. He is a man that truly is alone in society, learning throughout the film how true that statement really is. 
While the actions committed by him are definitely wrong, we understand him and can even somewhat empathize with him (hopefully we can, I may just be weird). Unlike how some people like to suggest, this movie doesn't glorify the violence that Arthur causes. This movie shows how horrible people can be created by the environment they are living in. We are living in a time where we like to blame the violence around us on the insane people who start it. Shootings are happening more than ever, and the insane gunman is responsible for it. 
Of course, it cannot be denied that the gunman is at fault. There is clearly something wrong with the people who do these things. However, much too few people think, ""Why is this happening?"", ""Why are these people doing the things they do, and how can we stop them from doing this?"" We see the result of what happens when an at risk individual doesn't get the help he needs in this movie. What we need is a system that can actually help these people. 
The movie Joker differs from other comic book movies because it is not only grounded in reality, but it's messages can be directly applied to our world. People like Arthur Fleck, people who have been brutally beaten by life at every turn need a way to be helped. The rich and successful don't care about these people. These people are viewed as threats instead of who they really are: humans, just like everyone else. We need to create an outlet where these individuals can get the actual support they need, not stuff them with medication and let specialists with their own agendas pretend to care about them. 
Another argument I've seen about this movie is that it has no reason for existing. It shows violence and shows a unique portrayal of a popular character but it has no substance to it. As you can probably tell, I strongly disagree with anyone who believes this, and I truly believe anyone who thinks this completely missed the point of the entire movie.
In conclusion, this movie definitely has substance and doesn't glorify violence in the slightest. This movie brings up an issue in our society that we have been neglecting for far too long. There's a stigma about mentally ill people that we have to get over. People who have been neglected and have nothing left to lose are the most dangerous type of people, and the problem with our society is that we allow people to feel as if they have nothing left to lose. Arthur Fleck is just a person who never got any sign at all that he was needed or loved by society, or anyone for that matter. He is truly, as cliche as this may sound, a product of his environment. You can criticize this movie for being too dark but by doing so you're just dismissing the reality we live in.

Its a very creepy, emotional movie hat has some gory scenes, but to be clear - I dont think that it condones violence at all, simply seeks to dig into the problems that we as a society have yet to face and shows how bad the outcome can be. Aside from the controversy, everything about this film is a masterpiece. The music, the lighting. Joaquin Phoenix. I would definitely see it again.",POSITIVE

"Oct 14, 2019","A film acclaimed by internet film gurus that I genuinely do not get the hype for. I walked out wondering if they saw a different film than me. Todd Phillips mishandles one of comic book's most legendary characters and gives us a dreadful two hour, downright repetitive film. You really feel the directors struggle trying to compel us with the same scenes over and over. I lost count of the times the filmed stopped to show a slow motion, overly-dramatic scene of Arthur dancing or him maniacally laughing. Is that the extent of his filmmaking craft? Is there not a better story they could conjure up to give the character some meaningful development other than just beating him up for ninety-minutes? Apparently not. ",NEGATIVE

"Oct 14, 2019","Really enjoyed this movie! Great storyline. Oddly enough, was cheering for Joker the whole time haha",POSITIVE
"Oct 14, 2019","This movie was brilliant. Keep in mind, this is a Joker origin movie of sorts, not the Wayne’s or Bruce, although they do play a part in the movie, especially Thomas Wayne. You get to witness what made him into the Joker we all love. Joaquin Phoenix IS our Joker now, in my opinion. He put on a spectacular show. Arguably the best in his career.",POSITIVE
"Oct 14, 2019",wow. i’m speechless. i would rate this a 6/5 if i could. joaquin phoenix’s portrayal of the joker is INSANE. i haven’t seen a movie this good in so long. i would definitely recommend watching.,POSITIVE
"Oct 14, 2019","One thing you should know about this movie is that it’s raw. It makes you feel like it’s real. You see a man slowly decline into madness from a world that’s very reminiscent of the one we live in now. Joaquin Phoenix fully engulfed himself in this role and it shows, he took The Joker and made it his own. Very good and original movie.",POSITIVE

"Oct 14, 2019","Not your typical DC/Marvel movie because it isn't one.. Amazing character development. A little morbid/violent that might turn some people off. Strong messages around themes of privilege and mental health. DC, take notes.",POSITIVE
"Oct 14, 2019",Movie was an excellent and a refreshingly gritty new take on the most notorious villain.,POSITIVE
"Oct 14, 2019","Deserves numerous Oscar for the score, Juaqin's performencs, and the amazing cinimetography. Every scene was truly a masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Oct 14, 2019",Acting in this movie is superb by Joaquin Phoenix. I was captivated from the start watching Arthur trying to fit in in an unforgiven world. His struggle with mental illness and yet a duty to work and take care of his responsibilities while contributing to society is intriguing. It is a shame that the everyday pressures of coping in this world finally breaks something in him that can't be put back together. Also the way the film switches from reality to his delusions forces you to pay attention to all the cues. Although this is a tough subject matter I do hope Arthur or better yet Joker can be further developed into a sequel.,POSITIVE

"Oct 13, 2019",Great take on Joker’s origin story!,POSITIVE
"Oct 13, 2019",Great flic. Not for the casual fan looking for an action movie but more for a drama that builds a character that is later on terrifying and a worthy villain to a super hero movie. This movie really shows how society can mold certain people to become a danger to them selves and others . Mental Illness is real and  you see it in the movie and the build Up with joker was dark and heavy but really shows how demented the joker really is and how he gets to be the iconic villain he is.,POSITIVE
"Oct 13, 2019",It really built up the character of the joker and how he became so sick and demented.,POSITIVE
"Oct 13, 2019","This was one of the best cinematic performances that I have ever witnessed in my life. It shocking and breathtaking, But very real and believable. So much so that I question the responsibility of making such a masterpiece, of this topic and nature.",POSITIVE

"Oct 13, 2019",The movie always kept me on my feet with what the Joker was about to do next. It really drew on mental health issues and the need to be non judgemental and treat everyone with respect.,POSITIVE
"Oct 13, 2019",Was a pretty good movie. Scary! But good. I say scary cause with all the mass shooting going on in the world this movie almost glorify killing.,POSITIVE
"Oct 13, 2019",Phoenix had an excellent performance.  His portrayal of a man transitioning from fighting for his sanity only to finally snap was so real.  I kind of felt sorry for the character to a degree. I loved the plot and the progression of the character and storyline. The cinematography was fantastic. Great movie.,POSITIVE

"Oct 12, 2019",Finally a good origin story! ,POSITIVE
"Oct 12, 2019",A very dark and disturbing look at mental health and how we as a society treat people with mental disorders,POSITIVE
"Oct 12, 2019","This film is a 7 or 8 out of 10 for me. The critics are lying when they claim this film is disturbing and violent, and if you don't believe me watch the film for yourself as oppose to listening to 'intelligent critics.' The script can be cheesey at times but Joacquin pulls the dialogue off perfectly and is by far the best thing about this movie, I'm certain no one else could be better. Some scenes are occasionally overlong and it definitely thinks it's smarter than it really is, but all in all I can't wait to see it again ",POSITIVE
"Oct 12, 2019","Dark, sad, and an emotional and mental rollercoaster. But the backstory connection and how it all comes together in the end was done masterfully. Joaquin's performance and Joker evolution was beautifully executed. Do not expect jolly-good action and adventure this is a movie that makes you think and feel. You need to see it.",POSITIVE

"Oct 12, 2019","Some people claim that the negative reviews for this film are due to it ""Offending"" people. This is not true. For this film to be offensive it would need to have a plot or a point. Instead this film is almost two hours of an untalented actor doing what looks like his shitty street theatre from the Fringe Festival occasionally broken up with scenes of him self pitying about how the neighbour whose name he doesn't know won't have sex with him or going on incoherent rants about how Mean Society Is To Him and how it Hurts His Feelings that people don't see how Special he is. If your a talentless 60 year old virgin living with their parents and working at Wal-Mart I'm sure this film might reward that sad part of you that's still convinced your Really Going to Do Some Important Stuff someday. For those of us who have actual lives and friends this film is a sad reminder of what absolute trash Hollywood continues to waste god knows how much money on.  ",NEGATIVE

"Oct 10, 2019","Disappointing 
Not well integrated with DC Universe",NEGATIVE
"Oct 10, 2019",IT WAS GREAT! This movie is supposed to tell the story as to HOW the joker became who he is. Its not expectant to be like the dark knight etc with total action. It looks deeper into mental illness and society as a whole. I loved how surprised I was by many twists in the story. I definitely felt uncomfortable with the bold music but loved the movie !,POSITIVE
"Oct 10, 2019",Great movie! Shows how mental illness really occurs and the signs surrounding it and the decline of the person and their environment,POSITIVE

"Oct 10, 2019","I can see why the critics rating are much lower than the audience rating. Joker however is not perfect in some areas, it's an amazing movie to watch. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 10, 2019","Tactful, intelligent, and breath-takingly visceral. A deeply passionate character study first, a comic book movie maybe third or fourth. After his inspired performance in You Were Never really Here, Joaquin Pheonix has mastered acting the part of a complex, challenging character. He brings a dignity and grace to a franchise I previously thought was long dead and soulless.",POSITIVE

"Oct 10, 2019","Haunting, disturbing, and depressingly dark.

Todd Phillips' psychological crime drama Joker (2019) is his most mature feature film yet. Certainly targeting adults only as Joker is brutal in its bloody violence, disturbing in its bleak perspective, depressing in its hopeless attitude, and dark in its somber tone for the entire duration of Joker's quick 122 minute run-time. Jeff Groth's editing cuts quickly from scene to scene without unnecessary explanations, creating a dream sequence feel to many of the Joker's scenes. You are disoriented by Groth's style in a fantastic way as you are forced to focus in on Arthur and experience his journey into madness.

Phillips directs Joker like its a real crime origin story instead of a standard comic book movie. Gone is the facade of green screen everywhere and visual effects propping up lackluster stories, writing, directing, and acting. Phillips outdirects every Marvel and DC film since The Dark Knight back in 2008. Joker easily rivals Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins and The Dark Knight for me. His influences are apparent as Todd Phillips takes his shot at crafting his own Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, Raging Bull, The Master, and You Were Never Really Here. Phillips pays homage without feeling like he's ripping off classic cinema. Phillips' direction is fascinating in his down to Earth approach with each scene. Joker is like a gritty documentary more than a thriller. He takes an indie drama feel into the blockbuster world of comic book villainy to enthrall into Arthur Fleck's nihilistic world of suffering as he devolves into The Joker. This grounded approach makes Joker feel more mature and nuanced than previous incarnations of The Clown Prince of Crime.

Joker looks incredible, but it's the emotional distress that Joker causes that makes the movie so powerful. Todd Phillips and Scott Silvers' script is an onslaught of misery as Arthur and the audience alike are pelted by cruelty, abuse, murder, outrage, corruption, and sorrow around every dirty corner within Joker. Phillips does question the mindset of the Joker as he's still the villain of the story, but we are following from his point of view. Society is the menace that destroys Arthur Fleck causing him to turn to mass murder, but Joker is still mad and wrong for his killings in the end as he's locked up for his perspective. Phillips gives his character's frame of mind a fair chance and an empathetic viewpoint through his compassionate storytelling that clearly wants audiences to relate to the most notorious comic book villain of all time. Todd Phillips has written and directed one of 2019's finest films hands down!

Furthermore, Lawrence Sher's cinematography is perhaps the most striking aspect to Joker. The stunning images flow like an urban ocean of oppression as the flawed society from Joker's mind is made real. The audience is subjected to all manner of dangerous thinking as the camera often holds on Joker's face in beautiful close-up shots that creates both a surreal view and a realistic depiction of anguish. 

Likewise, Mark Friedberg's production design harks back to the dirty cityscapes of Taxi Driver and the grungy rooms of You Were Never Really Here with a grotesque display of furnishings. I adored Mark Bridges' costume designs. The colorful red and green suit for the Joker's final ascension into crime is cool, playful, and creative. Bridges takes all the most famous designs of clown costumes and subverts into outfits a regular clown for hire might be able to slap together. His realistic designs are the stuff of movie magic!

Similarly, I have to mention the outstanding realistic make-up from Nicki Lederman, who deserves an Oscar for her work in Joker. The colors are vibrant, but her choices create the most haunting clown make-up ever captured on film. I think I now prefer the disgusting verisimilitude of Lederman's make-up to even Heath Ledger's Joker make-up in The Dark Knight. Nicki Lederman's make-up is really that effective!

Joaquin Phoenix gives 2019's most grueling and devastating performance of a broken man. Phoenix is astonishing as Arthur Fleck as his transformation from the muscle bound behemoth in You Were Never Really Here to the near skeletal frame of Fleck. His physicality derives an uncanny effect as you are repulsed by his appearance and strange movements. Yet, you sympathize with his Joker as he endures constant bullying and verbal abuse. The mental strain of society finally gets to him and Phoenix pulls off a more suddenly violent and rage filled Joker that even Heath Ledger's legendary anarchist portrayal. Phoenix allows his Joker to breathe in hopelessness and wallow in Arthur's misery as he cries, screams, and laughs his way into your heart. I felt just awful watching Joker as sequence after sequence emotionally drains you, largely due to Phoenix' moving performance. I could argue Joaquin Phoenix has done the impossible by surpassing Heath Ledger's iconic performance as Joker in Nolan' The Dark Knight as Phoenix is so charismatic, likable, and empathetic in his portrayal. By the end, you recognize the crazy and unpredictable madman from the comics that we have all come to know and love for decades.

Robert De Niro gives his best acting since The Score (2001) and Stone (2010), so that's either 10 or 20 years depending on which film of De Niro's you liked last. His two-faced late night host Murray Franklin perfectly lambastes the shallow interviewing, cheap comedy, and terrible television hosts like Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, James Corden, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, Ed Sullivan, and especially David Letterman. 

As for the supporting actors in Joker, Brett Cullen's sleazy take on Thomas Wayne is hard to watch, but a great performance. Marc Maron gets a neat cameo too as Ted Marco. Brian Tyree Henry's cameo as a sympathetic Arkham Asylum clerk named Carl is awesome and memorable. Shea Wigham and Bill Camp's detectives add a gravitas and tension to Joker that I appreciate. Leigh Gill's fearful and ridiculed Gary is an impressive role for how few lines he is given. Lastly for the guys, Glenn Fleshler's Randall is a huge jerk and an intriguing performance. He reminds me of Peter Boyle's friendly and gruff fellow cab driver in Taxi Driver, except this time, Fleshler's Randall is irredeemable. 

Frances Conroy gives a touching performance as the fragile mother to Arthur named Penny Fleck. You have to see the warm, likable, and friendly performance from Zazie Beetz as Arthur's love interest Sophie Dumond. Beetz is a kindly face in a cold world.

Hildur Guðnadóttir's score is bombastic and riveting. She composes a memorable sonic underbelly for Gotham and her clown crime lord. I do not want to spoil any of the intense and cool music cues, so I will just say I hope she gets an Oscar nomination, at least, for her Joker score. I love that Todd Phillips chose Cream's ""White Room"" for Joker's coolest moment during the riot finale. Sadly, it comes at the same time as influential jazz drummer Ginger Baker just passed, so may he rest in peace alongside legendary bassist and singer for Cream: Jack Bruce.

In all, Joker is an inspired psychological indie drama masquerading as a comic book thriller. Todd Phillips directs his greatest film with Joker's unforgettable visuals, gripping storytelling, and nuanced acting. You will regret missing seeing Joker in theaters as the Joker's insanity demands to be witnessed on the big screen. Chaos reigns in Joker's well worth watching world of pain.

"Oct 9, 2019","Overall, it’s a sensational movie with an extremely well done background for the Joker. A departure from the cartoonish versions of past Batman movies. This version is grounded in a more graphic and realistic evolution of the character.

"Oct 9, 2019","What a really great origin movie.  This is done in a very real-life manner, with no supernatural or superhuman content.  The development of Arthur Fleck's character, including some of the twists and turns, causing him to spiral further and further, is very engaging.  There were some slow and predictable moments in the first half of the movie.  Part of that is due to them giving too much away in the trailers.  However, the end more than makes up for it.  Joaquin did a magnificent job, which may be Oscar worthy, though I would still say that Heath Ledger's Joker was the all-time best and most unique and sinister portrayal.  Definitely see this film and then make your own judgement.",POSITIVE

"Oct 9, 2019",A disgrace to the Joker character of the comic series. Joker may be crazy but he was diabolical and highly intelligent. The movie with Phoenix creates a weak mental patient whose pathetic life never lead to anything close to being the smartness of the true JOKER. Instead we are faced with a director who seems more interested in making his own interpretation instead of showing us how madness and intellect can be on the same scale. All the hype and BS and you will end this movie wondering why the joke was on you spending your money for a ticket on the this. ,NEGATIVE

"Oct 7, 2019","One of the best origin stories Ive ever seen. And SO dark! The director really tried to get you into the mind of Arthur, to the point where you didnt know what was reality and what was being imagined. No way Phoenix shouldnt get an Oscar nod for this.

"Oct 7, 2019","My spoiler-free review of Joker is below. This isn't a film for everyone. If you are a comic book nerd, or just enjoy the superhero genre of movies, this might be of interest to you. That said, this film only barely qualifies as a comic book film. It's more like Raging Bull or Dirty Harry minus Harry Callahan.

This film was an excellent stand-alone Joker origin story. The film is set in the late 70s and director Todd Phillips and crew worked hard to pay homage to the 70s style of film making with this film. Right out of the gate, they dug up the old Warner Brothers logo which helps set the tone before the first frame is ever shown. There are a number of scenes where the soundtrack and sound effects evoke a very 70s feel as well. There is even a central scene that, to me, evoked Bernard Goetz (okay, that happened in the '80s but it still felt organic in the film).
Joaquin Phoenix delivers a remarkable performance as Arthur Fleck/Joker. Normally with this genre, you don't get to see a lot of really decent acting on display, especially the type that requires a physical transformation of the actor and a deep shift in their personality. Here Joaquin Phoenix just knocks it out of the park delivering a character that is unsettling, emotionally distributed, creepy, and even a little sad. You are never given the impression that Arthur Fleck is sane, just that he is deeply troubled and his mental issues put those around him ill at ease. To make matters worse for him, the painfully unfunny Arthur dreams of being a standup comic, a plotline that appears in some classic Batman stories. That coupled with a crime-riddled city that seems to be falling apart, a populace that is ready to go to war with the rich, whom they blame for all of the city's issues, and personal issues that enter into spoiler territory, Arthur Fleck's downhill slide toward becoming the Joker is well laid out. None of it has the hackneyed feeling of supervillain origins from earlier Batman films like falling into vats of chemicals or being poisoned by plants. This is a descent from madness to monstrosity that could easily be ripped from today's headlines.
The Gotham 'eat the rich' crowd has shades of the Occupy, Antifa, BLM, and Resist movements, where demonstrations against perceived injustices eventually give way to violence and riots. Arthur is fueled, in part, by this in ways that also border on spoiler territory. However, by the end of the film, it's easy to see why people are concerned about whether this film could be a trigger for violence. It's an excellent film but it's not hard to see the possibility that certain unbalanced individuals might see Joker as a folk hero moreso than a disturbed villain. Unlike films like Falling Down where there are good cops working hard to bring the deranged but slightly sympathetic bad guy down, there is no serious equivalent in this film. There isn't a strong counterbalance to Arthur's madness. Batman does not exist yet.
We are shocked by what he does because we know it's madness. The fear is that the real would be Jokers in our midst don't see the madness as madness. These days, it feels like a legitimate concern, though I don't think that it should stop people from making films like this.
This film holds up a dark mirror to modern society in a few ways. It raises questions about how we treat those with mental illnesses while at the same time making a villain of the mentally ill character. I'm not sure how that will be received by the mental health community but it does serve to generate a little bit of sympathy for Arthur Fleck.
It's not a perfect film, I am not sure that a perfect film exists. Robert DeNiro is miscast as a Johnny Carson like talk show host which is just a bad fit for him. The main 'rich guy' character of Thomas Wayne is a little 2-dimensional, though you could chalk that up to driving the story forward. Some of Arthur's outbursts seem a little forced and there are a few places where you might question how this guy is still walking around free by the end of the film. The film is, perhaps, a bit too dark and gritty; a few moments of genuine levity would be good to break up the darkness. It's also very obvious how the film is going to end by about the halfway point but that's OK. I knew how Titanic was going to end too but I still enjoyed it. I'll probably be seeing it again in the theater.",POSITIVE
"Oct 7, 2019",well made movie with good playlist and great plot.,POSITIVE
"Oct 7, 2019","This is a great film but I have to rate it based on how it made me feel. It was treacherous to watch. I didn't know what to expect from it but perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I'd prepared myself for a horror movie, something I enjoy and watch frequently. It was bleak as hell but certainly well made. ",NEUTRAL

"Oct 7, 2019",Enjoyed but very dark,POSITIVE
"Oct 7, 2019","While Joker isn't exactly groundbreaking for film, it's one of the best, actually intelligent comic book movies ever made. The fact that it is a comic book movie is probably what holds it back the most, as Batman Superfans probably won't enjoy that this is a movie about mental illness, society, and gun violence in a comic book movie's clothing. If you don't care and have an open mind, Joker is must watch.

The only other problems I have with Joker are: 1. Sometimes the score can't decide between happy music or grand orchestral music, so it plays both, and it sounds jarring, and 2. A twist that occurs 2/3rds in the movie is explicitly explained multiple times, which I found annoying.",POSITIVE
"Oct 7, 2019",Very good movie and beat my expectations. After 10+ years of super heros movies getting more and more over the top. Its nice to see a good look into a villain and the beginning of the chaos.,POSITIVE

(Light spoilers for Dark Knight 2008/The Joker 2019.)

In 2008 my wife, several friends and I attended a screening of The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger appeared, made a pencil disappear and won the hearts of audiences everywhere. Including ours. We laughed at his magic trick. We laughed at his psychopathic banter. We laughed when he tried to blow up a hospital and we laughed when he succeeded. He was just so fun to watch. He was fun to quote. Fun to joke about. From Jack Nicholson to Mark Hamill, The Joker has generally been portrayed as an entertaining figure. He does terrible things, but he does them with a morbid sense of humour that captivates audiences.

When I saw the trailer for The Joker, I expected something closer to Dark Knight than Burton's '89 Batman, but I knew we were getting a different take. I knew that the actual meat of this version bore little resemblance to the movies or comics that came before, but I didn't realize it'd be quite this different.

Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is no laughing matter. He isn't entertaining to watch, and that is very much by design.

From the very first scene, there's just something that isn't right about him. He stumbles through a series of disturbing interactions with strangers, neighbours, coworkers and family and it is almost immediately apparent that everyone in his life is counting the seconds until they get to stop talking to him. He is the kind of man you might cross the street to avoid. The movie has a way of making you feel like you yourself are trapped in a room with him and if you're like me, you might find yourself counting the seconds until a scene change offers you some brief sense of relief.

I partially expected that from the trailer, but what I didn't expect was how unrelenting it would be. I thought this was the build up to some more fully realized version of the Joker that would feel more quippy and familiar, but it isn't. At his most fully realized, this Joker is just as uncharismatic, unfunny and unsettling as he was at the start of the movie.

If I understand correctly, the big fear attached to this film is that it might present a version of the Joker who is a 'Patron Saint of Incels', or that it might inspire a mass shooting.

Personally, I don't see it. This Joker doesn't strike me as someone who would identify as an incel at all. And as for a mass shooter? Here's another weird thing by movie standards he doesn't even kill that many people. I think I counted six confirmed kills, with up to three more occurring off-screen. Nine is a fairly modest number, as far as movie murderers, or even Jokers go. And shy of haphazardly lashing out at a society he believes has wronged him, this Joker's kills are targeted at people with whom he has prior relationships (or perceived relationships). If anything, this version of the Joker seems less mass-shootery than Heath Ledger's version (who fired into crowds and blew up a hospital).

It'd seem more likely that he would inspire a serial killer than a mass shooter, since that is what he technically is. Having seen the movie though? I really doubt it. This movie does not glamourize or glorify the violence in any way. The kills aren't staged to look cool, or amusing, or to feel exciting. They're quick and ugly and leave you feeling a little queasy.

While I wouldn't consider other incarnations of The Joker to be aspirational figures, there's often something in there to admire. Generally there's a wit, a style, a sense of humour, a certain level of self-assuredness, or an odd kind of competency. If nothing else, he's got good branding.

Arthur Fleck is charmless, rudderless, unsexy, uncool and about as far from aspirational as you'd ever be likely to get. He certainly is sympathetic in part, but that sympathy only stretches so far, especially given how difficult he is to watch.

In a weird way, I think this movie holds a mirror up to the Joker. It strips him of all frills and pretense and shows us what the character actually is at its core a deranged, dangerous and mentally unstable man whom you would never want to meet.

Basically, if Heath Ledger's Joker is Breaking Bad, Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is Requiem For a Dream.",NEUTRAL

Heath Ledgers portrayal as Joker in The Dark Knight was definitely something that was going to be stuck in the back of my head whilst watching this, and I was always going to be overly critical. However.... JP did such an incredible job and the dedication that he put towards the character was evident in every scene. This movie was dark, edgy, and unsettling at times, leaving me with my mouth wide open in awe. The score was great and there was some amazing shots and sequences.

"Oct 5, 2019",It was very intense but riveting.  You wanted to look away but you couldnt.  He is an awesome actor but I worry about him. A person cannot dig that deep into a character and not take something away from it.  His eyes were just so sad.  I wanted to take him in my arms and just gently rock him...... very good film,POSITIVE

"Oct 4, 2019",I'm not one to review movies. But this movie was so close to perfect it....just wow. Joaquin HAS to get an oscar for this. From the plot to the tension to the atmosphere and my God the cinematography to the little easter eggs.....such little dashes of fanservice that didnt interrupt Phoenix's oscar performance. Just....Bravo. This is the only Joker origin story that matters,POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019","JP is extraordinary in this film. His performance in this psychodrama origin adaptation of the Joker is Oscar worthy. The writing is amazing, as it answers a lot of questions many have had about the character over the years.  ",POSITIVE

"Oct 4, 2019",Una obra de arte. Es la pelicula del año y tal vez en varios mas,POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019","So is this movie very worth to watch? Definitely. ""Joker"" is a gritty movie, a character study not just a limit to the Joker as an identity. This is a great spectacle. If you feel bored with superhero films, this is for you. It's introducing us to the Joker far from an expectation unless we forget the source material of the comic book. There are violence and murder which I don't think this movie influenced many people to be like the Joker. Despite the controversy, this is a great movie.",POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2019",Journalist: We can save the world by hating on this movie.,POSITIVE

"Oct 3, 2019","it's an amazing insight into deep psychological themes, and the impact society has on the mentally ill",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019","Solid. I wouldn't call it ground breaking or anything. It was just a really solid movie. The script was above average, pacing was plodding at times, the second act could of been a little tighter, but Joaquin Phoenix's performance and the score, which was absolutely gorgeous, carried the movie through some of it's minor short comings.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019","I didn’t think anyone would be able to compare with Heath Ledger’s amazing performance in the Dark Knight. Joaquin Phoenix did just that. Phenomenal acting by Phoenix as the lead role, he deserves an academy award. This movie is dark, disturbing, and makes one think after its conclusion. The movie gives an in-depth insight to the issues of mental health. Five stars.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019","Exceptional, Dark and an Oscar worthy performance!",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019","I can resiliently say that Joker is a movie the world needed. Most critics get carried away by political, personal and sometimes illicit influences as they review it. In this way it presents a disturbed view of masterful works. Joker touches delicate subjects in a way that is rarely seen in today's theaters. If the world can't handle a profound work like, then it means the world needs to change. And change the way we view complex social issues, which we prefer to isolate it from debate because of the high diversity of opinion. Very well built and set, Joker brings big holes that society has, and are covered.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019",Hands down one of the best DC comic book movies,POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019",This is what Oscar worthy performance looks like...worth every penny,POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019","The movie is really hard to describe, you need to see the movie to experience the dark reality & well portrayed act by Phoenix... The movie is astoundingly breathtaking. Highly recommended it.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019",Amazing backstory for The Joker! Ha Ha Ha Ha! ,POSITIVE

"Oct 3, 2019",Absolutely beautiful! It's a must watch for all!,POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019","I think there are a lot of ways to interpret this movie, but in this movie, I saw a man, who tries to fit in, tries to meet the expectation of society, just to be shut out or to be let down again and again. And after that one final push, he gets to the conclusion to be just himself,a twisted individual, but still himself and do what he wants without caring because he has nothing to lose really. And It gave me the CHILLS.I love how Joker, a comic book villain, is portrayed so realistically and Joaquin Phoenix did an awesome job delivering it.",POSITIVE
"Oct 3, 2019","this is not Disney movie, wake up people ",POSITIVE
