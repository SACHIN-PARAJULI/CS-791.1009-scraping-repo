"Apr 3, 2024","The film with the most beautiful photography I have ever seen.
The film doesn't give many explanations about the characters but you still manage to identify with that character. The film has some crazy settings. The villain manages to steal the show when he appears",NEUTRAL
"Mar 29, 2024","Witness this intense and action packed battle on the road for home! As the Imperator Furiosa defies the oppressive Immortan Joe by stealing his wives and his war rig, she joins forces with the drifter Max Rockatansky to fight off Joe's War-boys in order to return to the Green Place. An epic in so many ways, we are thrown into a brutal, desert wasteland of violence and war, with a memorable cast of characters making it epic!",NEUTRAL

"Feb 23, 2024",Only thing that makes the film respectable to this rating is due to the stunts all being done by the actors. Apart from that I can name at least 10 action films to better spend 1.5 hours of your time.,NEUTRAL

"Feb 6, 2024","A perfect movie and far-and-away the best action of the decade. So many original characters with underrated arcs, all the more impressive with lack of dialogue and short runtime.

"Jan 29, 2024",Worse then Thunderdome.  I watched when it came out and didn't like it.  All this time later I keep seeing reviews on how great it is. So I watched it again over the weekend.  Still don't see to merit the strong reviews.  They should have ended with Road Warrior.,NEUTRAL

"Jan 25, 2024","This is a great story in the Mad Max universe. Charleze Theron shows she's willing to push her acting skills to the max, and portrays the heroine in a superb fashion. Hardy is equally as fantastic. Respecting the rather dull scenery while applauding the cinematography, it is what it is ... post-apocalypse world with everything going to hell.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 23, 2024",I enjoyed the original Mad Max trilogy and It was very entertaining but nothing compared to this one. It was wall to wall action with no break. It's definitely worth the watch.,NEUTRAL

"Jan 10, 2024","Mad Max Fury Road is one hell of a ride. From beginning to end this film is heart pounding. The action/choreography is fantastic and leaves you with one very big adrenaline rush all due to its fast pace. the pacing was very fast which worked well for this kind of story. Then there are the performances which are great. Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy, and Nicholas Hoult where all great in this film with each one of seemingly becoming their characters rather than acting as them. In terms of direction George Miller shows off his abilities. Miller is amazing at making this steam punk dystopian world come to life. The fact that most of the visuals are made via practical effects is crazy. To add onto this, the cinematography and colors are great as well. Mad Max Fury Road is very fine filmmaking.

With all that being said I do find flaws in this film. The characters are pretty bland. The film is mostly fast paced however it does slow down at certain points to focus on it's characters. Characters like Furiosa, Max, and Nux were explored but, they weren't explored enough to make them particularly strong characters. They had the potential and when they were being explored it was great; however, they weren't fully explored/developed which is definitely the film's biggest flaw. The visual effects also looked a bit wacky and poor at times but that is more of a nitpick than an actual flaw. 

Mad Max Fury Road is from a visual and practical sense phenomenal with great themes and performances; however, it's characters aren't particularly it's strong point. Regardless, this is a fantastic film that I'll highly recommend.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 6, 2024",Greatest Action Movie of All time. No Debate,NEUTRAL
"Jan 4, 2024","Great reboot and a great film for action fans. While I initially didn't care for Tom Hardy's performance, it kind of grew on me after a second watch. He has very little dialogue but really does seem mad and haunted by his past. I hope the upcoming Furiosa movie is similar to this.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 13, 2023","Nothing short of a spectacular miracle. It exceeds your expectations on every conceivable level and will likely remain the gold standard for action blockbuster filmmaking for decades to come.

"Nov 24, 2023",Definitely has the feel of Fallout New Vegas for any Fallout fans. The cheesy humor in some parts is chef's kiss. It made me feel nostalgia for a time yet to exist in our timeline.,NEUTRAL
"Nov 21, 2023","I was indifferent to the original Mad Max movie, and I remember being disappointed by it on several attempts to watch it, so I wasn't expecting much from this sequel. Was I wrong though! This movie is almost non stop action, and the story is both exciting and easy to follow. The special effects are first rate, and I soon became absorbed into the film's world. To be honest, the character's don't have a lot to say, and you mostly pick up the plot from riding with them on their journey. That's not a bad thing in this case, because the film's pace is such that there is no time for the verbose narrative often found in other movies. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes action movies because it is one of the best I have seen.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 21, 2023",This is a test review,NEUTRAL
"Nov 18, 2023","All Time Classic. Pretty much everything about this is flawless. the only minor complaints is there isn't much character development with Max and dare I say it feels like he's not even the main character at certain points. Furiosa is incredible and the best thing in this. She outshines Max. Also, the fact they go back the way they came makes it feel a little bit like the escape of the first half was pointless to an extent but who cares. This is 2 hours of a straight adrenline rush and the most action packed of the franchise. I will say this is a hair beneath Mad Max 2 for me because while Hardy is really good as Max, Gibson is better. Also, Max had more development and focus and while the chases in this are amazing and incredible, the end of the second still I feel is slightly better. However, where the second can be a bit slow in the first half this floors it and never lets up the entire way. IT's really just personal taste at that point comparing this and 2. Watch it and decide for yourself!",NEUTRAL
"Nov 18, 2023","There's an early scene where a metal bard riffs on a flamethrower-guitar for no reason other than that he can; already a highlight. It only gets better from there, and this action-packed romp has loads of great character development to boot. Just stellar.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 16, 2023","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a mind-bending thrill ride that feels like Dune author Frank Herbert dropped acid and penned a contemporary action extravaganza—simply awesome! The film's relentless pace and imaginative world-building leave audiences craving more of its adrenaline-pumping energy.

"Aug 10, 2023",One of the most entertainment and action packed post apocalyptic adventure that never feels like a snore 9/10,NEUTRAL
"Aug 6, 2023","Might be the best action movie ever made. Besides the opening narration and some quick plot starters, the entire movie is one continuous two-hour-long car chase across the lovely wasteland. While watching, you are completely transported to a new world and can see and feel the real stunt work, the apocalyptic vehicles, and you are just left to marvel at it all and live on the edge of your seat in the process. It's impeccably shot and edited and scored and the main protagonists in Charlize Theron (Imperator Furiosa) and Tom Hardy (Max Rockatansky) are just a badass pair. You get the feeling George Miller did everything he ever wanted in a Mad Max film with his imagination and love, and maybe ended up making the best action/chase movie of all time.

"Jun 18, 2023","Good movie. Nice performances. But nothing over the top. The movie could easily be called ""George Fury Road"" and still be that movie. What I mean is that they should leave Max the character and introduce another one. It was more of an action movie rather than a tense fils like the previous 3 were.
The bad thing is that they are not revisiting the characters that were already introduced in the old movies and make a prequel that would show their stories .",NEUTRAL
"Jun 15, 2023","SPOILERS This apocalyptic fiction follows Max, a man coping with the death of his wife and child, who is captured by a group of survivors (more like lunatics), loyal to the tyrannical Immortan Joe. When Furiosa takes Joe's five wives in the War Rig to bring them East to their liberty, max is dragged along in an insane adventure full of monster trucks, explosions, fire, death, bullets, gas, gas and more gas. 

This is peak fiction. The apocalyptic desert that is depicted, the design of the war machines and costumes, the character arcs, fire, explosions, scale... its an action-fuelled masterpiece. The world Miller has crafted is so erratic, chaotic and octane filled - its insane and beautiful. A wasteland where humans treat gas like a god, completely obsessed with badass-looking vehicles and meeting their death on the road. I wanted more when the credits rolled, more time to explore this eccentric world and its characters. For lack of a better term the shit in this movie is strait up cool. Like look at the concept art for vehicles, the costumes and the landscape - and tell me its not fucking cool! The production design reminds me of Blade runner, not because it is at all similar, but because it is visually striking, unique, imaginative and captivating. They have created a world here which is not ours, a fictional world with nuances and touches that make it wonderful to get lost in. 

It was essentially non-stop action for two hours, and it never got old or boring, just high stakes over and over and over. The war rig was practically a character in itself and the battles moving at high speed will be forever etched in my mind. Two hours of strait action and I could have done with two more. There was some very credible and satisfying character arcs here as well amidst the explosions. Nux is absolutely the most notable. At the start of the film I hated this man and his people for their octane filled delusions of Valhalla and blatant insanity, but by the end I saw Nux as a man who put his life on the line for who he now considers friends. He escaped from the lies and oppression Joe was feeding his people. It was a powerful character transition and death. Max's relationship with Furiosa and the wives is a pleasure to see unravel and become somewhat friendly at the end too. 

One thing I really like about this film too is how it doesn't give you any exposition or explanation for the wasteland, factions, people, and how they came to be. At first I was confused (I haven't seen the originals), but I came to realize that them not opening the film up with some expedited narration, or exposition from the characters - makes it so much more intriguing and enthralling. The creators don't owe first time watchers an explanation as there's tons of previous movies and lore, and I like how we are not ‘babied' into this world, but simply taken along for the ride. 

Overall, Mad Max combines masterfully imaginative production design, world building, characters and gas to create one of the best action films I've ever seen.",NEUTRAL

They knew what they wanted to do with this movie the passion seeps through the screen in the most testosterone filled way I've ever seen. Few say that the plots too basic and the lore isn't explained at all, yeh and? The film makers are leaving it up to interpretation, their showing glimpses rather than telling all. Its like drawing on dotted lines to complete the drawing it's why we're shown glimpses of Max's past we don't fully know what happened but it's up to us to put the pieces together. It says a lot without showing too much throughout this entire movie. What else can I say that hasn't already been said? this is a perfect action movie the best of the 2010s in my opinion.",NEUTRAL

"Apr 6, 2023","A magnificent, visceral, dystopian, post apocalyptic, dark beauty. Mad Max 2 was argueably the post nuclear action drama pinnacle, purely for the impact it made by literally spawning the genre. It was often copied but ironically only ever equalled once and that was by this. Its as though the pinnacle of the genre was given a massive dose of steroids and told you said its mother was a whore. A true, snarling, angry, spiritual successor that surpasses everything before it in terms of sheer spectacle. Utterly magnificent and easily sets a new gold standard in terms of live action carnage. The cast all do their jobs superbly. Theron layers her performance beautifully and Hardy provides a near monosalabic, worldweary, yet expressively wide physical performance. . wonderful. Very close to the top of my all time favourite films list and bang at the top for post armageddon dystopia. Treat yourself, watch Mad Max 2 and then this for the ride of your life.

"Jan 22, 2023","I didn't what to make of this movie after knowing this was made by the same director as the previous films. This movie was strongly hyped and regarded highly but I wanted to see the original films first. Within ten minutes I realized something, this isn't a sequel, but a reboot, with a new Mad Max, like the Daniel Craig Bond movies replaced the previous Bond movies.

A dystopian world that ran low on resources had led Max Rockatansky to become a once respectable lawman into a road warrior in a post-apocalyptic world who gets caught up in a fight for his life. Captured and used for resources gets involved in a violent warlord's attempt to reclaim his offspring in five innocent expecting women taken from his care by a vicious but courageous female general known as Furiosa. Max escapes from the warlord only to run afoul of Furiosa's mission but slowly but steadily gain each other's trust. But the warlord will not give up until he obtains his offspring as Furiosa and Mad Max take the fight to the warlord.

I got to say I loved the previous Mad Max movies with all my heart, and just as Sean Connery will always be James Bond to me, Mel Gibson will always be Mad Max. Tom Hardy is fine but he doesn't have Mel's intensity and charisma. The real star of this movie is Charlize Theron who is amazing as an Amazonian-type character Furiosa. Not as feral as I heard described, but smart and brave as well as strong. George Miller should make more movies with her.

While I have not seen the original 3 movies, the story is still really understandable, however I must say, I definitely was a bit lost the first 10-15 minutes. Mad Max Fury Road has some of the most impressive practical effects ever put to screen, combine that was sublime VFX and you get some of the most gripping action ever. While Mad Max Fury Road has build its reputation of being an action movie, the movie certainly has so much more to offer storywise. George Miller his direction is fantastic, very stylisch editing and colors, but still remaining it grounded.

"Aug 16, 2017","GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, I thought we were done with the Fast and Furious series. Now we have Fury Road?

SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Movie audiences appear to be clamoring for movies filled with endless car chases. And with great fury and furiousness. Let s recap.

GREG: In a future world where gas and water are scarce, we re introduced to Mad Max. Max was apparently some sort of police officer who was charged with protecting women and children. We learn this through flashbacks of little girls asking Max  why didn t you save us  in accusatory tones. Max is taken hostage by the wild boys and hung from his heels in a cavern.

SCOTT: We then see Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) secretly steal five breeding wives of the tyrannical and maniacal Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Joe and his henchmen give chase using a strange assortment of battle-equipped vehicles with Max strapped to the hood of War Boy Nux s (Nicholas Hoult) car. Soon Max escapes and joins forces with Furiosa in an attempt to find a way home and to safety.

GREG: Scott, this movie was one long chase scene. There was hardly any time to create a plot. But there is one. Furiosa is trying to get these five young woman back to her homeland - The Green Place. When they arrive the land is dead and the only alternative is to go back where they came from. It s a very basic story, just enough to justify all the car mania. I have to say, though, I was impressed. It s dazzling display of roadwork and a nightmarish vision of the future. Most people I ve talked to were impressed by two things: the guy playing electric guitar on the front of a war vehicle, and how hot Charlize Theron looked despite being hairless and having just one arm.

SCOTT: Greg, Mad Max: Fury Road is a stunning technical and action-adventure achievement. The look of the movie is unlike anything I ve ever seen. The surreal visuals of the characters and their bizarre motor vehicles are simply incomparable. This dystopian vision of humanity s future is disturbing yet creatively appealing. Now, having said that, I was disappointed with the complete lack of character development and storyline. We are never introduced to the main characters. These characters just show up and are being chased, hounded, and tortured by Immortan Joe and his minions. I suppose I should root for them because they seem less dislikeable and bizarre than Joe and his gang, but we have no way of knowing if they are worthy of our support. There simply is no backstory to any of these characters. All we have is one heart-palpitating car chase scene after another. Yes, these chases were fun, but I hoped for much more from a storyline and character development point of view.

GREG: The star of this film was definitely the world created by director George Miller and writers McCarthy and Lathouris. We can only judge the characters by what they do, rather than what they might say. Max spends most of his time in the movie being victimized by others. He shows he s not a bad guy because instead of killing Furiosa when he has the chance, he merely shoots the sand around her. He s not a killer it seems. Later, when he has the chance to go his own way, he instead chases down Furiosa and her clan to convince them they are going the wrong way. Then he helps them to create a plan to return to the Citadel where there is ample food, water, and gas. So, he s a good guy after all, but we can only learn this through his choices rather than anything he says.

SCOTT: I agree that Max and Furiosa follow the arc of the buddy hero story, in that they are two people thrown together who dislike each other at first but slowly develop a strong bond. The villains in this story depart from the usual pattern that we see in the movies, Greg. Usually, the mastermind villain (in this case, Immortan Joe) is a man who calls all the shots from afar, safe from any harm. Only his minions and henchmen come in harm s way. But in this movie, Joe is in on the action in a big way, and he ultimately gets his comeuppance at the end. Overall, the supporting cast is as memorable if not more memorable than our two heroes. This may be the case partly because the two main characters are so poorly developed, but also because the supporting cast members show some depth, not to mention unusual behaviors and vivid makeup and costuming. Props go out to Immortan Joe and Slit as the memorable villains, and to the friends and allies of our two buddy heroes. Specifically, the five breeding women and Nux, the bad-guy-turned-good-guy.

GREG: It s interesting to see the transformation in a secondary character such as Nux. He starts out literally living off of Max s blood and chasing the escaping brides. He s a bad guy being lead by a dark mentor (Joe). But he soon falls in love with one of the brides and becomes one of the good guys. Here is a secondary character who undergoes a moral transformation. In the end he martyrs himself to save Max, Furiosa, and the remaining brides. He is a heroic, redeemed sidekick. I enjoyed Mad Max: Fury Road more than I expected to. Despite the lack of plot I was entertained by the imaginative and detailed dystopian future created by director Miller. I was drawn into the relentless chase and was able to appreciate the transformation of our buddy heroes as well as the sidekick. I give Mad Max 3 out of 5 Reels. While Max and Furiosa don t really create an alliance until the midpoint of the story, it s clear we re witness to a convergent buddy story. Our two heroes couldn t be farther apart at the beginning of the movie. But their common desire to escape the villain Immortan Joe and find a safe place draws them together. I liked this buddy story and gave them 4 out of 5 Heroes. The supporting cast was interesting as well. I ve already talked about the evolution of sidekick Nux. The five brides pretty much played the damsels in distress. Aside from an occasional opportunity to reload guns, their job was to look beautiful and be rescued. The villains were more interesting than usual. Immortan Joe certainly played the classic mastermind villain (although as you point out, Scott, he definitely got his hands dirty). Joe had his own henchman in Slit and countless nameless and faceless minions. But there was a nice addition of three other factions of bad guys, each with their own mastermind villain.Two warring factions came to Joe s aid, and the gas guzzling motorcycle gang chimed in to help our heroes. Sadly, we didn t get much depth to their characters, so I give the supporting cast 3 out of 5 Cast points.  Movie:  Cast:  Hero: 

SCOTT: Mad Max: Fury Road is a visual spectacle and dazzling feast for the eyes and ears. But there is little substance in the form of storyline and character development. If you enjoy the Fast and Furious franchise, you ll enjoy this movie. I ll give this this film credit for being highly memorable in terms of make-up, costuming, cinematography, and visual effects. But I can t give any movie high marks without good meaty characters that we get to know. As a result, I can only award Mad Max: Fury Road 2 Reels out of 5. Our two buddy heroes, Max and Furiosa, were disappointing because we never get to know them. There is no backstory and almost no dialogue whatsoever that can give us insight into their values, their history, or their character. As such, they do not change over the course of the movie, other than they grow to like each other and depend on each other for survival. Let s face it -- this is an action movie that assumes (perhaps correctly) that audiences only want chase scenes. I can only award these two flimsy heroes 1 Hero out of 5. The supporting cast was more interesting than our two heroes. We re not given much insight about Immortan Joe or any backstory, either. But he is obviously a deranged, maniacal cult leader with loads of charisma. Max and Furiosa s friends and allies play a nice supporting role, and as you point out, Greg, Nux is the one character (albeit a supporting character) who undergoes a transformation. I ll agree with your rating and assign this group a rating of 3 Casts out of 5.  Movie:  Cast:   Hero:",NEUTRAL

"Aug 9, 2017","This is my new favorite movie.  The score is one of the best I've heard in my life, and the way it pairs with the visuals takes it to a whole new level.

The caliber of non-verbal acting that Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy achieve is the best I think I'll probably ever see.  The evolution of their characters as they reluctantly come to rely on the other being there is palpable, and the lack of dialogue in the beginning throws that into sharper contrast.

I can see how a die-hard Mad Max fan wouldn't like it because it's not about Max.  But if you let that go and accept it for what it is - an independent story from Mel Gibson's character - you open yourself to a mind-blowing cinematic experience.  

The amount of care and attention to detail in the vehicles and the stunts is very rare in the age of digital enhancement, and you can tell the difference.  The more I learn about this movie, the more I come to respect and appreciate all the scenes.

This is a movie you can watch over and over again, and still not be able to tear your eyes away from the screen.",NEUTRAL

En un futuro post-apocaliptico donde lo único que importa son los vehículos motorizados y la gasolina existe un loco llamada max, un expolicía que es acosado por los vivos y por los muertos entrelaza cu camino con furiosa una chica que planea una rebelión contra inmortal un dictador que tienen a todo su pueblo en la miseria muertos de hambre y sed.
Hablando de lo bueno y de las primeras buenas noticias que supimos desde antes del estreno de la película es que Hiba a ser dirigida por el mismo George Miller, justamente el director de la trilogía original de mad max el cual debo mencionar que mientras más viejo está Miller mejor dirige películas el es la prueba viviente de que la vejes no te vuelve inútil, otro punto muy bueno de la película son los mismos personajes, todos son muy llamativos e interesantes, sobre todo el personaje de furiosa, es increíble y fue un gran acierto el no sexualisarla como lo hacen el 90% de los directores actuales a la hora de hacer un personaje femenino.
El soundtrack es bestial y va muy bien con las escenas y la temática de la película, los efectos especiales son grandiosos de echo no existe el CGI en la película, todo es maquillaje y utilería que le da un toque muy clásico que nos recuerdan a las películas de acción de los 70s, y si está película como toda película de acción tiene explociones cada 5 segundos pero Miller los supo usar de una forma increíble mostrando la vulnerabilidad ante el daño de los personajes, mostrándonos que son humanos, sin duda la saga rápidos y furiosos tiene mucho que aprender de este filme.
Puntos malos: realmente no pude encontrar puntos malos tan así para mencionarles.

Then, you meet the wives, and especially, Furiosa. Soon after you forget that Max is even involved, because all he does is become a near-designated driver and action prop. All of a sudden, Furiosa is some maim character that we didn't ask for, but would have appreciated if the roles of her and Max were reversed.

It's full of fuel, fire, blood, metal, spit and dirt but hey, isn't that Mad Max? And what a turbo reboot it is! The stunts, the editing, the effects are quite exasperating to say the least. When it does let us catch a breath, we are given moments of recollection and storytelling under the expanse of a starry outback sky which are a thing of true cinematic beauty. Max is still a laconic, tortured individual who this time, plays second fiddle to Charlize Theron's equally stoic heroine, but we are given some back story here and there to make up for this.

No idea why this movie is so highly spoken of. This is the most overrated movie of all time. I like the original Mad Max but the movies following were stupid. TOO DAMN MANY ACADEMY AWARDS!

"Apr 3, 2016",Another critically acclaimed movie that was beyond crap.,NEUTRAL
"Apr 3, 2016","First of all 'No', just 'No' this is not a good movie. It's an over the top farce which simply cashes in on a dusty franchise without building on the character, the insanity, or the cunning of Max Rockatansky.

The movie's most interesting aspect is its opening where we get a taste of post apocalyptic life as Max is captured, inked and branded in a nightmarish city run by the evil lord Immortan Joe. The opening scenes feature mutations, deranged drug induced youths, fuel guzzling engines and a people enslaved by the control of water supply in a barren desert landscape.

What happens next is a very sandy two hour car chase, incorporating a desert storm of biblical proportions, a flame throwing guitar, victoria secret virgins, monster trucks, and various gangs which help give pursuit to the increasing escalation of nonsense.

The problem with the movie is that there is no realism, not that it hurts to be removed from reality in a science fiction movie, but what I mean is that the lead characters are indestructible despite several run ins with death throughout the movie. For the first twenty minutes Max is used as a Type O blood bag without so much as receiving a cookie, then he unflinchingly partakes in two hours of truck driving combat. There is no connection to Max or to the female lead Furiosa, we don't know their motives, how they've both wound up at the citadel, where they're going, how they intend to survive, and worse is that we don't feel any empathy for them despite the severe lacerations they receive throughout. Ultimately the characters are sub material to a movie that concentrates on being loud and jam packed with adolescent fantasy. Although the landscape is vast the movie has no depth. There is no tension in the fight scenes, car chases truck, some meaningless extra gets killed, truck gets speared, car blows up, repeat for two hours, charge ten bucks a head, release to DVD.

For me the film fails to fire from both barrels, it's more of a 'Max and his moths' kinda movie than the rage filled road warrior epic I was expecting. My only advice is if you go to see Fury Road don't be afraid to walk, it never gets better, and don't be fooled into thinking it's nearly over, it's not. Just get up off your seat, don't apologise to the idiot beside you, kick them if you must, shout abuse if appropriate, just do whatever it takes to make your way to the green exit sign and go.

Once more Hardy shows us that he is capable of doing seriously fantastic movies and giving us special performance.

"Apr 2, 2016","I saw the original mad max... it was violent, it had car battles, it had minimal character development. I had very realistic expectations going into the theater to see this new version.

Never have I been more disappointed with a movie. The acting on both leads parts was mediocre at best, with the male lead switching from being well spoken to being capable of nothing but grunting.. 

The story line seems to have been written and edited by remedial English students, the characters are unbelievable and seriously lack any character development, it has horrible motorcycle stunts... and guys bouncing back and forth on poles of all things.

and come on.. a flame-throwing guitar and fat women being milked for no explained reason to trade for gasoline to power the flame throwing guitar?... it's full of shitty clichés... badly cut scenes.. and lots of explosions.

There was no character development and even a five minute introduction as they had in Road Warrior would have made the film more interesting. Total social justice warrior agenda and total garbage. Boycott Hollywood! I gave it a 1 star rating on IMBD and am going to go do the same at Rotten Tomatoes. This type of propaganda is just another example of how ideology ruins art.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 1, 2016","From beginning to end, Mad Max: Fury Road is a non-stop, thrilling action film that manages to balance the characterization, effects, and direction of this chaotic dystopia in the most beautiful manner. Two times was the charm for me to be convinced that Mad Max deserved every single piece of acclamation it was getting. Director George Miller created the most engaging, fictional world with the right amount of action, with the perfect cast, and without never overloading the film with too many explosions or special effects.

The main cast, Tom Hardy and (Who would have thought?!) Charlize Theron, are just phenomenal and work perfectly together. While the plot can easily speak on its own, this would've never worked without the right cast. It is impressive how they manage to make a mostly serious movie with extremely small hints of comedy here and there, entertaining and interesting.

Now it is time to praise everything else. Sound and visual effects, production design, cinematography, costumes, makeup, and hair styling. Seriously. When I was talking about having an unexpected perfectly good balance I was not joking. The sound mixing and special effects are truly remarkable, bringing the movie to life and letting you in into the mayhem this world is. The costume, makeup and hair styling, hint at everything each character is, their personalities, and a glimpse at some back-story there is no time to tell within the two hours. And the cinematography directs you to what's important, and you are able to appreciate how involved each scene is.

Mad Max is successful because it manages to turn an insane film, a chaotic film, into one of the best action movies that I have ever seen. Mind you, I am not big on action movies. It is not easy to control and shape this amount of chaos and confusion into a good film. At one point I had to ask myself, is this really an action movie? Because it is so freaking good. Mad Max is just incredibly good.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 1, 2016","The best ""Mad Max"" film and one of the finest, most intense action films in recent memory. Technically impeccable, with a fascinating soundtrack and photography, ""Fury Road"" is also the best-written film of the series. Theron is very good in the role of Furiosa, but the most important asset is the unrelenting, frenzied, exhilarating and in some cases even moving action, be it big-scale chases or impressive fist fights. Brilliantly orchestrated by Miller and never running low on ideas, it's a triumph all-around.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 31, 2016","What a film, what a lovely film!!!

Set in a world where people had finally had enough of 30 indistinguishable superhero films every summer and decided to end it all, 'Fury Road' is a balls-to-the-wall, punk-rock masterpiece that offers an education in tone setting, cinematography, subtle characterisation and mind-blowing action to any would be spandex loving director.

The film is a blistering high speed chase through the Australian outback that never once lets you catch your breath..... and that's really all it is....... except it isn't;

You could count the number of lines of dialogue in this film on one hand and yet it still manages to fully flesh out every single character, we know who they are and what their motivation is, that is an astounding piece of storytelling. The setting for the film is beautiful and Miller masterfully shows us this wasteland rather than tells us about it, unlike a lot of summer blockbusters, this film remembers that cinema is a VISUAL storytelling medium. The action will have to go without saying because you just have to see it to believe it, I lack the vocabulary to truly explain what this film does with its action scenes.

"Mar 27, 2016","Mad Max: Fury Road is iconic action filmmaking released in a time where CGI, F/X, and all other bits of technological visuals have been dominating the Hollywood scene. Director George Miller proves action can still be as exhilarating, unique, and narratively profound through practical effects and by using action as a vessel to his overall story. Fury Road not only demands constant attention to the small, non-verbal narrative details, but also requires some thought process. Viewers should not be surprised if they're still finding details in their third or fourth viewing that they didn't find previously--a feat that many hollow action films should've aimed for. Tom Hardy gives a superb performance in a role Mel Gibson left behind, but it is Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa that steals the screen, and our hearts as one of the more memorable characters in any Mad Max Film. For those who haven't previously seen a Mad Max film, I would definitely encourage them to check out the first and/or second film, but Fury Road can be watched and mostly understood on its own.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 4, 2016","Thirty years is a long time to wait for a new installment in a film franchise, but Mad Max: Fury Road overcomes this problem for a variety of reasons. Firstly, director George Miller simply doesn't care if you're familiar with what's come before. He's also smart enough to forge a path down Fury Road that avoids Reboot Alley, Sequel Street, Prequel Avenue, and Remake Boulevard. This Mad Max is its own movie, which is wildly refreshing. Even more importantly, it's an insane orgy of fire and carnage that contains more originality and vision in its first 15 minutes than did last year's entire summer movie season.

Tom Hardy is the new Max Rockatansky, and we're reintroduced to the road warrior just as he gets picked up by a rabid band of War Boys, the white-skinned lizard-like army that worships the old tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). While Max is being held as a source of blood for sickly War Boys like Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of Joe's most loyal soldiers betrays him. The Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) absconds with Joe's most powerful rig and five of his most desired breeders.

I've already said it, but it bears repeating: It doesn't matter that you don't know what this stuff means. It's all there, and it all makes sense in the context of what's on the screen. By the time Max is hooked, masked, and strung up on the hood of Nux's vehicle, we know everything we need to know about this world, its inhabitants, and their motivations. Why does Furiosa have a mechanical arm? Doesn't matter. What's the deal with all the breast milk? Doesn't matter. Why is there a guy playing a guitar that shoots flames in the midst of all this carnage? Doesn't fucking matter.

That balls-to-the-wall, I-don't-care-what-you-think style of filmmaking is cool, but it also serves a purpose here. It forces you to constantly stay in the moment. These characters don't digress, and they rarely pontificate. Their pasts, fears, and hopes will sometimes define their choices and actions-like Furiosa's decision to take the women away from Joe-but they aren't things that need to be discussed and debated. The thing they're most concerned about is survival, and the thing they're second-most concerned about doesn't exist. That state-of-mind is not just apparent, but tangible in every sweet frame of this movie.

And the actors convey this state-of-mind perfectly. Neither Tom Hardy nor Charlize Theron says much over the course of the film, but they don't need to. They're two of the finest actors of their generation-capable of relaying more with a look than could any amount of words. (With this film, Tom Hardy reclaims the title of best male actor from Joaquin Phoenix in my mind, but we'll see what Irrational Man brings later this summer.) In their eyes are a lifetime of pain and exhaustion, but there's also a fire and a fight that burns as brightly as any explosion we see over the film's two hours.

And there are a lot of explosions, a lot of fire in Mad Max: Fury Road. On Miller's monochromatic desert backdrop, it looks amazing. Perhaps more amazing than the blazing reds and oranges are the night scenes' sumptuous blues. Even in 3D, the film's colors pop spectacularly, and you'll be treated to some eye-popping moments, especially toward the film's finale. (You won't find a better post-conversion than this.) Let's not screw this up; John Seale needs an Oscar nomination here.

I'm not sure where the Mad Max series goes from here, but I don't really care. I'm happy that a film like this can get made today. I'm happy that Miller revived this character to tell an important story that strives to advance the cause of feminism in film. Hell, I'm simply happy that there are people as creative as those behind this movie working in the industry. It's easy to forget that with so much disposable nonsense out there. But this film refuses to go down that road, and the result is something that sets the bar high, not just for the summer of 2015, but for every studio, every filmmaker, every creator.

"Mar 4, 2016","MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is metal as fuck. It's the purest and one of the best straight action films I've seen.

While the film rarely takes a breath during its two hour runtime, the little snippets of characterization provide compelling reasons to root for the heroes, and even sympathize with its villains. Also, while I don't know if you could call it a ""feminist piece"", it handles a surprising wealth of female characters with incredible grace, never falling prey to the genre's most common failings of damseling its women or having them overcompensate with fierce masculinity. In fact, all the colorful characters in the film simply... are. They feel like effortless extensions of the mad world they inhabit. Even the antagonist's crazed henchmen are given proper motivations for their behavior.

"Feb 28, 2016","This movie should have just been named ""Max"" since Tom Hardy was not mad at all. He should have taken lessons from the crazy old lady in the movie who was actually ""mad"". There was no char dev as in the prior Mad Max films either as it was one long, never-ending action scene.

AND I'm not that hard to please. How many films have I watched, well I turn 60 years old in a couple of weeks. Hey, maybe I got out of bed the wrong side today...but really this film is poor. Why? Well the story line is just so pathetically weak. The filming, stunts and action are technically top notch...which given a bottomless pile of cash anyone could do. But  really it's just a great big huge massive crash bang wallop epic car chase in orange sand and rock.  About as subtle and clever as being hit in the mouth with a piece of sandstone.

Tom Hardy and Charlize Therion forged a great alliance to fight eternal Joe, a geriatric villain who returned from Mad Max 1 (36 years ago Toe Cutter the he ran over Mad Max´s wife and baby). Thirty-five years since Mad Max 1, Mad Max 4 has reached cinematic excellence in this modern reboot in all aspects, story, cast, visuals and music.

"Feb 21, 2016","Cruising on a proverbial wave of hype, Mad Max: Fury Road is the first time Mr. Rockatansky has graced our screens since 1985, and it certainly is a thunderous return for the series. Rarely have chase scenes been so exciting, rarely have landscapes looked so gorgeous, and rarely has a colour palette been so varied and striking. By opting to stage practical action sequences with stunt drivers and real vehicles instead of CGI and computer simulations, not only does the action feel more kinetic, it also feels more human. We're seeing real people doing real driving and taking real risks. As it was with the Indiana Jones trilogy, it gives everything a more authentic feel, and proves that special effects are no substitute for human involvement.
With all that said, the story in the movie is where a lot is left to be desired. The characters, while underdeveloped, do interact and co-operate in a believable way, united in the universal quest for survival and freedom, but all of them exist in something of a narrative vacuum. The entire thing is more or less a 2-hour car chase, and while all of these sequences are executed beautifully, they don't really serve a higher purpose. I definitely wouldn't hail it as the best of the series, as many other viewers have done. The political commentary is familiar to anyone who has seen the other MM movies, and Max is, as he was in the second film, relegated to a supporting performance in his own film. But with all that instalment, if you're in it for the action, this movie delivers like no other in recent memory. It could do with being a fair bit meatier, but for the adrenaline junky in all of us, it's more than enough to satisfy our appetites.",NEUTRAL

Bad ass action, amazing effects, a surprisingly engaging plot (considering it's a 2 hour car chase for the most part) make this film AMAZING.  I found myself caring about every single one of the protagonists, no matter how little their screen time or interaction.  Just a masterfully done film.

But what really does it for me?  Every single time I see it, every time I catch it on a movie channel somewhere in the middle, it's still good.  No matter what point I come in or how many times I see it, this movie does not get old.  It is ALWAYS good.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 11, 2016","George Millar's grisly road movie takes an Australian cult hit, and gives it an all-American makeover. Almost.
Loud and proud with little beneath its grisly veneer, Mad Max: Fury Road coughs up the kind of two-and-a-half hour car chase we typically get the from the later Fast and Furious films. But Fury Road gives Hollywood's tired and tested formula a twist - genuine visual flair with sprinklings of dusty nostalgia.
Gorgeously grimy make-up effects give us some of the most meticulous mutants we've seen on screen in years. Yet with next to no mythology or background offered for any of its characters - or even a tangible plot - Fury Road slams on a mental brake long before it starts to pick up speed.
Fury Road is fast, fun and stylistically superb. But, for all it's merits, it'll only ever be enjoyed in a ""what the hell did I just watch"" kind of way.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 5, 2016","In my opinion the best of the entire franchise! Mad Max: Fury Road will blow you away with its action sequences and visuals. People complain that the storytelling and character handling is weak. I disagree because this film is visual storytelling and George Miller handles it so well. Tom Hardy is great as Max even though I prefer Mel Gibson, Tom Hardy still pulls it off very well. However, Charlize Theron stole the show! She was brilliant in the film and a great character. One of the best action movies ever made! Go see this film now or you are doing a disservice!",NEUTRAL
"Feb 5, 2016","I couldn't stop re playing how Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, George Miller action and speech in the movie. The developed culture and post apocalypse politics in the movies really really exhilarating and vivid and realistic. Each blood scene or even the drop of water on the floor render a huge impact of the complication of the envionment and each character use their best and the most simple way to show the brutal side of humanity and the other side.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 4, 2016","A transfer of the original idea in Australia to America had the old electrical posts that are being changed out to cylinder shape shows the lack of foreseeing a design change and ultimate progress. Having a main character Imperator Furiosa, a female when the original Mad Max had all males in main roles was a good choice with the idea that females in main characters draw the females to see movies that are not just all male within an usual male action and story with high violence. Even in fiction, women in history have been denied their strength in a violent world that if there is peace and quiet. There is thankfulness. Near the end of the movie, one character of Immortan Joe's Wives prays, ""To anyone who will hear.""",NEUTRAL
"Feb 4, 2016","Amazing production design, beautifully shot, lacks a bit of depth, and I got kind of tired of the day-for night shooting. Charlize Theron was good in it, and Tom Hardy did his best to keep his face still while wiggling his eyes around Mel Gibson style, but I just didn't really feel like he was the same character. Bonus points for including a group of women warriors that were cool and believable. It builds off of the 2nd and 3rd movies but seemed to forget the first (maybe I'm forgetting a mention or flashback to his family or his memories of civilization). Maybe that just showed how far away civilization as we know it was in the past. The part about not knowing what a tree was was pretty cool. The acting was o.k. Basically this movie is just a lot of screaming and fighting with an array of inventive post-apocalyptic technology. Dirty white people screaming and killing each other in fantastic ways. They tried to humanize Mad Max by giving him PTSD, but I didn't really see the need to go in to detail about his madness, just wind him up and let him go it's a pulp movie!",NEUTRAL
"Feb 3, 2016","Every year there's that film that comes out of nowhere and simply kills it. Last year it was Guardians of the Galaxy for me, even thought it was hyped plenty, it still surprised me. Mad Max: Fury Road might be that film for this year.  It's almost always better to know as little as possible about movies before going in. For Mad Max I couldn't have even told you it was supposed to be set in the future. I only knew it was a Mel Gibson trilogy from the early 80's. What a ride, Mad Max is one of the best action films I've seen in a long time. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, it's out there, but it's a great film. Tom Hardy is supposedly contracted for more films, and if they are as good as Fury Road, I'll be there to see them.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 30, 2016","Let me preface this by saying I'm not a fan of Mad Max. I was bored in Mad Max and was almost bored in The Road Warrior.

I was underwhelmed. I heard all of the hype about how Mad Max: Fury Road was one of the greatest movies ever made and how it's a cinematic masterpiece. About how it gives you a rush and sometimes you need a break just to slow your heartbeat. 

I honestly don't get it.

Maybe the hype behind the movie is what I see when I see Fury Road. What I see when I watch Fury Road is something that is just all spectacle. Is the action good to look at. You're damn right it is. The car carnage of the wasteland is incredible to look at. There's a guy with a flamethrower guitar! But that's not what I want to stand out the most when I see a movie.

The main thing I look for when I'm watching a movie like this a a combination of exciting and engaging action, as well as a good story. This movie lacks the story part because it is too simple. There is not a lot about the wasteland and it's inhabitants that makes me interested about them. How did Furiosa get that arm? How did Imorton Joe rise to power? Who were those people that Max was haunted by? Who were those people on the sticks? There is no context given so I'm not interested and do not care. Is Furiosa a badass? Yes! But as cool as that is I don't care about her because I know so little.

In summation Mad Max: Fury Road is all spectacle and nice to look at, but really nothing else.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 24, 2016","One of my favorite movies of this year, and possibly of all time!!! This movie was stylistically and visually beautiful. There was some really great world-building in this movie, and I love the subtly incorporated Viking/Nordic cultural influences in the Mad Max post-apocalyptic universe. I actually wasn't a huge fan of Tom Hardy, and likewise was also not blown away by Charlize Theron or any of the other acting in this movie. However, this movie was so beautiful, I couldn't resist giving this movie a resounding 5/5 stars!",NEUTRAL
"Jan 24, 2016",Mad Max was a weirdly entertaining and action packed ride. The symbolism and story telling was fascinating. I just wish there was less car chase,NEUTRAL
"Jan 24, 2016","I found this movie to be incomprehensible and stupid - rescued to the two star level only by its stunning art design.

Supposedly this is some ""post apocalyptic"" world we're in, but there is no back story presented to create any context for the characters or their motivations.  Mad Max gets kidnapped and strapped to the front of a vehicle, and we watch cars blow each other up.  There's not that much more going on - until maybe 60% into the movie when the Charlize Theron character explains she's trying to get back home - and eventually needs to return to where the movie started.

There are bizarre kings and crazed punks and a few siren slaves whose presence appears, again with little context.  People spray themselves with paint, one truck has a wonderful rock guitarist strapped to the front, whose axe shoots flames out of its neck.  And this goes on for two and a quarter hours.

However, the way the visuals are conceived is stunning.  The home city has mammoth levels strung on hyper-industrial styled gears, with muscular percussionists pounding out something - for some reason.  It looks cool.  But to no intelligent end.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 24, 2016","As far as action films go, this is hands down one of the best of all time in my book. Nothing can amount to the fast-paced action. And for today's standards, with so many companies relying on cgi stuff, it is amazing to see a director/film finally taking the bold step to make an action film the good ole fashioned way, with real stunts and actors. George Miller really knocked this one out of the park. Not to mention a great performance by Hardy & Theron.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 16, 2016","Fury Road illustrates how far the Mad Max story has evolved or devolved as this viewer would attest. Upstream, the first Mad Max was a unique & exhilarating dystopian nightmare of a semi-horrific road rage film encapsulating the raw brutishness of the Australian collective consciousness of the 1970s. Remember it wasn't made that long after Aboriginal First nations peoples gained the right to vote. And then truck engine sized cars roamed the Aussie roads where roadside eucalyptus trees had big American copies of GM and Ford cars wrapped around the trees making them look like tinsel on Aussie Christmas trees set in the blinding heat and dust of the outback. One could be forgiven for feeling like being in A George Miller film even outside the cinema in the Australian reality of the time. Fury Road has a Jerry Bruckheimer-ish feel to it with Australian models who act like a gang of bangers from Zoolander walking down the catwalk with David Bowie wincing at their garish Derelict Ozzie-style clothing. But the film has somehow captured an audience who seeks solace in a cinema from the ever-present real thrills and spills of the dominant paradigm of daily worldwide terrorism events.",NEUTRAL

The story arc is simple- not necessarily a bad thing in an action movie- but the actions of virtually every character is so far off the believability track it quickly becomes a jumbled mess. The director was more obviously more interested in creating a visually stunning string of intense scenes than a good story.  Should have been cut down to a seven minute music video.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 14, 2016","Rating this movie is hard for me because I completely don't get the whole Mad Max thing.  I tried with the older movies since they were highly reviewed and was bored with them and tried the updated version after having it in my queue \ for two months and was bored with it too.  Yes the visuals are fantastic, Charlize Theron is fantastic of course, but I just couldn't get past how shallow and silly the whole premise of it all is.  Sure, there are some ironies there and as a popcorn flick for the masses it is not exactly difficult to follow. I just can't do it and despite the manic action sequences I was bored and as soon as they said they were going all the way BACK to where they started I was out.  I simply do not have the patience to go through all of that nonsense in reverse and could care less how it ended.  I rate the story at like maybe a half star but gave it 3 because Charlize's screen presence mixed with the high budget style and CGI is worthwhile just to look at despite the story line.  I can't forget to mention Nicholas Hoult, who has officially sealed his title as World's Most Endearing Zombie.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 13, 2016","Quite a shock when I saw the super high rating for this movie. Yes, there were spectacular locations and outstanding chase scenes, but that's it. Bacially, the movie was just one continuous chase scene w/a explosion fest thrown in for good measure. What's missing? Well, a damn story for starters. Very weak at best, with so little character development it left gaping holes in the whole escape from the tyrannical bad man scenario.

Another glaring omission, was no Australian actors! This apocalyptic world of Mad Max is suppose to be in Australia. I guess the Casting Director went out for drink when these actors were chosen. Bad idea. All American accents, and NO Aussies. Maybe for this flick, it didn't make much difference as there is so little dialog between actors and their weak-ass story. Non-stop chase scenes w/gratuitous killing gets a bit stale w/o a decent story to fill-in. Under The Thunderdome quality it ain't there by a long shot.   BTW, I am a BIG Mad Max fan, but this re-boot misses the mark for me.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 12, 2016","WHAT A LOVELY DAY, INDEED. this movie is everything the trailers made it look like it would be - a totally insane thrill ride roller coaster of a film from start to end.

The film opens with revving car engines, the perfect prelude to the smashing, racing, crashing action you're about to see. The casting is pretty awesomely perfect, and Tom Hardy's demeanor fulls up the pages of script he doesn't talk through.

A few big takeaways: obviously, the action and stunts were breathtaking. If there's a film out there that makes a better case for practical stunts and effects, I haven't seen it. Everything in this movie is based around real explosions, real crashes, and the interaction with the physical environment, therefore you end up with an incredible scale of thought and detail put into the reasons for everything and some pretty amazing visuals to accompany the story. Another thing is the extreme visualism with which George Miller has brought back to Mad Max is absolutely stunning; it creates amazing editing and action that is so in your face but at the same time easy to follow and understand. Finally, the soundtrack almost never leaves and, while loud and crazy, sets its paces and sticks with the action incredibly well. The movie is even self-aware about it's music, pairing it with a specific vehicle in the film that forces the viewer to be reminded about the music playing and brings it to light constantly, but not so much as to distract.

As with most, there's also an incredible feminism empowerment plotline to the story that shines, but doesn't feel forced. There's just strong and powerful female characters that kick all the ass, straight and simple. There's no reason why or why not, and that's what all movies and filmmakers should take as a huge lesson from Fury Road.

Definitely make a point to get to the theater for this one - a small screen will GUARANTEED not do the action justice. I'll be seeing it in IMAX next week, which I would also recommend.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 9, 2016","This is what happens when you have a visionary filmmaker with an idea in his head for 30 years. A film so energetic, so well-oiled and with a story that moves along faster than Max's own Interceptor that you just want to keep going back in over and over again once its finished. The first thing I love about it is Miller's direction. He almost completely does away with the shaky-cam fight scenes of recent action films and now, finally, we have someone who knows when to employ what technique. When to use slow motion (or when to go fast motion), when to cut to maintain suspension of disbelief but also to keep the viewers understanding of the scene and all its players intact. Miller also accomplishes something extraordinary with the characters of the film - here we have fully fleshed out, three dimensional characters but with barely a word of dialogue. Characters are developed as we see the world they live in. We feel for Nux because at the start he is just cannon fodder, unremarkable when standing next to the other warboys (A surprisingly easy thing to relate to in the real world). We feel for Furiosa because she has made it through so many implied hardships and has come out fighting on the other side. The character of Max is already developed fully through the canon of the original films, but Miller recreates this character by showing us his past through his fevered hallucinations, so the film works as a standalone piece as well as a part of the canon. Something else this film has received noteworthy praise for is its female leads, and personally I have yet to see a film do this as well as this one does. Yes, the female characters in this film are in the foreground and are all holding their own with the men, but it never addresses this, it just lets them do their thing, almost as if - could it be possible - woman can be proactive too??!",NEUTRAL

I watched it originally in the theater a week, or two, into it's release and I knew that it would easily be one of my favorite films of the year (especially considering how few new films I watch in their year of release). 

The bottom line is that the story is more important than the vehicle. It is an incredible action film and marrying the story with the action is important and it's main strength but I am suggesting that the action/chase movie is could be bigger. There is little time spent on building relationships between the characters and the viewer. Now is a good time to remember that I prefer drama films so this could be the perfect feminist action film and I may not recognize how perfect it is.

I waited to watch it a second time because I wanted to have a better sound system which I now have. The first time one of the diesel engine turns over it sounded perfect and then I turned the base down; I could feel the nails shaking loose.

"Dec 30, 2015","The surprise smash hit of 2015, Mad Max: Fury Road is a sequel/reboot to George Miller's Mad Max (1979). What's strange about Miller is that apart from his Mad Max franchise his biggest accomplishments have been writing both Babe and Happy Feet. Very peculiar then that from the same director comes literally the most action packed film of the last decade. Unfortunately however this very strength becomes its greatest weakness.

Whilst visually stunning there is barely a narrative driving the action foreword. The story goes that in a post apocalyptic wasteland, where chrome and oil are worshipped and water is in short supply, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) decides to run away from Immortal Joe, the man in charge of said chrome, oil and water, taking all of his 'wives' with her. That's essentially it, what follows next is a two hour long car chase. Somehow this Max character (Tom Hardy) tags along for the ride and apart from being able to drive in a straight line and being nifty with a wrench doesn't really add much.

Theron's Furiosa is amazingly bad-ass and the only really likeable character. It's worth mentioning that it's great to see a strong female lead in an action film such as this. Hardy's Max on the other hand barely says ten words and doesn't really feel justified as the titular character. Nicholas Hoult gives an unrecognisable performance as Nux a young 'war boy' but any real hope of a character arc, for him and nearly all characters, is sacrificed in place of crane cam shots of exploding vehicles.

The mostly practical visual effects are amazing to behold and Miller should be applauded for his return to physical effects and sparse use of green screen. It's visually stunning but only remains interesting for so long. Coming in at exactly two hours it felt at least half an hour too long. When Max and friends finally escape their pursuers I thought it was over and the perfect ending point, however this was not the case. They make the decision to return through the desert from where they came to confront their captor. At this point I felt cheated, not only were all the previous car chases pointless now there was to be another half hour of exactly the same.

Fury Road is an amazing technical achievement and should be recognised as such but unfortunately in order to uphold this, narrative and character development are sacrificed.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 30, 2015",Excellent! Lots of action!,NEUTRAL
"Dec 29, 2015","15 year old production hiatus, drastic changes in shooting locations, cast revamp. The fact that Mad Max Fury Road, the 4th installment of a long forgotten but highly revered franchise was made braving all these odds is nothing short of an incredible event in the recent movie history. And oh yes it's a sight to behold.
Fury road takes us back to the arid dystopia which auteur George miller introduced about 35 years ago. Only now Miller has upped his game by several notches. Thanks to the massive $ 150 mn budget and creative freedom conferred on the creators by the studio.  Landscapes are brighter,  more dreadful, vehicles bigger and more revved up, the mad madder. Enter Immortan Joe, a ghoulish dictator/self-proclaimed messiah who has taken over an entire citadel by stealing its water supply.  Under his wing is an army of ailing  skinheads called the 'War Boys' who have been promised slots in Valhalla in exchange for suicidal fanaticism towards Joe and his ideas.  This works very well given the downcast society where everyone is looking for redemption . Status quo turns into bedlam when Joe's army imperator, Furiosa (Played by the dazzling Charlize theron) goes rogue after stealing Joe's most prized possessions, his wives during a supply run. What ensues is a long exhilarating, chase sequence between furiosa and Joe accompanied by his army of white minions. Thrown in the midst of all this chaos is Max Rockitanksy who is picked as a human power cell by Nux, a starry eyed war boy for his pursuit on fury road. While max was rigged with ample gadgetry in the previous movies he is stripped down to one single instinct, that of survival (The Famous interceptor is shredded between two giant trucks in one of the scenes).  Against will he is forced to help furiosa and the wives flee to a safe haven called the green place. Lean plot? Yes. Shallow? Definitely not.
	Amidst all the edge of the seat action sequences it is easy to miss the subtexts which the writers have carefully interlaced with the main story line. While the original script was slated as one long chase sequence, it became denser with time like a bottle of aging wine. Furiosa's missing arm (the elephant in the room), freakish figures scavenging swamps, Max's strange time hopping visions might all be part of a bigger universe whose surface was merely grazed in fury road. We will have to wait for the promised sequels to watch these elements unfold. (Yes there are more movies in line).
	At the helm of the movie is a mastermind who has crafted his art of direction over years. While he might be pretty inconsistent in making movies George Miller's devotion and bravura puts most his younger contemporaries to shame. Millers uses his outlandish creativity and visceral filmmaking style to make some of the most unforgettable action sequences ever made. Oscar winning cinematographer John Seale (The English patient) who came out of retirement for the project delivers with some stunning shots of Namibian Desert. The art direction and production design are equally stellar. Be it the adorable tumors on Nux's neck , the super cool skeleton engraving on the war rigs door or suave interiors of Immortal's Elysium , the amount of detail that has gone into each character, vehicle or set piece is simply staggering. (Check out the vehicle gallery on the official movie to know what I'm talking about). It would be a sin not to mention Margaret Sixel who puts her editing skills to to make the entire movie look like one long thrilling chase sequence.  Junkie XL's operatic score works as a perfect complement to the mood of the movie. 

But the real stars of the movie in my opinion is its stunt crew. It is incredible and admirable how these guys pulled off a majority of death defying, jaw dropping, and plain batshit crazy stunts with real people and real vehicles instead of doing it the easy way. War boys, polecats, flamers would all have stayed as concepts had it not been for their raw calculated gutsiness.  My adulation goes for the entire stunt team.  This is analog movie making at its best. If you didn't see this on the biggest loudest screen, you definitely missed something.
	One of the biggest surprises of Fury Road was how the movie was not about Max but Furiosa, a warrior equally or more broken than the titular character (We see what you did there with the deceiving trailers, WB). Deeply conflicted and often poignant she tries to bring sense to a mad society. Played flawlessly by Charlize Theron, Furiosa is easily one of the strongest female characters to emerge out of an action flick. She is definitely among the ranks of Ellen Ripley, Sarah Conor and likes. Replacing Mel Gibson is a more reticent, feral, Tom Hardy who gets the job done but becomes subdued by Furiosa's intense screen charisma. Nicholas Hoult also puts a heartfelt performance as Nux, a rather demure war boy and Hugh Kayes Byrne as the nefarious yet graceful antagonist. 

Against all the praises I have heard some strong criticisms about the apparent feminist undertones of the story, but I wonder does it really matter? At heart Fury Road is a straight up action flick with beautifully choreographed stunts, minimal dialogues, strong characters and a seemingly linear storyline. There is no subtle way to put it. Fury Road is every adrenaline Junkies dream come true. If road warrior is the punk's Sistine chapel, Fury road is summer action flick's Holy Grail .",NEUTRAL

"Dec 29, 2015","To let you know I had not watched the original Mad Max movies when I had watched this film, so my judgment comes from the film on its own basis, and using that fact I must saw that George Miller does a good job as far as the cinematography of it. John Seale, the cinematographer, does a exceptional job here. There are many shots of the film that feel like the belong here. John Seale also did some of the Harry Potter movies were he also did a great job in. The action is directed to perfection and left me in awe struck at the amount of time and special effects put into this film with no cgi being added to boggle it down. 

As for characters Tom Hardy is good as Max. He hardly says a word and I really love that when watching the film. I loved that he was all about action and doing stuff and not so much about talking, because a lot of times in the movies just your facial expressions can say so much about a scene, and Tom Hardy was no exception. The fact of the matter is that he was undoubtedly Max. 

Now Charlize Theron I adored as Furiosa. She was what won the movie for me and made it awesome. I still remember after seeing this film the first thing I thought was ""Dam she could be a great Wonder Woman."" I mean seriously forget Gal Godat and get Charlize to play Diana, and bet I would love it along with everyone else. I mean the woman really does lead these women from the terrible and crooked husband. 

Nicholas Hoult and Hugh Keays-Byrne sadly were not as good or interesting. I mean they were just raging fits of anger. They didn't think and they had no brain. I mean really they were not compelling villains at all. In fact I found myself quite bored with them to the point were it didn't make any sense. 

Now with that being said I am going into all the problems with this film. 

The lack of story- While there were interesting characters it lacked any type of good characters which hinders the film quite a bit for me cause I do like a good story. That being said there is some story here unlike what people are saying it just takes some time to get to it

The entire first 20 mins were boring- I mean at first I was into it, but it felt like the action sequence would just keep going and going and honestly if it wasn't for my desire to finish my food I probably would have gone to sleep. Not good movie. Not good at all. 

The villains suck!!!- No really they do. There bad and awful villains to the point were I wanted them all dead. __ OK now that the issues are out the way the film is still decent enough. I won't be recommending it to anyone probably unless there just really into action films tho. Still tho there is a lot that we can still love with Mad Max: Fury Road which is why I am still giving it a 7/10.",NEUTRAL

Tom Hardy, who I like very much, had a hard time stepping out of the shadow of older Maxes who shall not be named, yet held my attention well. But:
1. It seemed that F & M were a perfect match. Why didn't they actually hit it off?
2. The ritual of the ""culture"" was WAY overdone. There's value in ritual, especially for ""primitive"" cultures like that into which civilization had devolved in the movie; but beyond a certain point, ritual becomes a survival risk.
3. Why didn't Furiosa speak Aussie?

Few directors have the tenacity to unleash the kind of physical carnage Miller splashes across the screen here.

"Dec 22, 2015","Having never seen a Mad Max film in it's entirety (I know..), and having heard of its strangeness, as someone put it, I went into Mad Max Fury road a little, well, unsure. But, suffice to say, it was good. Very good. 

The first 20 minutes or so are, to be frank, the weakest part of the movie. Its slow, somewhat uninteresting and as a newcomer its admittedly a little hard to get on board with the madness (pun not intended). But as the movie progresses, um, yeah, so......

The action is sensational. This is one of the best action movies I've seen, and its weird how one and a half hours of action can greatly sustain your interest.
Tom Hardy as Max was brilliant and so was Charlize Theron as Furiosa, and the setting was prettey sublime. There were a few things that bothered me though. One, was that Nicholas Hoult's character, whilst a great character, had a romance with some girl which blossomed in about 3 minutes, and I'm not even exaggerating.

Also there was admittedly a lot of screaming and nothingness in terms of plot. But, honestly, by the time the film concluded, I had the biggest, happiest grin on my face in a long while.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 21, 2015","Believe the hype. Max is back and he's kicking ass. While Tom Hardy isn't quite as good at being Mad Max as Mel Gibson was (srsly, Gibson is a raging bigot. He's already mad), he has the look and his terse acting actually helps him sell his traumatized road warrior persona. Charlize Theron is the woman of the hour as Furiosa, a badass warrior woman out to redeem herself. The plot begins with Max being captured and Furiosa making off with some precious goods that Immortan Joe, the ruler of The Citadel, can't let slip away. Max is serving as a ""blood bag"" for Nux, a Warboy with terminal cancer. Nux figures chasing down Furiosa is his last chance at immortal glory, so he drags Max along for the ride. Thus, the chase begins.

Every character cast for this film is pretty much perfection. If you remember the bizarre characters from Road Warrior, you'll recognize similar horrors and mutants here. The world is dead and irradiated, so there's plenty of twisted creations all around. The gangs themselves are all very well-defined, as are their leaders (I loved the Guntown dude's vehicle). The music is fantastic, and the environments are legit video game-quality otherworldly (the storm sequence and the swamp were particularly awesome). The action as a whole puts the end chase in Road Warrior to absolute shame, which is a tall order but one that Fury Road fulfills.

My only issues with the movie were that the 3D stuff was overdone, the movie should have been an hour longer (I still prefer 3-hour movies for films that aspire to real art), and some leaps in logic (apparently everyone in the post-apocalypse has the same blood type). But those things aside, Fury Road is well worth the price of admission. Action movies will be compared to this for a long time to come.",NEUTRAL

Now, those are what makes this bearable, if you can get past the ridiculous story, ridiculous premise, etc... To be honest? Perhaps it is a cultural thing. As an Asian, I just can't seem to understand why would anyone think up of such a ridiculous post-apocalyptic future. Perhaps this is what happens to white men when the world goes awry.

EDIT: I changed this from 2 stars to 4.5 after watching it a couple more times. I think it really is about getting past the premise. This is not meant to be a serious film, just an action packed science fiction. Also, reading up on more of the pre-stories helped understand a lot of misconceptions in the film.",NEUTRAL

The cinematography for this film is an absolute marvel- showcasing the sprawling outback desert through hues of oranges and reds during the daytime, contrasting it with beautiful midnight blues at night. All this comes together to give the movie a very lively atmosphere. The score alleviates the sense of rush and is smartly used diegetically as well as non-diegetically. The action scenes are shot brilliantly with minimal special effect, furthering its case as a masterpiece. Finally the acting especially that of Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa is top-notch and no character is left needing further characterisation. Tom Hardy's Max is a man of little words, but the performances are so strong that the movie doesn't need dialogue in order to flourish.

"Dec 16, 2015","George Miller burst onto the cinematic landscape in 1979 with the 70's exploitation car chase masterpiece Mad Max then exceeded the brilliance of that debut with a sequel (Mad Max 2) that truly cemented him as a visionary and visceral filmmaker. Now, almost thirty-five years later, Miller demonstrates with Mad Max: Fury Road that he's lost none of his vitality; however, where previously the thinness of plot and character felt appropriate in this franchise, here they read as omission and highlight the fact that at the end of the day this is little more than a well-executed two-hour car chase.

Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is the true hero of this story. Despite living in the aggressively patriarchal society of the Citadel ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) she has attained a position of some authority. When she sets out on a trade mission she takes with her a group of Immortan's breeders with the intention of seeking refuge in a remote society of women. Max (Tom Hardy), spends the first half hour of the film held captive as a human blood bag for one of Immortan's goons until he escapes and teams up with Furiosa.

Miller's strong point is the detail with which he paints his world. The colours, the costumes, the makeup, the souped up vehicles, the dare-devil stunts, the magnificent collisions, the heavy metal guitarist screeching out the pursuit's soundtrack. It's riveting stuff. Imaginative and witty. And as an exercise in action direction it's pretty flawless. But the film aspires to being more than a thrilling roller coaster ride. It asks us to care. And on this level it falls short.

We learn in the opening scene that Max failed to protect his wife and daughter and so (groan) there are subsequent snippets of his daughter haunting him throughout the film. The breeders are all so damn beautiful (including super model Rosie Huntington Whiteley) and given little chance to develop individually that their shared plight is easy to dismiss. The developing bond between Furiosa and Max thankfully doesn't end with a kiss but nor is it of much consequence. Nicholas Hoult, as one of Immortan's gang, has a defined arc in the story which only makes you wonder why him and no one else?

Theron, with her buzz cut, racoon eyes and prosthetic arm, makes a fine action heroine. Hardy, similarly, has just the right brooding presence (and pouty lips) to more than comfortably fill Mel's boots. They look great together and I wish they were given more to do than drive from A to B and back again. Another subplot, another significant complication would've been welcome meat on these narrative bones. Fury Road is indeed audacious and thrilling but you'll come away affected far more by Miller's virtuosity than the film itself.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 15, 2015","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is completely unique. Its visual appeal and creativity can't be denied, but it is also one of the strangest films that you will ever experience.  In a market where every genre is saturated with films that recycle the same concepts and ideas, it is rare to find a film as unique as this one.  It even feels unique when compared with the ""Mad Max"" films of the 80's.  George Miller is no stranger to the film industry and ""Fury Road"" may be his masterpiece.  I think that it is really cool that Miller wrote a new chapter into his series 30 years after the last film.  Most of this story is told without dialogue.  The action is constant and the imagery drives the story for better or for worse (we will never forget the brief milking scene or the idea of a ""blood bag"").  Immortan Joe's mask is terrifying and the production team convincingly transformed all of the actors into nuclear holocaust survivors.  I appreciated the performances by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, though any sort of emotion seems to be overshadowed by the previous and next action sequence.  This one won't be winning any Oscars in acting categories, but it will certainly make a run in categories like Production Design, Film Editing, and Sound Editing.  To be honest, I was a little bit disappointed with the film.  It had so much hype for its entire theatrical run, augmented by a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 97%, and I just did not receive the amount of character development as I expect from a critically acclaimed film.  Still, I will be the first to admit that I need to see it again to process everything that happened and may adjust my rating afterward.  My wife and I are still scratching our heads about the electric guitar guy (who we have discovered is named ""The Doof Warrior"").  We assumed that he was symbolic or sort of reference to the original films, but apparently he is exactly what he appears to be: a flame-spewing guitarist who pumps up the rest of the troops.  I suppose that he left a big enough impression that he is the only character that I have discussed.  The most well-written character in the film is Nux and we grow attached to him because he undergoes the greatest transformation.  I look forward to watching this film again and believe that the sequels will be even better if they deliver the same amount of action while including a greater transformation of their characters.  There are a lot of cheesy sci-fi films from the 70's and 80's that involve vehicles (""Death Race 2000"" is the first one that comes to mind), but the vehicles are perfectly incorporated into this film's creative atmosphere and they are just cool.  Everybody loves ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" for its creative post-apocalyptic story and constant stream of action.  I believe that the Academy Awards will acknowledge its effort and remind the film industry that action films can blow our minds with more than just the action.",NEUTRAL

The complexity of its action scenes and their individual, often awe-inspiring shots alone aren't the film's only attributes, however. Making beautiful use color in its dessert landscapes, incredible locale and vehicle design, and a perfect use of pacing -- especially in the kinetic energy of action scenes -- director George Miller and his team create something that doesn't really come along often. As much praise as other ""artistic"" action films like The Dark Knight receive, that example doesn't even come close to the skill on display in the conception and editing of Max's set pieces.

"Dec 14, 2015","Could one of the best films of 2015 be a sequel to a movie from the 1970s featuring amazing chases, swashbuckling action, all connected through a distinct mythology and set in a time that seems too fantastic to be real? The crazy answer is ""yes, yes it can"" and the funny thing is I'm not talking about that little film with Star Wars in the title. Since the 1979 original, writer/director (and doctor) George Miller has given the world two other iterations of Mad Max-1981s The Road Warrior and 1985s Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (whom George Ogilvie shared a co-directing credit)-but this newest take proves an old vehicle can learn many new tricks with 2015s Mad Max: Fury Road-a legitimate candidate to be one of the most influential films currently made. With a plot told almost exclusively through visual storytelling, Miller and his staff have truly outdone themselves with what the cinematic medium can do-driving from one scene to the other with frenetic pacing, inspired use of editing (which it should win an Oscar with) and subtle yet dramatic acting from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Hardy and Theron-playing main protagonists Max Rockatanksy and Imperator Furiosa, respectively (you have to love names like that)-epitomize the brawn and finesse of Miller's filmmaking aesthetic. Amid the brutal carnage of the chases there is a chaotic fluidity to it all that evokes a beautiful dance-blending music and movement to please the senses. This level of sophistication has been hinted at in the previous films, often with socially sensitive issues that evoked the times they were made in. With real-world oil shortages in the 70s being a major headline, the preservation and fight for gasoline was at the focal point in the original three. This has now been replaced with the preservation of life, an inspired and logical way to go, showing the value of conscious awareness and preserving this place called home; Earth (similar themes were touched upon in Miller's 2006 Oscar-winning film Happy Feat). The underlining theme of survival (that spans each entry) is representative of what Mad Max: Fury Road is-a film that breathes life, has a ""never say die attitude"" but expresses the limitless freedom and determination of what people can achieve.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 13, 2015","Loud, proud, and yet relentlessly incoherent, Mad Max: Fury Road is a disaster of a film masquerading as bold. A reboot, at least of sorts, of the franchise previously headlined by Mel Gibson, director George Miller brings the outlandish post-apocalyptic world back to the screen. We find Max (Tom Hardy) captured at the hands of a crazed war lord, only to find himself mixed up in the escape of the vaunted female Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and the Warlord's many prized wives. 

Those that are prone to like Mad Max will point to the action scenes as proof of the film's inventive and unabashedly brutal nature. To a large extent this is true, the film does look good, and the action sequences feature uniquely conceived devices, feel impactful, and are extremely well choreographed and otherwise executed. Mad Max, to be sure, can be fun to watch. This is all fine until the point in which one dares to ask, 'what am I watching'?

Simply put, Mad Max is an absolute narrative mess. Very little is explained, only the thinnest most idiotic delivered exposition is ever given, and then the sole purpose is to set up a 10 or 15 minute fight or chase scene, meanwhile leaving any characterization, plot, or coherent narrative structure in the dust. Big vehicles blowing up are good, eyes being gouged out-that's great, but in order to constitute a movie there needs to be some semblance of a storyline, some reason for us to be invested in the characters. 

The script deficiencies don't stop at a lack of storytelling, the dialogue is extremely sparse and quite literally dumbed-down. It feels as if it's penned by a behavior disorder fifth grader trying to be naughty during language arts. Utter nonsense comes out of characters with inexplicable motivations, histories, or personas. 

One might think the film's cast, featuring Charlize Theoron and Tom Hardy would be a saving grace. Talented actors as they are, they are adrift in a film that wallows in absurdity and disorganization. Neither actor is developed, and one must ask, why Max had the honor of the film's title? The character of Max in this film is relegated to that of a side character, and a rather uninteresting one at that. The reasons for this are curious and perhaps politically motivated but, regardless, it was a dumb one. Hardy is an incredible talent and to have him so underutilized is perhaps one of the greatest cinematic crimes of 2015. 

Outrageously terrible.

"Dec 7, 2015","This movie is fantastic.  Mad Max Fury Road feels like it just gulped down a case of 5 hour energy shots all condensed into two hours.  To say it is a thrill ride would be an understatement.  There is one 5-10 minute scene of the movie where you can catch your breath when they are stopped and trying to figure out where to head, and that is it.  The entire movie from the opening second to the finish is packed with non stop fast moving action.  Even if you have no idea who the character is or what this movie is about, give it a shot if you are looking for a great action movie.  There really isn't too much dialogue at all to talk about.  Just know that Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are both really good.  And I commend both of them for not being afraid to be part of a movie like this.  Some big name actors might find it silly to accept a role in a movie like this with George Miller directing.  A 2 hour car chase war with these elaborate man made put together vehicles, it is absolutely awesome to see.  You keep waiting to see what the next gang of bandits has in store for the main characters as they are driving across this deserted landscape.  It is a downright fun movie with amazing action throughout, surely one of the best movies of the year.  God forbid it gets any Oscar attention though, the academy I'm sure is ""above"" picking films like this, even though they deserve it.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 7, 2015","Looks more like a lavish TV children's cartoon than an actual film, very fake and unconvincing CGI. Some of the action is dramatic and involving, but none of the story or characters are, and the scenes set outside of the vehicles are a dumb disaster. Nearly two hours long, nothing more than two or three sniggers to recommend it, and not a trace of intelligence at all.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 7, 2015","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Some nice special effects, but such a lack of story line that if i hadn't been with friends i would have walked out of the movie theatre. Charlize Theron like always was an amazing actress, and Tom Hardy fulfilled his role, but they could be out doing much better movies, their performance id the only thing that occasionally made this movie watchable. But please don't waste your precious time on this, it is a pointless, senseless jumble of special effects.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 6, 2015","Does Mad Max: Fury Road have little backstory - and an extremely basic plot? Yes. Does the film reduce its title character to a mere secondary status? Yes. Are there bizarre scenes? Tons. Does Tom Hardy mumble and grunt most of the film? You bet.

But all of that is inconsequential to the fact that Fury Road is one of the most visually stunning, engrossing, and glorious films of the year. In an age of overuse of CGI, Fury Road is also a miracle to even exist. But George Miller's proper use of CGI and practicality put other films to shame. This goes for both the stunning scenes of vehicular carnage, as well as the costume designs, including Immortan Joe's mask. This film's cinematography is Oscar-worthy.

Charlize Theron gives an iconic performance as Imperator Furiosa. Nicolas Hoult, as Nux, delivers the best character arc of the film. And Tom Hardy - who proved with Locke that he doesn't need to move much to command a fascinating performance - proves that he doesn't need to speak much either to be a captivating. The backstories are implied enough that they don't need to be delved into and fleshed out. What's on the surface is gritty and excellent enough. And the bizarre scenes - including a guitar-wielding flamethrower called the Doof Warrior - add to the film's intensity and post-apocalyptic world-building. Needless to say, Mad Max: Fury Road may be one of the best action thrillers in a long time. It's certainly one of the best films of 2015, by far.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 24, 2015","The effects and setting of the film are pretty cool. I didn't like a lot of the way it was filmed, it was discontinuous, almost like they filmed it slow and used fast motion to make it look more normal. Not much of a plot.

"Nov 24, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is a continuation of the previous Mad Maxes and I thought this was pretty darn good. Watching this Mad Max you're sitting there going like, what am I witnessing?  If you have never seen a Mad Max before that will be your reaction. Everything about the Mad Max universe is so different and special Bringing back Miller was the by far the best decision.Without him this movie would not have been anything close to what is was. Miller makes the movie feel like an original Mad Max film. From the weird skull guys, bad ass cars, and post apocalyptic wasteland, A great thing about Mad Max are the characters. Charlize Theron plays Furiosa, a girl who has stolen precious cargo from main villain, Immortan Joe, that all of his followers are after. Charlize Theron as Furiosa was the highlight of the movie. She is the most interesting and most impactful than any other character on screen. Fury Road is the ultimate thrill ride and definition of a good action movie. The action sequences and visual effects are so beautiful and amazing. Every shot is as real as it gets and looks spectacular. Definitely one of the best looking films of the year. The movie is so alive and bright that it makes it hard to keep your eyes off the screen because you don't want to miss anything. My biggest flaw in Mad Max is sadly Tom Hardy's portrayal of Max. I didn't feel his performance was strong enough or energetic like the character should be. But I overall I loved Fury Road.

"Nov 22, 2015","Though the action was relentless throughout, the first hour was a little difficult to follow as the dialogue is kept very much to a minimum.

Its pace is relentless, its storytelling strong, its action impressive. It's morals commendable and surprising - it has feminism rather than machismo at its heart. And its bonkers.

George Miller does a flawless job of creating and executing this set pieces as well as creating a unique and intriguing post apocalyptic world.

"Oct 25, 2015","This movie is way better than I thought it would be. It's mindless action fun, of course, but it's an incredible ride, an adrenaline rush from start to finish.  I honestly cannot believe that this is the same director that did the first Mad Max films more than 30 years ago.  The direction is so fresh and energetic, it seems like someone MUCH younger with a fresh perspective on action films would be responsible for such a film.  I'll admit that I was never a fan of the first films (never even saw the third) and found them exceptionally boring.  This film is a complete 180 of the originals, it's jam-packed with action, action and more action.  And it's all awesome.  The whole film is a series of car-chase/fight scenes (Car chases!  Fights!  Fights on top of cars!), yet it never gets boring.  It's visually eye-popping, everything is well-choreographed and composed, and the stunt-work is freakin' incredible.  Luckily, there are some moments of down time where we do get to learn a bit about the  characters. It's just enough to let the audience catch its breath, then off it goes again.  The film doesn't bother explaining the hows and whys of this dystopian future, but shows you the world and society as it is now, complete with a culture that is surprisingly well-developed.  The story isn't that deep or compelling, but it's got more substance than I expected it to.  The acting is solid too, especially by Charlize Theron, who is completely believable as a badass (don't let the title fool you, this movie is Theron's show).   I do wish there had been a little more explanation of the backstory, sometimes the story and characters' motivations get a bit murky... but there is simply not enough room for that in the movie like this, it would have disrupted the flow.  This movie is pure action spectacle and raw entertainment.  It's a Wham Bam Thank you Ma'am, and everything a summer action flick should be.",NEUTRAL

Overall, this was very entertaining and I look forward to future installments. The negatives were that Charlize Theron has way too large of a role. Even in the trailer and promotional posters, she's clearly the star. Does this hurt the film? Not necessarily but it feels unnecessary. The story should've focused more on Max. We got almost no backstory for his character whatsoever and he maybe speaks a dozen lines. The other element that was a weak point was that some of the scenes were a bit too ridiculous.

"Oct 24, 2015","While Fury Road is superior to it's predecessors and profits from interesting characters, clever dialog, some great make-up and costume design and fantastic use of practical effects rarely seen nowadays, it also suffers from a lack of a compelling story and fails to take advantage of Tom Hardy's suitable portrayal of Max Rockatansky.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 20, 2015","""Visceral"" is the word most often associated with Fury Road, and it's the right word to describe this film.  Everything is satisfyingly crunchy, from the roar of deranged V8 rat rods and muscle cars, to the spectacular action sequences, to the colour-saturated landscape, to the pounding soundtrack, capped off by the unforgettable flame-throwing, guitar-wielding, red-onesie-clad Doof Warrior.

From the moment it starts, you'll be dragged along for a pulse pounding chase across the desert.  It's a simple enough story, but it's obvious from the start that plenty of thought has been put into constructing this dystopian reality.  Small touches will jump out at you, like the intricately designed roof of the War Rig or the ritual scarification of the war boys, that will complete your sense of immersion in this world.

The only reason it doesn't get the full five stars is because of the lack of Australian humour, although even that appears in places, and for a touch of sentimentality that jars somewhat with the nihilistic survival themes that characterise the Mad Max films.

Other than that, so close to perfect that it doesn't matter!  Greatest film of 2015, hands down!",NEUTRAL
"Oct 20, 2015",Truly the best film of 2015,NEUTRAL
"Oct 20, 2015","While moderately overhyped. Mad Max: Fury Road is still a really good movie. In fact I will go to as far and say that its pretty great. And for someone who is not too familiar with the other mad max movies I can safely say that anyone who hasn't seen them will find a lot to enjoy and it may introduce new fans of The series.
 While Tom Hardy may not share much resemblance to Mel Gibson He does a good job at making the role his own as well as preforming some great stunt work which is what I want to see from this guy. But by far the best Character/performance in the Whole movie is Charlize Theron as Furiosa who steels the entire show and makes it her movie. In fact she is more of a hero than max is in this movie. Visually this movie is absolutely fantastic. This movie is gorgeous to look at if this film wins the Oscar for best Cinematography I will not be disappointed.
 The number 1 thing fans go for in this kind of film is the action and boy do we get a lot of it. The action scenes pretty much take up take up almost the entire movie and to say that it keeps you on the edge of your seat would be an understatement. But once in a while the film slows down so that we can learn more about the characters especially Furiosa now granted it is very short lived just so that we can get back to the action but I at least give the filmmakers for at least trying for trying to help us latch on to the main character and making us feel for them during the action scenes. Also did why is no one talking about Nicolas Hoult in the movie. He did a great job and I really felt sorry for his character.
 My only problems with the film would be that the flash backs that max kept having did get a little overused. Yes we get it movie he has a dark past you had 3 Movies to establish this. Also the Villain was really underdeveloped but with a good look and a bad ass voice that does not matter.

"Oct 12, 2015","Review:
What an epic ride! I'm not one for remakes but this was a great movie. It's full of action, right from the beginning to the end and the stunts were amazing. Personally, I think the movie should have been called Mad Furiosa because Max hardly said a word through the whole film. Anyway, in this movie you see Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) being captured by a group of rebels who keep him in a dungeon as there prisoner. When Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is told to pick up some gasoline for the rebels, she takes his five pregnant wives with her because they want to escape from the ruthless warlord, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Whilst travelling across the dangerous wasteland, Joe soon realises that his wives have escaped, so he gathers his various gang's together, so he can get them back. Max also travels with the rebels and he manages to escape from them and ends up helping Furiosa on her impossible mission. The storyline was great and the intensity throughout the movie, kept me on the edge of my seat. Charlize Theron's performance was outstanding and the whole look of the movie was brilliant. It does end quite abruptly so I hope they come out with a sequel soon. I'm waiting to see Mad Max kick butt because there wasn't that much depth to his character. That's not to say that Tom Hardy didn't play his part well but there was just way to much going on for the director to go into his story. Hopefully he will do in the sequel! Anyway, it's definitely one of the best films that I have watched this year and for a remake, it makes the original look mediocre. Brilliant!

Round-Up:
Charlize Theron, 40, first came on the scene in the Children of the Corn III, if anyone actually saw it but most people remember her in Two Days in the Valley in 1996. After starring alongside Tom Hanks in That Thing You Do, she played a major role as Keanu Reeves wife in the Devil's Advocate in 1997 which pushed her to the big league. Her next major role was alongside Johnny Depp in the Astronaut's Wife in 1999 and after the successful Legend of Bagger Vance, she starred with Keanu Reeves again in Sweet November. After that she had a string of average movies like 15 minutes, Trapped and Waking Up In Reno and then she starred in a leading role in the Italian Job remake. In 2004 she won an Oscar & Golden Globe award for the best leading role in Monster and she was nominated for the same award for North Country in 2005. After the disappointing Aeon Flux movie in 2005, she didn't really come back into the limelight until she starred alongside Will Smith in Hancock, which I quite enjoyed. She then got high praise for her role in Young Adult in 2011 and she also starred in the long awaited Prometheus. After that she proved that she can tackle most genres by starring in Snow White and the Huntsman and a Million Ways to Die in the West and then she comes out with this movie were she put in a terrific performance. I just hope she returns for the sequel! This movie was directed my George Miller who also made the original Mad Max movies. He also directed the Twilight movie, the Witches of Eastwick, Lorenzo's Oil, Babe and Happy Feet 1 & 2 so he definitely has experience in different genres. Its planned that he will be directing the sequel Mad Max: Wasteland so I hope that he doesn't spoil the franchise, now that this movie made such a healthy profit. Anyway, the cast was perfect and the concept was fresh and definitely worth a watch.

Budget: $150million
Worldwide Gross: $375million

"Oct 5, 2015","No character development.  Whatever little immersion there is, is stripped away whenever Harding speaks.  The sped up action sequences keep immersion at bay.   The introduction doesn't leave you very impressed with Harding's character, so when we meet Theron's, she isn't built up as a bad ass very well - as its rooted in her hand-to-hand combat with Max.
As for world building: spilling water? Are we to believe that anyone survives on such a brief outpour with so much lost to the ground?  And what gasoline shortage - everyone and their grandmother, seemingly literally, has an engine in good working order and plenty of juice. 
Wouldn't have cared less if Max bought it, didn't care when his car bought it.  The actors just don't pull any of their scenes off.   When the villain fixes to hate the heroes (death of pre-mature son) it looks like he may of just called it a day (silly mask didn't help the actor).  When the young hottie takes to meaning business with watching the back or using a gun, it doesn't even live up to the cliché.  
Zero sexual tension through-out.  The Nux and redhead relation wasn't even sweet - again the scenes were weaker than the cliché.   I don't even know any names besides Nux and Max.
I did like the cinematography of the cool desert night.  However, this is where they hatched the idea of travelling 160 days on bikes.  Well, maybe if they travelled a mile a day.  And of course  in a post-apocalyptic world that was short on gas beforehand, there are plentiful bikes -  in good working order - enough that the stranger guy gets  one laden with supplies and brimming with fuel.
Harding is either a bad actor or wrongly cast.  Mel Gibson, or any number of others, would have shown guile when turning them all back towards the citadel, a bit of sexual tension when the blonde was in tight beside him in the hatch, and so on.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 5, 2015","Mind numbing repetition.  I don't understand how this film gets good reviews.  The story is thin, characters are thinner, mostly this is two hours of car chases and crashes in the desert.  It assumes too much.  Mad Max was a character driven film where we see Max go from a family man that wants to live in peace, to his trial by fire towards the Road Warrior.  By Thunderdome we knew Max, so so it was the development of others against Max's foil that made the story.  In this weak tale a Warlord named Joe keeps many wives and has many more sons.  Imperator Furiosa helps several of Joe's wives escape while on a ""gas run"".  When Furiosa takes a detour Joe finds out immediately and engages in pursuit, catching up quickly, thus begins the bulk of the film, an endless chase scene across the desert.  You'll notice I've said nothing of Max as Max appearance in this film is merely gratuitous.  He really isn't needed except to convince Furiosa to turn back to the Citadel and that could have been done by any of the characters.  This was not a worthy addition to the Mad Max universe.  Perhaps it's time for the franchise to die.  I'm glad I only paid $1 to see this.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 4, 2015","There's a lot of good about this movie - It's a great looker, with a great aesthetic and feel.  There's action, guns, drugged up skinheads who want to rush to ""valhalla"" (Or in otherwords, death.), Post apocalyptic setting.. It has a ton of things going for it, but the issue is.. There's no story OR characters.
The story is just a simple chase-movie. Main character get caught after which he escapes from being a blood-bag (Skinheaded druggies need his blood to continue functioning.) while accidentally meeting up with a truck full of women who are escaping from the Cult leader of the skinheaded druggies. They're trying to escape to ""eden"" which by the words of Furiosa (The manly woman who kicks ass) is a green land from which she was stolen from.
That's it for the story. 80% of the movie is about getting to that place while fighting lots of skinheads in crazy spiky cars.
Characters also aren't built up. Max is the blandest of characters. His character is literally just looking at things angrily and shooting at them. Occasionally sees phantoms of his daughter show up (Which isn't explained at all in the movie.) and shoots more people.
Furiosa's reasons for escaping are explained and that's also literally to ""save other girls"" not really a character trait that has much to it. And otherwise she's also similar to the main character, a hard-ass who gets shit done.

And there comes the issue. You will feel interested in side-characters that come from the enemy side because there's simply no reason to LIKE the main characters. Until the end I was actually cheering for the enemies because hey, they were interesting. There was literally a guitar guy who sat on a huge truck which had HUUUGE speakers and was shooting out fire from his guitar!! That's BADASS! Immortan Joe also looks like a barely alive bulgy old man who's like ""GO TO VALHALLA NOW"".. Which is again.. Pretty neat.

But this movie, although it isn't horrible.. There's nothing ""GREAT"" about it.. It's a solid 60% imho. It's being kept up by its licence and style, but half of the movie is simply less than mediocre.",NEUTRAL

It's not for some of the reasons I've seen floating around - it's a Mad Max movie in name only, since Furiosa is the real star, the iconic car is barely in it then destroyed, there's no Mel Gibson, and whatever else.  I remember liking Beyond the Thunderdome when I saw it, but I wouldn't call myself a Max aficionado for these details to really matter.

I just didn't like it because I was bored.  2 hour movie, and all but 30 minutes of it is car chases.

The post-Apocalypse has never looked so good.  This film is simply gorgeous to look at.  Sure there will be some film snobs tired of the increasingly more common orange/blue palette, but it plays to great effect here.  And it makes the Chrome so shiny!
Miller has created yet another wonderfully bizarre fictive reality, rich with original characters.  If there is to be one criticism of the film it would be that it should drop the Mad Max moniker and simply call itself Fury Road, as Max himself plays much more as a supporting character (indeed he spends much of the film as a hood ornament).  The real lead in this film is Charlize Theron's Furiosa, and Theron infuses her performance with such a cool badassery that she seems to be channeling Ellen Ripley, Sarah Conner, and Beatrix Kiddo all at once.

I don't know actually what to say on the topic, because the world in which the action take place is very accurately built, and also the character has the same great characterization, both the main and the secondary. The rythm never falls, and also in the moments of calm, you feel that something will roar back soon.

"Sep 27, 2015","The original Mad Max film trilogy of the late 1970's to mid 1980's have long endured as classic, dystopian science fiction movies. They made a star of Mel Gibson and gave us the unforgettable image of Tina Turner in a chainmail cocktail frock. I was a little sceptical at yet another reboot of an old movie franchise, there've just been so many disappointing ones churned out over the years. Here however, we have a great movie, that not only honours the originals but could almost fit easily between any of them. In style, it is more like the first Mad Max movie. It is graphically violent and filled with some great car chase and stunt sequences. The character of Max (now played by Tom Hardy) is almost an anti-hero and says very little. Indeed much of the action and plot centres on Charlize Theron's character, Imperator Furiosa, a one-armed, oil tanker-driving rebel who is trying to rescue a group of concubines from the evil clutches of a local warlord. There's a definite feminist undercurrent to this movie and the female characters are refreshingly strong for a movie of this genre. It is telling that George miller, the original director of the series has returned to his baby and taken it forward. He has managed to recreate the visual feel as well as the spirit of his ground-breaking stories and clearly has a tight control over his vision. This is a real edge of your seat movie. Gripping, good fun and I really would like to see where the ""Road Warrior"" ends up next. Hopefully, the rumours of more adventures to come are actually true.",NEUTRAL

Nothing stands up to scrutiny, no character holds up to any real logic, and of course it has nothing to do with the first movies of the same franchise.

Would have preferred to have Charlize Theron's character be Max instead;  maybe changer her name to Maxine.  Then towards the end, when he thinks Theron's character might not make it, Hardy finally says, ""Max, my name is Max.""  Who cares at that point??  Wow, I still can't believe how bad this movie was and how it's getting such positive reviews.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 8, 2015","George Miller regresa a sus orígenes, aquellos que lo hicieron famoso al principio de los años 80... ¡Y Dios, cómo regresa! Con la que es simplemente la mejor película de acción de los últimos años.

La película nos devuelve al mundo post-apocalíptico que conocimos en la trilogía original de Mad Max. Seguimos a Max Rockatansky (Hardy), quien cae prisionero de Immortan Joe, el tiránico Lord de la Guerra (Keays-Byrne). Al verse involucrado en una persecución provocada por Imperator Furiosa (Theron), Max une fuerzas con ella para llevar a las esposas de Immortan lejos de él, a salvo en un lugar llamado ""Lugar Verde"".

Esta película es un evento. Es una obra maestra. Es brillante. ¡Es perfecta! Ésa es la definición adecuada. Perfecta. George Miller ha dirigido una perfecta obra maestra del cine de acción. No exagero ni miento cuando lo digo.

Primero lo primero. No es una película hecha enteramente con efectos prácticos. Los que creen eso son idiotas. ¿Fue filmada en el desierto? Sí. ¿Son los vehículos de verdad? Sí. ¿Son las explosiones y las acrobacias genuinas? Sí. Pero créanme cuando digo que gran parte de todas esas secuencias de acción tienen CGI agregado. Y eso es lo bello del cine moderno y la tecnología. Encontrar el punto medio, encontrar la perfecta mezcla entre efectos prácticos y digitales. Sin embargo, dije que no fue hecha enteramente con efectos prácticos. Pero los efectos prácticos que tiene... ¡Son espectaculares! Asombrosas persecuciones en el desierto, explosivas, adrenalínicas, rápidas, y por supuesto ambientadas con la música personal de Immortan Joe.

Hay que reconocer que la verdadera protagonista de la historia es Imperator Furiosa, interpretada de manera poderosa por Charlize Theron. La actriz demuestra su inigualable talento dándole una fuerza y un carácter a su personaje que permiten que sea capaz de llevar una película en sus hombros. Furiosa es quien define los tres actos del film. Nos presenta la trama, avanza por la historia con Max como su compañero y nos da la resolución. Tal vez esa pueda ser la única ""falla"" válida que se pueda argumentar contra el largometraje. ¿Por qué el protagonista es Furiosa en una película llamada Mad Max? Muy bien, es justo. Eso no significa que esta no sea una grandiosa película. Y Max se mantiene siendo una fuerza presente durante las dos horas de duración, gracias a la actuación de Tom Hardy. Más que un digno héroe de acción es un digno Rockatansky. Su aura silenciosa y letal nos mantiene dentro del misterio de su vida personal. Lo único que se sabe de él en esta película, aparte de su nombre, es que es un hombre con un pasado traumatizante. Nada más. Y no es necesario. Este es un film situacional en el que seguimos el camino de los personajes con respecto a este arco argumental individual. No necesitamos nada más.

Mientras escapan de Immortan Joe, a Max, Furiosa y las esposas de Joe se les une Nux, interpretado por un irreconocible Nicholas Hoult, quien es un ahora renegado de la legión de los War Boys luego de un fracaso al intentar recuperar a sus mujeres. El grupo cruza día y noche el desierto en busca del Lugar Verde. En este punto es importante mencionar la fotografía de este film porque es maravillosa. Las tomas amplias del paisaje son impresionantes. La paleta de colores utilizada captura la vista en una forma que hace que las escenas se vean beneficiadas de su tonalidad y contraste. Incluso si no te gusta el género de acción, esta película es hermosa para simplemente admirar visualmente.
Al llegar a lo que ellos pensaban que era el Lugar Verde, se encuentran con las Vuvalini, comunidad de mujeres en la que nació Furiosa antes de que fuera raptada junto a su madre por el Lord de la Guerra. Las Vuvalini, si embargo, ahora no son más de diez ancianas, buscando lugares para sembrar semillas. Cuanto todos deciden volver al lugar de donde escaparon Furiosa y las esposas, pues ya no está custodiado por el ejército de War Boys, es el momento en que Miller saca su carta bajo la manga y le da al poder femenino su fama definitiva en el film. Un batallón formado por Max, Furiosa, Nux, las esposas de Joe y las Vuvalini es lo que lucha contra el ejército de Immortan en una persecución que excede cualquier expectativa. ¿Ancianas montadas en motocicletas, disparando con ametralladoras y luchando cuerpo a cuerpo contra sus enemigos? ¡Esto es lo que una película de Las Indestructibles debería ser!
Vale mencionar también la banda sonora por Tom Holkenborg (Junkie XL) que incorpora elementos rápidos y frenéticos a la ya acelerada película de manera increíble. Y por supuesto, si hablamos de la música, hay que hablar del hombre con la guitarra lanzallamas. ¡Brillante! Se roba cada escena en la que está, tal vez la misma película. Interpretado por Sean Hape (también conocido como iOTA), es sin duda el personaje secundario más memorable de la película.

En resumidas cuentas, este film es el espectáculo de George Miller. Su genio y talento inundan este largometraje hasta el borde. Cada escena está filmada con un cuidado y majestuosidad que varios directores contemporáneos deben tener presente al admirar a este hombre de 70 años que salió del retiro para realizar este film.

The visual effects were amazing. the performances were really outstanding. It had the right blend of practical effects and CGI and most of all, it made me love a movie about one big left turn.

The story was as straightforward as that of Gravity, but it's the storytelling and the performances that took it a step further for me. The first 20 minutes set the tone perfectly, allowing people to realize that there are creepy people involved in this bizarre ecosystem and they seem to be running the show.

Charlize Theron is brilliant as Furiosa and, despite having Matt Hardy's character's name in the title, owns the movie. Matt Hardy performed like a true filmmaker's actor and, thankfully, didn't become overzealous to make this movie just about himself. He barely has any lines and relies on his superb, and sometimes subtle, acting chops. I keep on forgetting that these are A-list actors and not these characters everytime I watch this movie. They are that good in it.

"Sep 3, 2015","Why I didn't care for the Fury Road

I'm sure most of us have seen Mad Max Fury Road. The movie critics gave it great reviews, rotten tomatoes, and IMDB all show it having approximately a 98% approval rating and now the international film festivals all giving it awards and high accolades.
These are all opinions and everyone is entitled to their opinions. There was just something missing when I watched this reintroduction of one of my childhood heroes. That despondent loner who was first on the search for vengeance for his life that was torn apart and then as a he wanders the dessert in a post apocalyptic Australia he finds himself an unlikely hero to people more desperate than himself. He always manages to win the fight against overwhelming odds.
When watching the former Mad Max Trilogy I always felt a sense of isolation, and desperation. I felt I emotionally connected and could empathize with how lonely his world could be; His family and friends gone, food, gasoline, and water are so scarce they are priceless and coveted by all.
Much of what had built that emotional connection for me in those movies were the cinematography, the sound track/audio work, and the pacing. It wasn't a rip roaring adventure chase scene throughout, it slowed at times and built a sense of suspense and offered time to know and understand key characters.

In my opinion I felt at the opening of Fury Road we should have received a more thorough reintroduction to Max. Those of us who know him already, have not seen him in 30 years (certainly some have re-watched the films), others may have no clue who he is, also he has lived for a period of time wandering the post apocalyptic wasteland on his own since the last film. Show me how this has affected him. In the opening of Fury Road we get a brief voice over monologue as introduction and we see Max forced to eat a lizard as a means of sustenance. Then he is almost immediately captured by bandits from the Citadel.
Even a brief montage of Max searching for something, fuel, food, civilization, show him on the outskirts of the Citadel contemplating if it is a safe place or hostile, give me a camera shot of a small section of road sand blowing over it as a hint of the world that use to be but is now forever lost, Max shaking an empty canteen thirsting for water, shaking empty gas cans. These small things could easily build an emotional connection to Max and make me feel a need to root for him as I then have a better sense of what it would be like in this desperate situation. 
Then we find ourselves at the Citadel... Lots of dirty skinny people here, it must be a crappy place to live but better than wandering the dessert alone. I really don't know how bad these people's lives may be but they get really excited when that rare and coveted resource called water is released...
Wait is water not such a rare resource or are these people just idiots, because when the water is released they catch about 1 cups worth in their random pots and pans then splash around in what is left on the ground. Is this a utopia of plenty filled with a population of morons?
Then their leader Imperator Joe the one who controls the water tells them to not become addicted to the water. Everyone needs water, it's not an addiction it's a necessity Joe. Just bad dialogue...
Joe is a God like figure to this community we later find out because he controls the water and it is pumped up from the ground and only he can command it to be released. So obviously this clan is beholden to him. Also there is plenty of water he is just holding back to maintain his hold on the community
He does have a very ominous mask and costume so I honestly like him as a bad guy figure regardless of some of the less than stirring dialogue he is given.
Then we meet Furious. She gets to drive the truck. Why? I don't know. Apparently she has proved herself in this male dominated militaristic society. I appreciate woman in a strong leadership roles but this society clearly doesn't seem to be heavily dominated by women. I would have appreciated Furiosa's character had I some idea of how she managed to become so entrusted that she gets to drive the truck that hauls their most precious resources fuel, water, and breast milk. That's right the Citadel is a lady milk dairy farm. It doesn't specifically say that but it is conveyed through brief shots of women in a milking room. Just a brief glimpse into her past, flashbacks something throughout the movie to show me what she overcame could really help elevate her character and make you cheer for her. Again it's all about creating an emotional empathy for a character for me.
So Away she goes with her small contingent of security vehicles on her way to the Bullet Farm and Gas Town, I guess to trade milk for supplies... ROAD TRIP!!
We are driving, we are driving, whoa wait what? she went the wrong way...WHY!?! Don't know. Joe's crew is watching, Uh oh she's gone rogue. Why? Uh oh Joe is mad apparently Furiosa stole his lady friends or prized breeders as Joe calls them. You know pet names and all. So cute.
Joe sends out the call to chase down Furiosa and get his ladies back. Rally the WAR BOYS!!
Now we meet NUX, who I really didn't like in the beginning but now I will say he is the only character in the movie that was dynamic enough to make me care about him. NUX as a war boy has one purpose in life and that is to do as Joe commands and if he does an honorable job and pleases Joe he will enter the gates of Valhalla; which I can only assume is some form of heaven. As the movie progresses NUX goes from only wanting to please Joe to realizing he can do good for others and in doing so he would be more significant in this life than he ever was when he was just a war boy out to please Joe.
Additional characters that I believe could have used better development are the Breeders and the Mothers or old ladies, I'm not sure what they were real called because by the time we meet them I was just wishing the movie would end.
The breeders are taken to safety by Furiosa, or they were kidnapped by her because she thought they were abused and didn't want to be with Joe. I'm not sure if the Breeders wanted to leave or Furiosa convinced them they should leave because once they are being pursued by Joe they seem to want to return to him. A simple scene showing how these women suffered under Joe's captivity would have made me care much more about these women. Not that I want to see abuse or cruelty to women but an indication that they had suffered would build an emotional connection that you then want to help save them as well.
The Breeders are the central component of the movie; we should be made to care if they escape.
The old women seriously they just loosely tied a few things together like hey there is no green place turn around and go home. Honestly they could have driven there met no one and formulated a plan to go back.
Now the guitar guy...
I enjoyed the concept of the guitar guy jamming out as the war party moved along but I wanted him to actually play the music that you hear. Instead he plays a bar and then there is a score that takes over and includes none of his guitar work. I wanted him to be James Hatfield from Metallica melting my face with Fuel for fire...makes sense they need fuel, guitar guy is shooting fire. Also guitar guy is shooting fire but not using it to fight anyone, super wasteful!
Here in a post apocalyptic world where fuel is scares and this idiot is just burning it up!!
I don't feel a sense of scarce resource or desperation. The Breeders are wasting water when they get one of their miraculous escapes from a horde of fast moving vehicles. All the vehicles are supercharged gas guzzlers, NUX empties about 10 gallons of gas into his car in an attempt to kill himself and blow up the war wagon. Really if I was in charge and someone wasted that much gas there would be no Valhalla for them.
I just didn't get the same desperate, these are hard times sense from this movie. I wanted to feel suspense, the whole time you just knew these guys were going to make it and Furiosa and Max would live but you knew NUX was going to be dead before the movie was over. Of course they had their close calls but never did you think ""oh man this is the end for them"".
It was a great bit of Cirque Du Sole style chase scenes pieced together again and again but I really could have done with 45 min less chase scene and 45 min more character development.
On top of all of this I'm a car guy and there were a number of ridiculous vehicle related items that were wrong or nearly impossible.
Climbing around touching hot exhaust pipes, an 18 wheeler can escape motorcycles and supercharged cars, Nux drives with a flat tire at high speed (Max would have to stay in place for this to be somewhat possible but still incredibly unlikely, spitting a fuel mixture into the supercharger and getting boost, climbing around in an engine compartment fixing the engine while driving down the road and its not just a single engine it's a dual engine setup. This rig would lose so much power after losing 50% of its power it would be crawling along not out running all those other vehicles.

Yes, Yes it's just a movie don't nitpick the silly details but really character development could have tied it all together in a Lovely package for me.

Okay enough of the why I didn't like it. Honestly I just wanted more of an emotional connection to the characters.

"Sep 2, 2015","Simply can't get over how much fun this movie is. Shot and directed to perfection, with breath-taking action and a killer score, Mad Max defies almost all tropes of modern Hollywood blockbusters. The film is incredibly smooth, and provides the rare opportunity to just sink in and forget about everything around you, which seems to be lacking from many other films.

One thing I noticed and really appreciated is how colorful the movie is. Instead of a dark tone, Miller chose to color the movie with nothing but bright and vibrant shades. Even the night-time scenes are a very vibrant blue.

It's quite mind-boggling to think that Miller, a 70-year old man, creating this master-class non-stop action thrill ride. The first twenty minutes are filled with more energy and passion than about any film that's come out this year.

"Aug 30, 2015","Wow!! What a movie Mad Max: Fury Road is the story of Mad Max (Tom Hardy) as he follows Charlize Theron as she and a few fellow women try to outrun patriarchal tyranny in the guise of the white Darth Vader aptly named just,Joe. Although Mad Max is the titular character the main protagonist is Furiosa with a story that is all the same; a feminist movie in the setting of masculine, testosterone driven, balls to the wall beginning to end action frame for frame. George Miller returns to make the fourth entrance in the film series that made him famous over 30 years ago. Its also funny that as a grandpa who has made such family films as Babe and Happy Feet shows modern day action filmmakers how it's done. He uses more practical effects and CGI sparingly to give us a fully realized encompassing story filled with so much action that will leave you in awe. If you're not captivated and don't buy into this movie you either don't like action movies, which is understandable, or you're just numb from overindulgence of action and a good old fashioned action film can't satiate you're lust for all things destructive.

"Aug 29, 2015","Must admit that thanks to the original Mad Max (yes people, this is a remake...a new way to put it on cinema but is the same thing from the 70's); anyway, I admit once more that thanks to this story, classic video games like Twisted Metal & Borderlands came to existence (n other words, got born). Yeah, Borderlands has more story/dialogue if you think of it over Mad Max (Mad is more action than dialogue...something I don't like very much on movies since I love more to think than to sleep). Honestly, this movie works coz it's visually stunning and if you have played those games, you will love it even more OR if you grew up watching the original...nostalgia must be the correct choice. So yes, I recommend this film only for those reasons.

"Aug 25, 2015","After a surprise premier at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Mad Max: Fury Road is poised to melt audience's faces off this weekend.  Supposedly picking up things where the 1985 film Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome left off, George Miller's new installment in the franchise sees the titular character (this time played by Tom Hardy) facing off against more carnage, blood, guns, cars, and chaos. Max has just pissed off a local warlord/cult leader named Immortan Joe, and he is out for revenge. His escape through the Australian outback sees him cross paths with Furiosa, a dangerous and unpredictable rogue leader with her own agenda. The two form a makeshift team of sorts, and the pair must to to rely on each other in order to outwit Immortan Joe's ever growing pursuit.

Essentially, this all boils down to one hell of a chase movie, filled to the brim with hyper-masculinized batshit crazy antics. Miller directs the action sequences flawlessly with a kinetic, constantly-moving energy, which adds a mesmerizing layer of visceral appeal to the whole thing. Fury Road is pure spectacle and looks great - even in 3D, where objects fly in and out of the frame without feeling too gimmicky or distracting. The level and precision of detail that went into this film is almost as crazy as the stunts; various tattoos, weapons, clothing, vehicles, makeup, etc. are all incredibly well-crafted and give the film a unique feel of time and place. Oscar nom for Best Production Design anyone?

Despite the film's desire to be constantly churning on a violent machismo overdrive, Fury Road feels perplexingly feminist at times. Charlize Theron's portrayal of Furiosa easily makes her the coolest character in the film, and her determination to be both wickedly badass but still sensitive when needed overshadows Hardy's quiet and one-dimensional performance as Max. And then there is a scene where an all-women militia take out a human trafficking gang. Girl power for the win.

Fury Road, like many other films of its genre, suffers a bit from lack of characterization, dialogue, and undervalued performances. The most we ever hear from Max is during the opening voice-over, where he sprawls on giving the necessary exposition to explain that this is a post-apocalyptic film where survival is valued and ethics and law are not. I wish we could have seen more of an explanation for his backstory, or more interactions with him and Furiosa - just something more to show that Max is indeed a person and not some lifeless prop.

Despite it's few setbacks, Fury Road keeps the narrative tight and compelling, which compliments the unstoppable fluidity of the action. It's a rich and immersive film, sure to impress those who can stomach it's brutality, and a rare treat to see something so adrenaline-packed without compromising on story.

Leaving me feeling like a child at the amusement park, Fury Road no doubt sets the bar high for what a summer action flick can and should aspire to.",NEUTRAL

Or, perhaps, they are used to amateurish backstory-dialog-dumps that have unfortunately become the norm. Characters only say things to each other that actually make sense, not like in Christopher Nolan movies where they bizarrely tell each other things they already know for the benefit of the viewer which they must know is there because otherwise there is no reason for them to be saying what they are saying. You need to get absorbed in the movie and PAY FUCKING ATTENTION YOU STUPID TWATS! All the plot is there, all the exquisite detail of the world is there, just get absorbed in the movie and look at it from the point of view of a person dropped in the world.

Its there - you just have to dig for it and not expect to get spoon fed. You just want to see cars go boom? That's there too. If you like both of those aspects you will be shiny and chrome all the way to Valhalla. 

Brilliant direction drives the stunning imagery. I can see how it's similar to The Road Warrior, but it feels less so in the end, but comparing to the original is oddly enough an apples-to-oranges comparison. 

Hardy plays it great but Theron steals the show. Strong yet human and real and tougher than you, she delivers through and through.. Her portrait of Furiosa is nothing short of epic and it's her sub-plot that drives most of the movie. Even the redemption of the warboy outshines Max. Using Max as the pallet to mix the other stories is a brilliant bit of film making. 

There was no need to make this a Mad Max movie and I suspect it was a device Miller needed to get the studios on board. They just could have made a new movie titled after the main character, which isn't Max.

"Aug 22, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is quite impressive; I would go so far as to call it close to a miracle. 

I almost never see, rather than review, movies in this genre, as its not my thing. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Mad Max was pretty good, and it paid homage to its Gibson-esque prequels. The film works on almost every level: as a comic book movie, as an action flick, as a character study, and much more. Also, it has beautiful cinematography and performances to burn; some of the CGI was almost as good as in the 2009 movie ""Avatar"", I dare to say. It was a really well done movie overall, that will satisfy almost any viewer, and I highly recommend the experience.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 22, 2015","extremely disappointing installment. Non of the actors made me believe in them. I saw them make the journey and I was viewing from a far. If I want to connect to Max's story I am better of dusting off the first three. It is, however, visual entertainment and for that it is great fun for a movie night, but not a worthy successor. I do not understand that the titular character is playing second fiddle to Ms. Theron's character. I almost feels that Mad Max was added to justify the Mad Max elements (post apocalyptic landscape, tribal societies and outrageous vehicle) and to boost box office sales. The script seems to be written not to tell Max's story, he's just along for the ride. The one moment MAx had an opportunity to take central stage and which might have made it a Mad Max film, was cut on the editing floor I assume. It was the nightly action, where Max returns with blood on his face and the viewer does not even get a glimpse of what our boy did. Just Charlize's words ""it is not his blood"".",NEUTRAL

Director George Miller has reinvigorated the Mad Max mythos with an unexpected surge of gorgeously photographed action set pieces that put every other big budget superhero/action film this summer to shame. Even more surprising than watching a 70 year old George Miller hand Hollywood's action filmmaking elite their own asses, is that Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa is the star of the film. Theron has created a badass for the ages and the decision to have her character drive the narrative is brilliant.

Mad Max Fury Road is for sure a must watch if you like action films. This movie has some the best Visuals of the last 5 years. Max Max Fury Road is the best in the franchise. What a lovely day to rewatch Fury Road,NEUTRAL
"Aug 18, 2015","30 years after the release of 'Thunderdome' Mad Max is finally back. The lone wolf, the single warrior, the loner, the lone soldier, the outcast, the outsider, the man with no name...errr...named Max. The hype has been stratospheric for this one, I have gone into this expecting truly mind blowing things, the greatest action movie ever made? lets see, I will be brutally honest in every aspect.

So the bottom line, this is virtually based around one sequence from 'Mad Max 2' and made into an entire movie. We all know which sequence, the one with that bloody great gas tanker covered in gun turrets and spikes. That sequence was epic on so many levels, a truly award winning vision of distopian  science fiction...where all the goodies get killed, awesome. Now, in this tale Max has been captured by the War boys who are all led by Immortan Joe. Your standard gang of barbaric lunatics, only this time not kitted out in S&M gear, no this time they are all painted up in a tribal sort of way. Long story short, Max has gotta reluctantly help out Charlize Theron's character of Furiosa (with the help of Nicholas Hoult's ill War Boy character, Nux) in saving some damsels in distress from Joe whilst trying to reach some fabled lush green lands. This of course equals a whole load of vehicle chases across the outback which basically never stop.

The first sequence we see is Max's classic and gorgeous black pursuit special (the now famous 1973 Ford XB Falcon GT) getting trashed, wait what??!! I heard about this before hand and I have to say I don't like it one bit, I wanted to see that fucking car in action once again, damn it Miller! Not quite sure how Max's super fast special manages to get wiped out by the collection of clown cars chasing him but never mind, it bloody happened didn't it, ugh!

So one of the first things we see as the real story kicks in is Immortan Joe's citadel which appears to built into a fecking massive cliff. How the hell did they manage to do that? there's like some sprawling catacombs in this rock by the looks of it, I wouldn't of thought anyone had any time in between killing each other and building ridiculous killer automobiles. This is actually one aspect that didn't sit well with me, this whole idea felt way too grand and over the top for a Mad Max movie, it looked like something from the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy...only with cars instead of orcs. Then if I really wanted to be picky I would ask how everyone is so muscular in this dead post-apocalyptic world, meh don't question it. Its here we start to see the strange freakish array of characters that inhabit this new Earth, gotta say I loved what I saw here for the most part. Miller has always been good at creating these bizarre characters for this franchise and he nails it again here.

Most of the bad guys are just big rippling baldies covered in white paint for some reason (the War Boys), not much background given but they look intimidating for sure. Other citadel dwellers and bad guys come in various shapes and sizes such as the creepy looking Corpus Colossus, a physically disabled child of Joe with exceptional intelligence (a real person with a real disability). Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones), a huge muscular mammoth of a man, dim-witted and another son of Joe. The Bullet Farmer who is some ugly aging bloke in a suit of bullets and...is a farmer?, hence is name. The People Eater is a big fat bald guy (everyone is bald in the distopian future) who I guess eats people? Again hence is name and the reason he's so fat, he also looks to have lost his nose because he wears some kind of metal plate there. The Doof Warrior who is some crazy blind bloke that rides a war rig (the Doof Wagon) into battle strapped to some huge speakers and playing a fire spouting guitar. This guy seems to have become the new Boba Fett of the movie world but he doesn't actually do anything, in fact I fail to see the point of him or the drummers other than simply to look cool. Admittedly he does look cool, certainly unique with his mothers face for a mask (oh yes), but basically pointless.

Lastly we have Immortan Joe who is easily the most effective looking character I've seen in years. His mask appears to be some kind of breathing apparatus that is attached to some kind of bellows around his neck. The mask is slightly reminiscent of an old WWII pilots oxygen mask but with a terrifying line of big teeth like a skeleton. Not too sure about his ending though, was his mask like...attached to has face and skull? He also seems to wear some kind of transparent body armour with medals and whatnot attached, obviously he suffers from some kind of affliction or disease. Visually this guy looks fucking amazing, the makeup really tops it off with his pale ghostly complexion and silver balding, widows peak hair line. All in all the selection of characters gave off a very 'Dune-esque' (1984) vibe in my opinion.

The action is virtually constant here, its the trademark of the movie (and franchise), non-stop. The main bulk of the action centres around Max and co trying to escape on the tanker under a barrage of gunfire and explosions. Now yeah, we've seen this before in 'Mad Max 2' but this has been ramped up to maximum overdrive, its insane! There are vehicles being torn up and flipped all over, metal mechanical shrapnel shattering all over the desert, bodies are flying everywhere, War Boys are leaping around on pole vault type things hurling explosives, gunfire, stabbings, fisticuffs...all happening on and off various extreme vehicle creations. It all looks completely real (because all the stunts were real), its highly impressive and shows great achievement in both eruptive action and practical effects. On top of that the location work, scenery shots, panoramas and the crisp, bold colour palette really look nothing short of gorgeous, it almost looks too good for this type of movie. Gives you faith in movies again it really does.

That's not to say the action saves it completely, in my view. Amongst all this grade A action you do have to wonder how Max, Joe and others manage to survive some of the horrific fender benders they get into. The good guys battle their way away from the citadel, all that way, only to come back again and do it all again? wut?! The canyon sequence stuck out as a very daft cheesy notion. This biker gang that hides out there, living in and around the canyon walls, which they ride about on...with motorbikes? bit risky isn't it. Also, where did they all get their matching costumes? When the good guys come back through the canyon, do they go a different way? didn't it get blocked off. And it does all seem nuts that all this happens purely because Joe wants his girls back. He unleashes his entire armada and risks everything just for some ass? can't you find more girls in your citadel? Oh and in the end the citadel bad guys just let Max and co into their city and take over? huh? he just killed your leader.

The greatest action flick ever? hmmm not too sure about that, its certainly up there but I still find myself preferring the gritty cult classic 'Mad Max 2' with Gibson. I think Hardy does a reasonable job but he is no Mad Max if you ask me. One thing I hated actually was the deliberate lack of dialog from Max, it worked well in the older films (MM2) simply because there was less to explain, 'MM2' was like a bloody 80's videogame it was so straight forward. Here there are things that could use background information plus the amount of times Max gets into a situation (mainly at the start) where I really wanted him to just speak! say something!! Explain your situation to Furiosa then she might not try to kill you...ugh! I found that actually frustrating and it didn't need to be like that.

Still, the fact that the goodies went back on themselves towards the end really made me groan frankly. Its like Miller didn't know how to end it so he just made them go back and run the same gauntlet all over again, easy option for more of the same. I won't lie and say I didn't like it, but I won't lie and say I thought it was a stunning movie, the action is monumental at first but after the initial hardcore, automobile, carnage sequence, things felt a little tamer. The initial visual shock and awe that hit my eyeballs, making them swell, started to ease off. So awe-inspiring visuals all round and some great characters...visually at least. Is this a good flick? yes, yes is it, its a very engaging solid action movie, buts lets not get too carried away. Its really a one trick pony if you're honest about it, big gas tanker with goodies fights off hordes of baddies, rinse, wash and repeat until credits. The only real difference is its Furiosa's story, and to a degree, Nux too, unfortunately Max is just along for the ride in his 30 year old reboot.",NEUTRAL

The first time I saw it, me and my buddy were so mesmerized by the film that we sat through every second of the credits (which are like 15 minutes long) blown away and speechless.. This was the most visceral, immersive movie experience I've ever had. Gravity and Avatar were also visceral and immersive but to even think about putting them in the same boat as Mad Max: Fury road is a joke. Before I ramble on and on, I'll keep it short and simple: Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action movie ever made. I enjoy bringing people who haven't seen it to see it so they too can experience what I think with time will be considered the best action movie ever by not just me, but by the majority of long-time film critics. See it twice, three times, see it ten times (I've heard of someone who has seen it 11 times), just make sure and see it once and get ready for roller-coaster adrenaline soaked 2 hour movie experience like no other.

It was OKAY... Obviously with today's technology and FX, it was eye candy, with Michale Bay type of crashes; camera angles and explosions, however...
The story was seriously lacking however- ALL the focus was on Charlize Theron's character. Max Max's famous Interceptor car, lasted a whole 5 minutes in the movie. While Max himself, spends almost 25 minutes of the movie stuck on the front of a large truck without really being able to talk??
The story was seriously lacking in depth. I watched Mad Max 1 & 2, just before the new one. Something was missing from this new movie.... It lacked feel and body.
Other strange things were added that I was not sure about.... The entire movie basically takes place on the back of one specialized fuel truck, and that is pretty much it!
The casting for Max himself, was not right either... The actor, Tom Hardy, mumbled rather than spoke, making his lines hard to hear. He is NO Mel Gibson.....

"Aug 15, 2015","Physical effects make a triumphant return to the GGI saturated season of summer blockbusters. Max Rockatansky has emerged from the waste land in Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) to show us the light of epic cinema. George Miller gets another bite at the Mad Max apple and produces a Lawrence of Arabia (1962, David Lean, UK) type epic while making a strong feminist statement in a post apocalyptic acid trip fever dream.
                 
        I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the uncanny valley but the epic scope of Lawrence of Arabia (1962, David Lean, UK) versus Revenge of the Sith (2005, George Lucas, USA) is apparent to anyone whose viewed both.  CGI is helpful and can be a great asset to a filmmaker. Fury Road has over 2,000 visual effects shots[i]. That being said it's not how much CGI you use but how you use it. It's the motion in the ocean not the size of the boat. Often Miller's use of CGI is used to color correct shots, add clouds to the clear Namibian sky, and dessert rocks turned a much richer hue.
              
        After screening Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) themes George Miller was hinting at in Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome (George Miller, AUS, 1985) became much clearer.  The Triple Goddess helps redeem Max when he is at his most feral, his humanity holding on by a shred and our titular hero can only manage guttural sounds in lieu of language. Tom Hardy plays the titular character in this latest Mad Max incarnation. Max fights to protect the maiden or in this case maidens. He is aided and rescued by the mother and in this case the mother is the warrior Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron crushes this role), and lastly he is aided by the crone. In Miller's post apocalyptic wasteland the crone is a bunch of motorcycle driving, seed toting, rifle shooting bad ass grandmas.

        At one point Max washes blood off his hands using the contents of a tanker full of mother's milk.The themes in Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) are often not subtle but don't seem heavy handed in a movie that has little to no exposition. In an era when movies find it necessary to have a pseudoscience explanation for our super heroes and science fiction it's refreshing to have a movie not crow bar in needless exposition. Much like Sergio Leone Miller uses action and his actor's body language and facial expressions to convey story instead of relying on dialogue.  In Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) there's no time to waste with monologues as the drums of war beat in the distance and a war party race towards you and among them is flame throwing guitar player strapped to a flat bed full of speakers racing down the dessert with dozens of other maniacs painted white. Oh did I forget to mention the maniacs in white body paint drive hot rods that have gentlemen with explosive spears ridding atop them.
                 
        I've heard the notion bandied around that George Lucas is treated unfairly by adult fans who didn't like the prequels. That the movies were not bad they were just now adults and not the target audience as they were in 1977. Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) takes that thesis and crumples it up and tosses it in the rubbish bin. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (George Miller, AUS, 1981) & the Star Wars trilogy live in the same sweet spot in my pre-adolescent heart. In fact they are probably neighbors and enjoying going over each other's homes for summer BBQs or drinks around the holidays. Coincidently they live down the street from Raiders of Lost Ark (Steven Spielberg, USA, 1981). If my review hasn't been clear up till now stop reading this and go see this movie NOW!

"Aug 14, 2015","Although this movie was probably just an excuse to show off as much extraordinary special effects as they had to offer, (which could've been a soul-crushing CGI void with no story) they somehow managed to pull it off as a surprisingly well-rounded story with a not overly sexualized female lead, something that many movies are sorely lacking in. I will admit when I first saw the trailer I was unsure as to whether this would be any good, but after seeing it in theaters I had absolutely no doubts. It manages to stay surprisingly human while also completely suspending all logic with thrillingly insane action. Many people might say that there is no story, however I would argue that one reason why it's so good is its nuanced yet rich story. For example, the reason that the little girl in Max's mind is so haunting is because she's such an enigma. We never fully see her backstory or get hit over the head with clunky exposition about it, and yet she is an essential part of the story. All-in-all, I would say that out of the many I saw this summer, this is by far the best action movie of 2015. Full stop.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 11, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is the fourth installment in George Miller's series, and I was slightly disappointed. To get this straight, the movie is pretty much a 2 hour car chase. Action packed and violent, Fury Road gives you absolutely no plot whatsoever, and at the end leaves you confused. The movie makes no sense, the only reason this review is getting it's two stars are for the action sequences. But when you leave the theater, your going to ask your self, ""What the heck was going on in that film""? If you like violence, violence, violence, violence, then this is your film. You want a interesting story in this hyped film? Your sadly mistaken.

"Aug 9, 2015","There's no way to sum up the pure insanity of this film with the written word.  If you missed it on the big screen, I truly feel sorry for you.  So many summer blockbusters feel like they've had all their creativity and originality picked away to dumb it down for a mass audience.  Then along comes 75-year-old director George Miller, who was given a big pile of cash and left all alone to continue his Mad Max franchise.  Tom Hardy successfully steps in for Mel Gibson, but otherwise this retains, and actually improves upon all the elements that made The Road Warrior such a classic.  While the performances, production design and cinematography are all impressive, it's the fact this film relies on 100% practical effects and stunt work for its thrills.  Unlike every other mega-budget movie Hollywood barfs out, Mad Max isn't drowning in pointless, over-the-top CGI.  You know everything you're seeing on screen is actually happening and that's what makes it such an insanely enjoyable experience.  If I have one complaint, it's that Max pretty much remains on the sideline for much of the film.  Which is a shame considering what a great actor Hardy is.  Here's hoping he comes out of his shell and is front and centre for the next chapter.  Otherwise this is without a doubt one of 2015's best!",NEUTRAL

Tom Hardy goes above and beyond to demonstrate yet another persona of the acting world of which he can portray to perfection.  The action is riveting.  The narrative is enticing.  You will be sucked into this from the opening scene looking out across the desert.  The use of subtle imagery throughout is like that of little pleasurable gifts to the viewer scattered about (e.g. the lizard behind Hardy in opening scene).  There is no need to be familiar with the backstory for this one, and it is to the viewers advantage that they might go in unknowing of what is about to take place.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 28, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is, without question, the height of action filmmaking greatness. A flat-out, heart-in-your-throat, deranged showstopper that punches brawns, grit and cinematic ferocity back to the Hollywood blockbuster, without ever sacrificing emotional fullness. It also, unexpectedly, lobs a bold equality statement in the form of Charlize Theron, whose Imperator Furiosa joins the group of cinema's great feminist fighters, along with Ellen Ripley in Aliens and Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Mark my words, this film will be touted as one of the ultimate action masterpieces of our time.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2015","Assigned to drive a massive truck to collect gasoline, Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has another plan: once there is a good distance between the vehicle and her starting point, she would veer off-track and return to her homeland-along with five wives of cult leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byryne). A hot pursuit erupts, with ailing Nux (Nicholas Hoult), chained to a prisoner named Max (Tom Hardy), hoping to impress Immortan Joe so he can be welcomed to Valhalla when he dies.

""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" directed by George Miller, is an orgasmic visual exercise of yellow-orange sand, sweltering heat, vehicle acrobatics, dramatic explosions, and deformed, heavy makeup-wearing citizens of a collapsed world bound by no rules. Even without a deep story, it engages thoroughly because the images are so hyperbolic, there is not one film that is remotely like it in the past decade.

The action scenes are inspired and creative. The picture is composed of one long chase sequence but there is variety in the counters between heroes/heroines and villains. With each geographic change, we get an idea about the group of people who live within that area. Particularly memorable is the biker gang waiting atop a narrow canyon. A deal has been made between the gang and Furiosa. Based on how the scene is shot as our protagonists enter the canyon, we know immediately that something is about to go wrong.

Such is the film's strength: it is shot with a sense of urgency. Although the narration in the beginning briefly describes the circumstances that led to humanity's decay, we remain curious about its universe nonetheless because it does not spell out every detail. As the characters trek across dry terrains, we discover the journey with them. For instance, the challenge is not only avoiding or eliminating those who try to kill them. All characters must also be wary of and be prepared for the cruel environment that awaits.

At times the picture attempts to do too much. A romantic connection is introduced eventually which does not work at all. The problem is, we have a basic understanding about only half of the would-be couple. Character depth and development is not one of the film's strengths and so such a desperate attempt to get us emotionally involved, through a romantic scope, comes across as forced and unnecessary. Sometimes less is more.

The two leads, Hardy and Theron, and two supporting actors, Hoult and Keays-Byrne, are a joy to watch because they are unafraid to exaggerate their emotions, to look unattractive physically, to embody their deranged characters completely. Each one commands a high level of creative energy and so he or she is front and center, there is a magnetism and charisma to the performance. We are inspired to learn more about each one of these characters and yet the material has a way of always keeping us at arm's length. Perhaps we are not meant to get to know these people for their world is so different than ours, they might as well have been of a different species.

Written by George Miller, Brendan McCarthy, and Nick Lathouris, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a visual spectacle but there is room for some improvement as mentioned previously. I see potential as a modern franchise-one that is not about superheroes or chosen ones destined to save a dystopian world, but one that is about a decaying world and the degenerates who are struggling to survive in it.

Almost the perfect manifestation of an action film, this recent ""Mad Max"" franchise installment goes to show that (somewhat) steady camera work and a well-built (read: minimal CGI) world full of unique characters can leave an audience in awe of its accomplishment.

It's all super crazy and vibrant on the surface but very, very cold and measured right beneath it.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 24, 2015","After some 30 years writer director George Miller brilliantly brings back to a new generation of moviegoers his iconic character of Mad Max, which was originally played by Mel Gibson in a breakout performance that made him an international superstar. Miller's new visually stunning, supercharged reboot is a punk-influenced dystopian vision with an angry feminist streak, it is also a non-stop relentless orgy of brutal violence, death, blood, automotive mayhem peppered with collisions and explosions, as well as unforgettable, adrenaline-pumping, kinetic action sequences that puts to shame every action blockbuster in recent memory! The plot concerns the revenge seeking desert nomad Max Rockatansky, played impressively by Tom Hardy, who skillfully takes over the role from Gibson and proves to be a worthy successor. Max is roped into helping a one-armed, steely-eyed, badass female protagonist named Furiosa, played magnificently by Charlize Theron in a scene-stealing performance, she has escape with five young women from the clutches of Immortan Joe, a fearsome, psychotic warlord who wears a teeth-bar mask, he is chillingly played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the sadistic villain ""Toecutter"" in the 1979 original Mad Max. Joe with his army of murderous gonzo warriors and tricked-out vehicles race across the desert, he will stop at nothing to recover his female property, and is totally hellbent on stopping them. Masterful direction by George Miller, exceptional supporting performances by Nicholas Hoult, Josh Helman, Nathan Joe, Zoe Kravitz, Rosie hunting-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abby Lee, Courtney Eaton, but it's Charlize Theron's feminist freedom fighter that surprisingly steals this awesome film. Dazzling cinematography by John Seale, with extraordinary razor-sharp editing by Jason Ballantine and Margaret Sixel. The film has breathtaking stunt work. A cinematic work of jaw-dropping imagination and artistic craftsmanship, a total masterpiece. One of the year's best films. Highly Recommended.",NEUTRAL

That's right. The nearly mute heroes, played by Theron and Hardy, lend their hard-won survival skills to the rescue of two bands of women -- the first one serving essentially as brood mares for the evil bad guy of the film, the second an abandoned group of Amazonian warriors. All the actors are excellent, but I especially liked Nicholas Hoult's white-faced, have-nekkid true believer punk motorhead inhabitation. This is an insanely amped-up visual movie, with more sight-gags and visual story elements in a minute than you normally get in a full scene. Indeed, there is nary a minute wasted on exposition. Somehow, through a combination of the visuals, the action, and economical dialog, the audience jumps on for the ride. Everything is clear, and there are high stakes. A perfect summer popcorn movie, a genre which has in recent years become for me more of an epithet than its original meaning: a well-made movie that uses movie conventions as shorthand for telling stories that matter to audiences.",NEUTRAL

As you can see, madness is at an epidemic stage, and if you go into Mad Max: Fury Road expecting anything other than full-on madness, then you sir will tremble at the sight of the desolate orange landscape filled with bald-headed powdered men, normal-looking models and one very lonely, fearsome man with no cause in life but to surviveâ?¦ and yes, he may not be as mad as some of the creatures in this barren backdrop, but he is downright bonkers in his bravery, and his name is Max!
 
30 years ago, the original Mad Max trilogy starring Mel Gibson in the title role ended, so did it the hopes of the Australian New Wave, and the career of its director George Miller who hasnâ??t recaptured his initial personal success. But, in 2015 the Mad Max franchise has been brought back into existence and the only thing connecting both franchises, other than the character Max, is the creator Miller himself. This is the way to do it! No film gets rebooted 30 years later with its creator still at the fore of proceedings. Mad Max as a film manages to keep the heart of the originals, but George Millerâ??s intelligence is that he doesnâ??t allow the film to get stuck in time failing to make use of its new audience, he instead brings it up to date so fans of originals and audienceâ??s of today will all flock to the cinema to see what has become of this breeding ground of insanity. Upon first viewing, I think it is safe to say, especially in this era of ever-growing franchises, that there is a future for Mad Max, or better yet we want this madness to return!
 
Maxâ??s world may be fire, it may be blood, but he has never come across such powdery men in his fourth outing. Set in a future desert wasteland where supplies such as gasoline and water are scarcities, and only the most fierce, deranged people are able to collect the most. The tyrannical cult leader of the Citadel, Immortan Joe, sends Imperator Furiosa and a bunch of his white war boys to collect gasoline on a heavily fortified oil rig, but as Furiosa drives significantly off route, Joe sends his entire army, and himself, in pursuit of her. One of Joeâ??s war boys Nux uses Max as a universal blood donor, and as he attempts to take down Furiosa himself, Max joins forces with her and a lengthy car chase ensues in which blood, fire, mud, and a literal hurricane sandstorm shake proceedings up.
 
Mad Max: Fury Road is one big long, fat, redemptive, helluva cross-country chase that willingly turns into two rounds where the goodies and baddies attempt to cross the barren desert landscape in such a toxically insane fashion. Audienceâ??s will start rejoicing for two reasons: 1) because the Mad Max: Fury Road experience was ballistic and 2) our worldâ??s evil is a miniscule pinch compare to these rabid folks. The road rage puts Fast & Furious 6â??s endless runway chase to shame ten times over!! The action is so original, and so over-the-top that it proves an action film can live off of its stunts. All this madness occurs whilst moving and that is the best part of it; because everything moves, there is such an unexpectedness to the action, and that is saying tonnes coming from action films of today, that sitting back and expecting literally anything is the only way to watch it. Mad Max: Fury Road is a heck of a film that makes action films of yesteryear appear lacklustre, and the action blockbusters of today look like they wet themselves trying to make even a fraction of the action Mad Max throws at us a tiny bit decent. Mad Max: Fury Road has set a benchmark for future action films, and the only reason it has set a benchmark is because it is as if this is the first action film weâ??ve seen!
 
Interwoven within the pandemonium of action is an unrelenting dosage of preposterousness that makes Mad Max as a package: a rip-roaring spectacle of unyielding madness. It is a combination of bizarreness with more bizarreness, which alongside the electric action and thoughtful storyline simply elevates the Mad Max: Fury Road experience to ridiculous levels. From the gory deaths (let me say not as bad as the original trilogy), to the no nonsense cars, a mirage of good-looking women and a nutcase playing electric guitar on top of a car during the road rage emphasises Mad Max as not only original, but simply bonkers entertainment! Thanks to the impatient storyline, the marathon car chase allows for angles cameras never knew existed before, or perhaps felt no need to go there, making Mad Max unique on the eye as well. To sum up the action: Mad Max: Fury Road is a visual explosion of insanity that does what it says on the tin. Of course for some this penetration of madness can be over the top, but you came to watch â??Madâ?? Maxâ?¦ what on Earth did you expect?
 
Imagine a 59-year-old Mel Gibson jumping off of cars during a hurricaneâ?¦ yeah, sorry Mel it was never going to happen, ever! But, Tom Hardy is possibly the best actor out there that fitted the raggedy and fierce Max Rockatansky, and thank God he got the role. His presence never goes unnoticed for his quietly eerie attitude adds a profundity to Max that wasnâ??t there in Gibsonâ??s performance. One thing though, he does on occasion sound like a robot, but that takes nothing away from a great performance. Charlize Theronâ??s portrayal of Imperator Furiosa threatens to steal the limelight away from Hardy. Her shaved head, bionic arm and ruthless fighting skills and attitude just make Furiosa such a badass character, possibly the best supporting character in the Mad Max universe. Nicholas Houltâ??s Nux is a revelation, for his bonkers attitude is one that brings a dimension of fun to the action. Hoult may be the romantic English-boy, but this performance of a crazed war boy, along with the hairy, blue mutant Beast, sees Houltâ??s career in ascension. And Hugh Keays-Byrne returns to Mad Max as Immortan Joe, again as the evil leader, with such ferocity that he creates a worthy foe to Max.
 
Where the success truly lies with this film is the narrative. There is not much talking but the resonance of the taleâ??s importance is truly felt. The long-winded chase allows for character development both from the good and bad side. They may not talk much, but you can feel how they feel because the acting is so raw; after all the action and dirt accumulated in the desert heat, the accomplishment at the end of the film feels so satisfying. The richness of the script, despite it lacking much talking, gives the words that are said extra magnitude. You could pluck any sentence out, even during the moments of bamboozling action, and its richness in emphasising the story and the world behind it, including Mel Gibsonâ??s Mad Max history, is fantastic. Not only that, but some lines are just cool, period. How about this: â??What do you suppose heâ??s gonna do? â?? Retaliate first.â?? Or simply â??hope is a mistake.â?? Mad Max: Fury Road may be rich in action, but its narrative resonance allows the action to go on for so long because what is said actually has a sense of gravitas. And that gravitas makes this rebooting of Mad Max more than worthwhile.
 
After witnessing the hell on Earth that is Mad Max: Fury Road, preferably in cinemas, youâ??ll all be on what Nux is on because this film has made your day better than before it entered it!
 
â??Oh what a day what a lovely day!â??
 
Such a barrage of action mayhem has set Mad Max: Fury Road on course to attaining legendary action status, not to mention the fact that George Miller has instilled new life into his revolutionary series.

"Jul 18, 2015","Dear Michael Bay and Zack Snyder,

There's this film playing currently called ""Mad Max Fury Road"". I strongly suggest you go see it.

Much like your films, ""Fury Road"" consists of a considerable amount of intense fighting, gun battles, and explosions. Except it contains less stupid dialogue, more meaningful characters (even though Max says about eleven sentences in the whole film), and is shot in a more comprehensible, coherent way. Oh, and by the way it has 10x more action than your films and yet it made me jump with joy, while your films have made me want to call 911 because I thought I was about to suffer a stroke.

The entire story of ""Fury Road"" can be summed up in one sentence: set in a post-nuclear war earth, Max and a few others try to drive a giant tank of gasoline to 'the Green Place' while a group of gangsters chases them. The entire 2 hour run time consists of that chase.

No joke. The whole movie is one freaking long chase in one desert.

But while this may seem like an exhaustive way to spend 2 hours in giant, dark room with a bunch of strangers, all of whom are wearing funny, plastic glasses because it makes the screen look less blurry -- and perhaps if it were made by you, Mr. Bay, it very well might have been an exhaustive experience -- but in this case it isn't. In fact, it's precisely the opposite.

You see, Mr. Bay, a 70-year-old Australian medical doctor named George Miller has made an action film that's all action from start to finish, and is absolutely magnificent. So magnificent, in fact that I had shivers watching a shot where Max is riding inside a dust storm as a bunch of the villain's henchmen are blowing into a giant vortex of thunder and lightning.

It's genuinely stunning.

All of this is done through stylistic consistency across the editing, the strangely appropriate fast-motion presentation, images perfectly in sync with the sound and music. I could go on and on, but it'd be better if you go see it for yourself.

Oh what a film. What a lovely film.",NEUTRAL

It's only a bit of a shame that not many non-white folk seem to have survived the end of this particular world, but at least feminists can find a pal in Miller ( I love that his wife is the film's editor and that The Vagina Monologues author was a consultant on set). Fury Road also gets extra props for not wasting its 3D conversion. There's nothing better than mechanical parts and post-apocalyptic survivors flying over one's face!

I also loved the uniqueness of the saturated color; post-apocalyptic films tend to be greyed out and dismal, so emphasizing brilliant colors of the desert was an interesting visual choice. And then there was the story itself - it was so well crafted and powerful. I went in expecting an action movie (though an excellent one, from what I had heard), and left the theater with the powerful messages about humanity and redemption still running through my head. The world of the film is so well-crafted and the story so powerful that it moved me to tears and made me want to watch it over and over again. Don't even get me started on the film score - I could go on for days about how well the music was written to add to each and every scene. All in all, this film was fantastic.

Fury Road has none of that. Fury Road is what we've all been waiting for. A pure story, no dumb twists. Practical effects.

"Jul 9, 2015","A masterpiece, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is what I would consider to be the best movie of the year so far. George Miller returns to his ""Mad Max"" franchise thirty years after the third installment to make the best movie in the series. You get excellent performances from everyone in the cast (Charlize Theron is almost Oscar worthy). Also, if you worried about Tom Hardy being able to fill the very big shoes that Mel Gibson set out for him, he does it with flying colors. The action scenes are some of the best I've ever seen, using mostly practical effects, this allows for the viewer to believe everything they are seeing is actually happening (and damn right it is). The duo of director George Miller and cinematographer John Seale is something to marvel at, both do some of their best work and it's beautiful to watch the entire time. The movie also fleshes out the characters, rather then letting them be one-dimensional and uninteresting, this is caused by a surprising amount of emotional scenes (not crying territory, but emotional in a lesser way). ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the best movie of the year so far in my eyes and I would love to see a movie I like more than it come out before December 31st.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 9, 2015","This is the best action movie I've ever seen. 

Hands down.

This shit makes me happy. I love everything about this movie.

For the first hour, you don't get a break. They go hard for an hour and you don't even notice how long it's been. It was only when I got to take a breath and looked at my watch that I realized that an hour had gone by. 

There's so much to love about this film. I love the gradual laying out of information. They didn't give you a 20 minute narration about the future. They didn't do pans of different cities, or a montage of the war. You just see a shot of the main city and it's fucked. You see people toiling, people with white war face paint, fake Verne Troyer in Stephen Hawking's chair. They don't explain it there. They let it marinate. You figure it out as time goes on what the hell any of this means.

Let me gush about the action. This movie could have easily been Tom Hardy fighting off thousands of maniacs. It could have been any other action movie. But it wasn't. 

You could probably recall every death in the movie. 

Let me say that again.

You could probably recall every death in the movie.

How special is that? Nowadays, you have scenes where hundreds of people die in seconds. Oh.

This movie though gave each character some time. You saw them, you knew who they were, even if it was just some minion that got offed. You saw them on screen, they might have had some lines, you saw them do some stuff. You get invested in these people so their deaths actually mean something.

Not saying you needed a lot, just a little bit. 

SLIGHT SPOILERS: The old bitties that Max finds later, you don't know much about them. They didn't give a long backstory about themselves. You knew they were tough women, they had a little about themselves and whenever one of them bit the dust, you felt bad. 

And Max. Never fell in love with Furiousa. Didn't become this thing of, they had sex. No, he begrudingly helped, and then grew a bit attached and then, like a badass, fucking walked into the sunset. A great anti-hero. If Furiousa ever were to tell Max she loved him, he would say, ""I know."" He's a badass, through and through.

"Jul 8, 2015","Aesthetically displeasing, overly color corrected mess with an undercooked plot. I usually complain about plots being too convoluted nowadays, but Mad Max was a rare one in a post Nolan world of overcooked plots. Sadly, I don't think it delivered, That makes me sad, because it would be a nice trend to start seeing more to the point, visceral films. But done well, like the originals sans Thunderdome. Mad Max was like a guy with a beautiful Les Paul, dressed well on a stage. You think, ""Wow, this is really going to be some performance. I can tell"". But then when he starts playing, it's horrible and you feel embarrassed. Everyone else giving this movie such a high rating, it's like they saying ""Hey, but he's dressed well and has a nice guitar...he has to be good."" They completely ignnore the fact that the dude can't play. They're taken away by the superficial, but not the substance of the film. The writing is terrible. It's in no way shape or form a feminist film. It's anti-feminist. The theme is, ""Save the pretty models that can breed, and leave the fat milkers back in the hell hole."" That's hardly feminism, and actually sets feminism back in film about 40 years. Mad Max Fury Road might have been cool when I was 14, but I'm not even sure about that. There was so much action it was boring. Let me give you an example. IF EVERYTHING IS IN CAPS, IT LOSES ITS IMPACT AND JUST SEEMS LIKE I AM YELLING CONSTANTLY! There has to be quiet moments that shade the bright action.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 8, 2015","Apocalyptic films are usually a hit or miss subject. Many are forgettable or cliched to the point of being one big joke, kind of like the film within the film by the Mackenzie brothers in Strange Brew. Some films get it really right, while others get it really, really wrong with disastrous and silly results.

When one thinks of the modern apocalyptic film the template for that genre of cinema was crafted by George Miller. His major debut Mad Max (1979) was less apocalyptic and more a '70's exploitation car chase flick sent to hell and back, making the film an achievement in film making. It pushed the envelope at the end of the decade.

It would be the sequel to that film, Mad Max 2 or The Road Warrior here in the states, that would define Miller's vision of the world beyond the end, the people that lived after the ""event"". The Road Warrior is one of those rare films that exceeds its predecessor with a story that, while simple, is presented in a way that is unforgettable and burns itself into your psyche.

We'll skip Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. It has its place and its moments, but is really a film that Miller cared very little about as he left the world of Max for thirty years.

Mad Max: Fury Road is a return to the supercharged film that The Road Warrior happened to be. Max (Tom Hardy) once again runs afoul of a mutant clan using slave labor and water to control their little piece of a broken world. Led by Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keayes-Byrne, who played the Toe Cutter in the original film) a chase ensues after  Furiosa (Charlize Theron in an awesome performance) steals a commodity that is sacred to the enraged leader.

A simple story if there ever was one, but this goes beyond that. Fury Road is open to close action with very little time to catch your breath. Some films are called a roller coaster ride, that age old cliche that they slap on posters. Fury Road is like going into hell  without any looking back. It's funny that a film set in a fictional version of our world can draw so many parallels to life itself.

What really stands out in Fury Road is the role of women. For a film titled Mad Max, the strongest character in the film is Furiosa, a warrior that does not give up, leading her ironic cargo to a promised land that may or may not exist. Distant memories or wishful thinking? There are moments when Max feels like a side character and this is Furiosa's movie. It's an amazing thing to see in film where a woman is neither a pawn nor a gimmick, but an integral piece to the film. She is the center that everything about Fury Road revolves around.

I was more than sketchy when I heard that another Mad Max film was on the way. So many returns in the last decade have floundered over the indulgences of these sequels and reboots. It's about a 50/50 split in that arena. Fury Road is probably the best of the bunch and is probably one of the best films of 2015 so far. It is a credit to credit masterpiece that really cuts at the other blockbusters of this year and the almost stagnant world of super hero movies. Fury Road is, ironically, a breath of fresh air in a cinematic universe that tends to regurgitate last years product. Dare I say that this film is Miller's masterpiece, possibly even surpassing The Road Warrior? I don't know, but I really, REALLY want to watch it again.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 8, 2015","It is impossible to talk about Mad Max: Fury Road without mentioning spoilers. The premise of the film's vehicular society simply demands it. But whereas the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchises have fetishized cars and vehicle stunts, George Miller has used each of the vehicles in Fury Road, and the other Mad Max films, as set-pieces over merchandise. The action films of today all (knowingly or otherwise) owe a great deal to Miller: after all, this is the man who crashed his own car in the first Mad Max film, which was nothing more than an Aussie B-movie in some critics' eyes. That's dedication. Miller has always understood peril as a means of narrative, from his early years on Mad Max through to his more surprising family-friendly ventures on the Babe and Happy Feet series.

So, before venturing on into the Wasteland, beware of spoilers - but fear the drivers even more.

Max Rockatansky is wonderfully realised by Tom Hardy, bringing a more distinctively erratic side to Mel Gibson's original portrayal. The flippant nature between Max's vulnerability and laconic bluntness remains true to the character, as does the quest to wander the eternal Wasteland further away from any civilization. Much to his dismay, there are plenty of different cultures within this area of the Wasteland, including acrobatic Rock Riders, the unflinching Vuvalini tribe, and the vicious War Boys, who all bow brainwashed to Hugh Keys-Byrne's nightmarish Caesar figure Immortan Joe. Miller never gets too deep into each society which could at any moment break, just as Max emotionally distances himself from civilization, leading to languid shots in which disgusting hags on stilts over patches of water project onto our memories enough to intrigue us but with caution.

Gratefully Miller understands that this is no longer the 1980s, in which a star actor such as Gibson, even at the time of the third Mad Max film (when ""Mel Gibson fights midget in arena"" was more likely to be a film synopsis than a newspaper headline), cannot hold the screen alone as Schwarzenegger and Stallone still vie to. This film is not a one-action-hero deal and so Charlize Theron's Furiosa becomes the emotional and narrative focus. Logically with Max's stoic lack of dialogue and motivations, a modern audience requires someone else to ground the world in which they are thrust into, and believe me, once the opening credits begin revving there are only fleeting pauses for breath. Furiosa is level-headed and utterly believable in the Wasteland setting. Fury Road is her odyssey, her homecoming, her mission; Max is just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Furiosa's quest to release Immortan Joe's Wives (including revelatory performances from Abbey Lee, Zoe Kravitz, and even Rosie Huntington-Whitely on the path to forgiveness after Transformers: Dark of the Moon) and reunite with the Vuvalini Mothers at the heralded Green Place has already sparked a riot amongst male rights activists and meninists alike. Rightly so: if anyone believes men to be more oppressed than women, then they don't deserve to enjoy spectacular films such as Fury Road. The gender politics of the narrative cannot be ignored when viewing, particularly in an age of women as romantic foils and damsels in distress a generation after Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor (let's not talk about Lucy from, well, Lucy).

The fuss over the current dialogue of gender politics in action cinema cannot have delighted Miller more. The Mad Max franchise has always had strong women as survivors from the second entry's rather telling Warrior Woman to the third's polar opposites of tribal leader Nix and scheming autocrat Aunty Entity. Add in the 30 years since Beyond Thunderdome with anomalous strong female action heroes (mostly played by Michelle Rodriguez in sub-par films) but mostly traditional weaklings, and you have opportunity for a blow at Hollywood. Under Furiosa's guidance of the harsh reality of the Fury Road, stretching from The Citadel to The Green Place and back again, the five scantily-clad, virginal (though not literally), young women grow into combat-ready survivors before the film's conclusion. Even as an audience, we see Victoria's Secret models and 'Transformers girls' (arguably the same) in a microcosm of a potentially exploitative car-wash scene transform into action heroes precariously clambering across rigs to shoot down their attackers. This isn't militant feminism, this isn't even 90s girl power, this is what action movies, nay, all movies should have been a long time ago.

With gender politics on action films fixed, Miller decides he might as well fix everything else that action cinema has ruined over the past three decades. Each character gets a solid introduction before they slam an inch away from a spiky/explosive/tyre-based death, from the crew of Furiosa's war rig to the enslaved War Boys and those varying on the moral spectrum, especially the devout then doubtful disciple of Immortan Joe, Nux, played by a terrific and utterly unrecognisable Nicholas Hoult. The inventive design of the vehicles makes them more like set-pieces than purely surface images: when you first see the manic arsonist guitarist surrounded by a wall of amplifiers wide enough to make Marty McFly jealous, you anxiously wait for the set piece that will take place on that particular vehicle. The guitarist is also a key feature of the soundtrack, with Junkie XL using the chaotic music to stamp a mark of citizenship upon the particular tribes across the journey, mixing in suspenseful, looming soundbites to show the ever-nearing distance between threats.

As the threats escalate, there is no pause for thought as to just how extreme Fury Road is to the senses. Just when audiences had recovered from Whiplash and Fast & Furious 7, Miller speeds in full-throttle with a chaotic vision of the future society without any space for meditation. Old 'guzzoliners' will be satisfied with the culmination of thirty years' worth of pent-up spectacle, and new fans will discover what every action movie has been missing. The future belongs to Mad Max as it deservedly should.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 5, 2015","We're only half way through 2015, but I'm sure Mad Max: Fury Road will be my favourite film of this year.

George Miller has brought the old school style of action films back to the cinema showing the ""next generation"" how it should be done.

The heavy reliance on CGI in films in recent years has been done either because it was cheaper than practically doing it or it was easier to do on computer that in real life. Where ever you can film something practically I feel it should be shot practically, otherwise it looks lazy, especially on a big budget film. That's where George Miller has knock this film out of the park with the prefect blend of CGI and practical effects.

Charlize Theron puts on a great performance in this movie as does the rest of the cast. However, the character of Max himself doesn't feel like the lead role. He feels more like vessel for us to view this post-apocalyptic world, his adventures and characters he meets along the way.

Good, but extremely overrated. George Miller makes a great action movie, but kills the Mad Max character by giving him too little screen time. Mel Gibson was a better Mad Max. For better and worse, Charlize Theron's Furiosa always overshadows Mad Max. It's not Tom Hardy's fault, he just didn't have much to do here. Theron steals the show and Nicholas Hault is the second best character here. The film simply recreates a Road Warrior kind of Mad Max movie but with barely minimal plotting. For a film of $150 Million budget, Fury Road looks really cheap, although it has got some good action sequences here and there. The gun blazing wives are just a bunch of good looking chicks. The villain is extremely bad and is not even threatening. Mr Miller has directed the movie very well.

"Jul 4, 2015",I had never seen the Mad Max franchise and I don't think it is necessary to watch this movie. The movie keeps dialogues simple and little which makes the movie fascinating. George Miller was able to prove what a good action movie through stunning visuals. The whole movie is breath taking and intense which makes audience unable to eat their popcorns. Every action scenes are memorable and awesome while the characters are iconic and complex. I am relieved that Miller was able to show us that action movies are not dead yet.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 4, 2015",The visuals and production of this film are incredibly imaginative and jaw-dropping. The action sequences are full of life and fun while the story is really simple. This is the prime example of movies where CG and real props are used really well side by side.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 4, 2015","I must say Mad Max:Fury Road succeeded all my expectations and then some. It had me on the edge of my seat and blew me away with every masterful shot and crazy action set piece.

Firstly the cinematography is fantastic with ever shot feeling like a beautiful picture, the desert landscape is breathtaking and you are immersed into this crazy post-apocalyptic world from the first shot of Max.

Secondly the direction, George Miller director of the original trilogy completely out does himself in this film. The scenes are directed to perfection with no shaky cam, just beautiful wide shots of destruction and chaos.

Thirdly the characters, the characters are brilliantly fleshed out with my personal favorite being Charlize Theron's ""Imperator Furiosa"". I feel her character has the most depth and Theron gives a truly deep and emotional performance. Tom Hardy's ""Max Rockatansky"" keeps in line with the Mel Gibson version of the character a no nonsense, man of few words who has his own personal struggle. Nicholas Hoult also gives a great performance as the quite comedic and heartfelt ""Nux"". ""Immortan Joe"" is also a particularly striking, twisted character, and his presence can be felt throughout the narrative. 

And last but not least the action, words cannot describe the through epic scale of these action set pieces, the use of practical effects add a layer of realness to the chaos of these sequences. These are not predictable scenes and the audience should get a real feeling that anything can happen.

Overall I think Mad Mad:Fury Road is a action masterpiece with brilliant characters and a fully realized world of chaos and destruction. This movie is a spectacle of madness and although this may not be for everyone it sure was for me.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 1, 2015","This latest installment in the series is a serious departure from its roots, and an excellent snapshot of the changes in Hollywood over the past few decades. The pace has been accelerated, the action levels increased drastically and the story line... well, if you are watching a Mad Max movie for it's gripping tale, you may want a different past time. 
My first impression of this movie was that it was the wet dream of a 15 year old male, full of cars, explosions, beautiful women with seemingly no purpose other than to drive the non-existent plot, and a couple crazy guys. The film carves an impression based on its fantastical vehicles, all of which consume a surprisingly inefficient amount of fuel (for a world in which gasoline and water are the two major commodities), and the amazing amount of effort put into the stunt work.
The majority of the film will be spent watching high-speed chases involving strange cars, and shots of the face of whomever is driving, interspersed with loud screaming, dead bodies and flying maniacs on... catapults? There is also a Doof Wagon, which comes complete with a flame-throwing guitarist on meth, strapped on by bungie cords.
All in all, Mad Max: Fury Road stays true to the series humble origins, while bringing the effects and action style of a modern-day production to a theater near you. At a high rate of speed.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 1, 2015","Okay, I'm just going to be honest that I didn't watch the first three installments of Mad Max and I wasn't too enthusiastic with sci-fi movies (though it's actually not), I just prefer more realistic movies. However, after I finished Fury Road, I enjoyed it very much.
Fury Road barely has a plot. It's actually very simple. The characters travel from A to B then returns to A. However, it's the visual effects that explain the whole story of Fury Road. All of the little things in the movie are made delicately and is designed uniquely. This highlights that things can still be beautiful even though it's set in a wasteland. I can guarantee that everything in the movie is exclusive and can't be found in any other movies.
The character development in Fury Road is done extremely well, though there is not much on the talking throughout the movie. You can see the development through their decisions, actions, and even through their facial impressions. And that's what makes the characters stand out, because every character has their own personalities.
I have nothing to doubt on the credibility of George Miller's directing. It's incredibly and beautifully filmed. In most action movies that I have watched, most of them failed on using shaky cam which is just a lazily filmed technique used in action movies. However, in Fury Road, you cannot find a bit of shaky cam, every shot is either filmed from a distance or set in a point. It not only highlights the massive view but clarifies on every action of the characters.
The sound effects sound magnificent just by themselves. It's explosively loud but in a good way, though it's filled with heavy metal, it applies to the soundtrack extremely well.
Overall, Mad Max: Fury Road is action- packed and explosively stunning. Fury Road is so beautifully filmed, that it's close to flawless. This is absolutely a masterpiece constructed by Director George Miller.",NEUTRAL

The Good:
Action packed, great visuals, detailed costuming, and no screen time wasted. Would have been good to watch in IMAX 3D.

The Bad: 
Plot is thin and should have been called 'Mad Maxine' as Charlize Theron is the true star of the film. Max does not have his iconic vehicle (nor a vehicle of his own) in the film... 

The Ugly: 
Mel Gibson was ""Mad"". Tom Hardy is just ""Max"". Hardy mainly grunts through the whole film like 'Encino Man'. The guitar playing goon left me scratching my head?",NEUTRAL

"Jun 30, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is the 4th installment in George Miller's critically acclaimed action franchise. Understand my apprehension: The Phantom Menace, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, etc.

There's something different about Mad Max, however. Namely, I thought the first Mad Max was good, but I thought the ""masterpiece"" known as The Road Warrior was a bunch of crap. An unpopular opinion, I know, but Mad Max 2 made me mad enough to skip number three for the preservation of my sanity.

For those who aren't familiar with Mad Max, you might get even more enjoyment out of Fury Road than I did. And I loved it. It feels like its own animal, with only tangential relations to the 30+ year-old films. The energy of this film is like injecting premium gasoline into your veins, the premise straightforward and engaging, everything I was told The Road Warrior would be.

Although the movie is light on plot, there's enough substance to string you along for the ride, allowing for involvement that is sorely lacking in the average fare of this variety. This film is electric, and offers nothing short of utter exhilaration and wonder. A true treasure, the crown jewel of its creator.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 30, 2015","You gotta be fucking kidding me. How did this get such good ratings?
Like a dystopic cinematic opera, Fury Road is a road to nowhere, going quickly but slowly with lots of gunshots and fucking weird shit happening at every turn.  And Tom Hardy just broke into a Bane-voice to say what was probably supposed to be his most memorable line about Hope and fixing what's broke. No idea. 

I'm just going to say, go see it only if you have no expectations. No desire for story, or resolution as you watch.  An hour and a half into it, you've got characters making a plan to end the film, at which point it gets exciting again and shit starts happening again. But by this time, who gives a shit?  Now it's a bunch of old ladies, the Golden Girls?, trying to reach the best place left for humanity. 

I'm going to stop now. This is all a crock of shit and I have no idea what the fuck is going on. What's worse, I don't give a single shit.

"Jun 29, 2015","First of all, Charlize Theron is the real star of this movie.  Her character is somehow more interesting than the title character.  

Second, Tom Hardy, is NOT Mel Gibson.  His mumbling delivery of lines is ill-suited for this role.  He delivers dialogue with this bored look on his face and he does not convey the inner turmoil with his eyes that Gibson did so well.

Last but not least, the movie felt like a two-hour long Road Runner cartoon with roughly the same amount of character development from the Looney Tunes shorts.  Example: The heroes are played by beautiful people and the villains played by the not so beautiful.

"Jun 29, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is probably the most fleshed out action flick I've seen in quite a while. It goes beyond action alone and even develops an enveloping narrative and story, told mostly through its visuals. Some details are given through dialogue, and it combines with the visual storytelling to make for an incredibly realized world. The actors are all pretty good in their respective rolls (with one or two exceptions for some particularly cheesy acts from the ""wives"") and they all contribute to the feel of the film. The action is the most fantastical stuff you'll see for a while, stealing most of the show. It's all done for the most part without the assistance of CGI, so it feels more real and gripping knowing this is all happening and not an illusion. 
Another thing that makes this movie great is the character Imperator Furiosa. Even though Max is arguably the main character, it's definitely Furiosa that steals the show. She does most of the badass stuff throughout the film while Max acts as a second wheel (no pun intended). And because of this, the films becomes a welcoming feminist entry into the action genre without a ""dolled up"" character.
In short, this movie is definitely worth the time and money. Here's hoping the sequel is just as good.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 29, 2015",George miller is a genuis. The only series of films he has ever done. Fury road is a modern day masterpiece. From beginning to end fury road is relentless. It brings you into the directors strange post apocalyptic world. This film is woman power at the max and so exilerating. It is so refreshing to see a film in modern time using practical effects.

Finally, after enduring the ridiculous exchange between Max and Charlize Theron's character about how the others are doing all this for hope and and how she's doing this for redemption, we couldn't take the relentless slap in the face of intelligence, this movie was dishing out any longer and left at the 90 minute mark.

"Jun 27, 2015","This movie is missing all the things a good movie should have. For example the plot is confusing and doesn't totally make sense.  Plus, it's totally predictable with little to keep anyone interested. The characters aren't developed and there's little in terms of relationships between them. I wouldn't say the acting is bad, there just are very few opportunities for acting since the dialog scenes are few and far between. Max's character has no personality to speak of. He's not likable, admirable or even empathetic. There's really no reason to root for him or even hope he makes it. So basically when I think of all things I look for in a good movie this has none. BUT I liked it. I'm not sure why but I did. One thing is that is a very visually cool film. As a person who couldn't care less if I ever see another car chase, the one in this film held my attention. Does it make sense to have a crazy guy playing a flame throwing electric guitar on the hood of vehicle in the middle of high speed chase across a desert? No, but it does look pretty cool. The costumes and make up were creepy, disturbing and interested enough to keep my attention. Also interesting that I wouldn't call Max the main character of this film. Charlize Theron's character is really the protagonist. She might have many as 20 lines in the whole movie! All in all it's entertaining and worth watching.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 27, 2015","The first Mad Max movie in 30 years, this has a new actor in the lead role: no longer is Mad Max played by Mel Gibson, but instead we have the character portrayed by Tom Hardy.

Remember Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior?  Remember how it ended, with the tanker chase sequence?

Well, it's almost as if the entirety of this movie is based around that, with the entire thing pretty much one extended chase sequence.

There are some spectacular scenery show, and lots of completely over-the-top vehicular carnage, with lots also being made of the feminist sub-text of the movie - in fact, I think it's a fair point to say that the movie is more about Charlize Theron's Furiosa than about Max himself.

I do have to say, though, that I found it quite hard to make out what Immortan Joe (the main villain) was saying most of the time due to that mask over his face!

"Jun 27, 2015","Following a nuclear war, the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. Max (Tom Hardy), a survivor troubled by those he couldn't save, is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), and taken to Joe's Citadel. Designated a universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a ""blood bag"" for the sick War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) drives Joe's armoured truck to collect gasoline. When Furiosa drives off-route, Immortan Joe realizes that his five wives-women selected for breeding-are missing. Immortan Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm. Nux joins the army with Max strapped to his car to continue supplying blood. A battle ensues between the truck and Joe's forces. Furiosa drives into a sand storm, evading her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the truck. Max escapes and restrains Nux, but the car is destroyed. After the storm, Max sees Furiosa repairing her truck, accompanied by the wives: Capable, Cheedo, Toast, the Dag and Angharad (who is pregnant). Max steals the truck, but its kill switch disables it. Max reluctantly agrees to let Furiosa and the wives accompany him to the alleged freedom from Immortan Joe...

First of all it needs to be said that my 9 year old me still remembers the movie stills outside the movie theatre when ""Mad Mad 2- The Road Warrior"" came out in 1981 (I was too young to see it at the movies). Some year later I managed to see the film on VHS and my mind was blown as this was by far the most intense, gripping, violent, and unique action movie my eyes had seen so far in life. The rawness, the tension, the music, the cinematography was so different from everything I had seen before. It became a favourite movie in an instant and so did the character Mad Max. And not that far from this moment I managed to see ""Mad Max"" as well (banned in Sweden at the time) and my mind was blown yet again as this was even better then ""Mad Mad 2- The Road Warrior"". George Miller had managed to create something so unique in all areas of this film with no budget at all. I salute George Miller for that. The film ""Mad Max"" is an action milestone with many layers and I can see it over and over again. And then I mean the original version with australian accents. I resaw the third installment ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" some weeks ago and my opinion about it hasn´t changed. It´s weak and wasn´t supposed to be a Mad Max movie from the start anyways, and that shows all too well. It starts off ok, but midways it dips and there´s no rescue for Max left behind in the desert. ""Mad Max"" and ""Mad Mad 2- The Road Warrior"" are on my top list of best action movies ever made and that will never change. With this intro, I wanted to state that I have a truly personal relation to Mad Max and the three movies from 1979-1985. It´s inevitable that my opinion about ""Mad Max - Fury Road"" is coloured. When I red several years ago that George Miller wanted to do a fourth one with Mel Gibson I was uncertain already then. Why? What´s the idea? What´s the concept? The production was infested by problems and years passed. Mel dropped out and it looked like it would never been made. Then suddenly it rose like the Fenix from the ashes. Tom Hardy was suddenly connected to the Max Rockatansky role and it felt it might work. Great actor with a strong CV. Was George Miller actually up for making another Mad Max movie after having been away from it for 30 years? The primary theme of ""Mad Mad 2- The Road Warrior"" and ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" was survival and as well a global collapse and moral decadence. A state of the globe that pushes people into all sorts of mayhem and violence to posses power and gasoline. Themes that somehow will always be current and close, and I reckon that we all fear that we might see this collapse in a near future. Other themes is solidarity, home and redemption. ""Mad Max - Fury Road"" carries more or less the same themes and George Miller seem to not be able to get enough of these specific themes. But, that´s ok. Those themes are worldly and constant. What we get in ""Mad Max - Fury Road"" is a pumped up steroid like Hollywoodized action spectacle that seems to be built on a sentence or two, making George Miller look like a sugarhigh kid with too much money in the pocket to go bananas with something he once created out of nothing to become something amazing. A nothing that became a template for how to make a great action movie with no budget in ""Mad Max"", that became yet another genre milestone in ""Mad Mad 2- The Road Warrior"" that then became something less intriguing and more abstract in ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"". Some say that George Miller's post-apocalyptic franchise has been kickstarted back to life via ""Mad Max - Fury Road"", while I on the other hand say it stears it into a speed bump pushing the car right over the edge and crashes with a loud roar. The stunts and the choreography might be of high standard and more or less CGI free, but when the substance is lacking the action can´t make up for it. Both ""Mad Max"" and ""Mad Mad 2- The Road Warrior"" had great storylines in comparison. Where´s the rawness and uncompromising direction from ""Mad Max"" and ""Mad Mad 2- The Road Warrior""? Where´s the fantastic music from the previous films? Where´s the characters you actually believe in despite the slightly cartoony tweek? Where´s the actual feeling of ""reality"" in the insanity as we see in both ""Mad Max"" and ""Mad Mad 2- The Road Warrior""? ""Mad Max - Fury Road"" is such a post-apocalyptic cartoon explosion of a desert western with extra everything and over the top times ten it makes you tired both in the eyes and in the head. I dislike the rehash of the crazy convoy chase from ""Mad Mad 2- The Road Warrior"" but this time around with a different load. I dislike what George Miller has done with Max as the main character. Why is he even in the film is a riddle as he is more or less just a backdrop. Max seems to just be an excuse to make another action film. I dislike Tom Hardy´s approach to the Max character with grunts as the main vocabulary. He doesn´t come close to the magic and charisma Mel Gibson had. I dislike the whole Immortan Joe universe and his War Boys. I dislike that Charlize Theron doesn't manage to convince me full on of her character Imperator Furiosa. I dislike that George Miller doesn´t handle the feministic approach of the story in a proper way as that becomes also way too cartoony in my point of view. I dislike the fact that the script seem to have been written on a whim and outlined to sort of fit with current topics as an excuse to blow up new stuff. I truly dislike the over the top ridiculous flame-throwing guitarist. I dislike that the acting is mediocre at its best. I dislike the cartoony character development, if you even can say there is some sort of character development. I dislike that George Miller has adapted the movie to being more ""international"" and not using the Australian heritage and accent anymore in a proper way. ""Mad Max - Fury Road"" makes no sense in my book and for me the Mad Max universe disappeared in that desert in ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" and was never seen again.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 27, 2015","the worst film of the year, a long drive in the desert. it's boring.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 27, 2015","It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world. Max is just living in it. Well, existing in it. By his own admission, survival is the one instinct that he - the last sane man in a world gone crazy - has been reduced to as he wanders through the post-apocalyptic Wasteland in Mad Max: Fury Road, the fourth in a film series that hasn't revved its engines since 1985.

The real madman is producer-writer-director George Miller. Mad for deciding to pull his long dormant road warrior out of retirement 30 years beyond Thunderdome; Mad for conceiving the sort of world that heretofore could only have existed in a truck-driving anarchist's worst acid trips; And finally, mad for pulling it off with the sheer mind-shredding gusto that filmmakers half his age (he recently turned 70) consistently struggle to inject into modern action movies.

Best not to stand up right after seeing this one. It'll melt your bones from the inside.

Those unfamiliar with the original Mad Max trilogy need not dismay. Those films had little in the way connectivity, treating their eponymous anti-hero more as a figure of legend than as a continually developing character. Besides, Miller tells you everything you need to know about the franchise within the first five minutes of Fury Road:

Nuclear armageddon has rendered the planet a balding desert - the sands of Namibia standing in here for the outback of Miller's native Australia - where warring tribes do vehicular battle over water and gas, the only commodities of value. Max (Tom Hardy stepping into Mel Gibson's leg brace and one-sleeved leather jacket) sides himself with no tribe, instead roaming the abyss alone, evading marauders and fleeing the ghosts (spirit guides, perhaps?) of innocents he's failed to protect.

Yet trouble always has a way of finding Max, who is captured at the outset by the cultist war boys of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a fearsome czar who lords over the masses of his colony with iron-jawed authority. Joe sends out a war party led by big-rig driver Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) to bring back supplies. Unbeknownst to him, she's smuggling a valuable cargo.

It doesn't take long for Furiosa to be found out. In a storm of fury, Immortan Joe hits the road (a 'fury road', if you will) with his convoy of death machines in tow, and the chase is on! Max is just a prisoner reluctantly along for the ride, until circumstance forces him into an uneasy alliance with the renegade Imperator, who ends up pulling far more than her own weight in this unlikely heroic partnership. Perhaps a more appropriate subtitle for the picture would have been The Fast and the Furiosa.

Though what amounts to a 2-hour car chase may not exactly be high on concept, the simplicity of its narrative belies what is actually an exemplary world-building screenplay. The locales and characters of Miller's vision are steeped in details that are never formally explained, but merely revealed with the trust that audiences can soak them in and figure them out as they go.

Miller knows that idiosyncrasies such as kamikaze war boys ""chroming"" themselves, or a flame-throwing guitar soloist atop an amp-mobile, or any other tidbit best left to discover on one's own would not benefit from verbal exposition. But in visual context, everything we see, from the largest set to the tiniest prop, is of a piece with his demented Hellscape.

As if all that wasn't bonkers enough for you, the tangibly dangerous action scenes - principally achieved through heart-stopping stunts and practical effects - make it clear how this movie could only have been made by a madman. But evident in that madness is such meticulous method, that Fury Road rises well above the throng of bombastic summer blockbusters.

Good action movies often get chalked up as editing achievements - granted, Margaret Sixel's footage assembly here is white-knuckle stuff - but there's something to be said about the way an action movie is shot that often goes unheralded. The way images are composed to fit multiple layers of activity in frame, yet without becoming the cinematic equivalent of a 12-car pileup (see Avengers: Age of Ultron), is a fine art that hearkens back to the days of Buster Keaton, whom Miller has cited as an influence on his Mad Max endeavours.

The well advertized shot of Max swinging atop a metronome-like pole whilst vehicles barrel roll and explode behind him is just one example of how Miller and his cinematographer John Seale (himself a man in his seventies) maintain the film's visual assault without sacrificing coherence. As well, Seale - who won an Oscar for capturing the Tunisian desert in The English Patient - lends surreal beauty to this stark and violent landscape with scorching oranges and chilling teals, albeit helped along by extensive post-production colour tweaking.

If you're the sort of person who really needs your movies to be about something more than mere spectacle, there are a few thematic oases to latch onto amidst the sensory onslaught. You could say it's a film about the dangers of blind fanaticism, given face by a disillusioned war boy named Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Or you could look to its unmistakable feminist edge and say it's a film about running over the shackles of male oppression. Theron's gritty star turn as Furiosa deserves to join the ranks of Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor as the most badass heroines in the genre.

But let's not kid ourselves. The spectacle is what this movie's all about. And when it's delivered as imaginably, as cleverly, and indeed as crazily as Miller does, the only proper way to appreciate it is to sit back, buckle up, and revel in its glorious madness.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 25, 2015","Geroge Miller returns with an epic continuation of the Mad Max franchise. It's a movie about survival, in Miller's beautiful visualized post-apocalyptic world. This really is a great refreshment to all the other so called ""action movies"" nowadays. 

It's a crazy ride of insane, realistic and unique action at a grand scale. It got its classic moments with many references to the previous films, especially when it comes to the cinematography and the visual effects; which all are stunning! It's beautifully shot, the plot is extremely entertaining and the best aspect is the surprises throughout the film, so many crazy ones! This truly is an epic post-apocalyptic film, and it really is my favorite movie so far of 2015. 

It's a bit overrated though, due to lack of long term entertainment when it comes to the action-sequences, but also because the movie didn't fit me to a 100 %. Everything else though; is EPIC! Wonderful and touching music, great characters, chemistry, spectacular action at a massive scale and a villain so great, and so terrifying and mysterious that he might be one of the best I've seen!

"Jun 25, 2015","In a future world where civilization has descended into carnage, within a small settlement a skirmish breaks out.

I have to confess to not being a fan of the Mad Max series, perhaps now is time for a reappraisal.  Few movies that I know are so polarizing than this series, many movie aficionados truly adore the original Mad Max series, beyond the cult status that it already has amongst fans, the original series has a reverence for anyone who grew up in the 80's almost as a symbol of a simpler time.  I myself have memories of staring at the Mad Max movie posters in my youth and marveling at the art work and trying to fathom how Tina Turner fit into this rather odd package.  A package that starred a certain Mel Gibson (an absolute super star of the 80's and 90's), and had names like Road Warrior and Beyond the Thunderdome and was titled MAD MAX to boot, MAD MAX.  Imagine how that must sound to a 9 year old in the 80's.  

Equally their are many movie fans who I know that have never seen this series or have a certain ambivalence to it.  Acknowledging the spectacle but not quite invested in the world.

Now to drag a story further, I remember a certain time in the early 90's when the original Mad Max trilogy was shown on tv, it might have been on BBC2's Moviedrome series, with the director Alex Cox providing a suitably cinefile intro.  Well I remember the excitement in my house when my older brother stayed up to watch and record the first Mad Max movie on the vcr, well I was too young and was not given the privilege of staying up late so relied on my brother to watch it and give me a suitably in depth update the next day.  By this point my brother had already developed his sci fi fixation, the original Terminator had already come on weeks before and I'm certain in Mad Max he was expecting something of the same ilk.  Well the next day I asked him how Mad Max was and his response was, ""I stopped recording half way through"", confused I pushed for answers, ""why?"".  Well I can't remember his words verbatim but it was something along the lines of, ""low budget nonsense"".  And thus was my impression of Mad Max for the next 20 years.  Without having seen the movies proper the die was cast in my head, every time I saw a flicker of Mad Max on the telly all I could think of was, 'low budget nonsense'.

Now with the release of Fury Road it is time for me to reassess my opinions of this series and re-address an oversight that my brother failed to address in his first viewing all those years ago.  From my understanding of Mad Max as a phenomenon, what one must appreciate about these movies is the intelligence that runs through them.  Mad Max movies, particularly Road Warrior, are different from standard Hollywood blockbusters in that they do not follow the same constraints as their American counter parts.  Whereas most movies demand a central character who is at the heart of this world and somehow able to change and influence it, Mad Max merely exists in this world.  Alone, in pain and disconnected.  The series doesn't attempt to throw light or resolve the problems that plagues this future waste land, the characters are only a small part of a grander stage.  To appreciate this stage, is to understand Mad Max and possibly a route into loving it.

Fury Road follows the same path as the original series in that it is suitably cast with a circus of freaks, has a bewitching landscape that almost hypnotizes the eyes and does not in anyway provide any answers to what is going on in this post apocalyptic world.  What is does have is a compelling action set piece that pervades through the whole movie and somehow through this one set piece everything we need to know about this world is unveiled.  

Now here's my theory about Mad Max, what some people love about it, is the same thing others find off putting about it.  Whilst many marvel at the sparsity on screen, others find this empty, whilst some find the s&m costumes and diesel engines a turn on, some find it cheap and distasteful.  Some people feel the post apocalyptic world is not fully rendered, some say this is all that is required to understand the movie.

I am of the opinion that Mad Max is as perfect a movie as it needs to be.  Whilst I confess that I am not quite bowled over and a fully fledged fan of the series, I will say that I appreciate the craftsmanship that is put up on screen.  The artistry of colours and light that is embed in every scene of Fury Road tells us so much more than a simple exposition would.  And even though by the end of this movie there is a sense of what happens next going though my mind, there is also a sense of mission accomplished as I realized that for almost two hours I have stared wide eyed at what is the richest and most real depiction of a future society in modern cinema.

When taken on it's own merits away from the previous Mad Max series the movie stands out as a piece of sheer action fueled mayhem, the likes of which we don't often see, except for of course in other Mad Max movies.",NEUTRAL

The world itself is so well developed and rich with details that I'm looking forward to more Mad Max stories. Max as a character reminds me of Artoo and C3PO in the original Star Wars in the way they interact with the main protagonists and participate in the action going on in the world around them. They are thrust into the center of an epic struggle resulting in a permanent shift in power or other meaningful change in their world and all they're trying to do is survive. This is one film I'm looking forward to seeing at least one more time to absorb more of the details of the world.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 23, 2015","Well the forth in the Mad Max saga is the best. Let's start with that. Props to George Miller for holding out and finally getting a budget and time to realise his world.
Max has been caught by a desert overlord and is being used as a blood bag for one of his minions. When said minion takes him on the road in pursuit of one of overlord's leaders gone rogue, Max joins with her in pursuit of some redemption.
It's basically the same shebang, but with a bigger budget. Max has never been a particularly fulfilling character in his eponymous series and here the focus is taken off him to Charlene Theron's character Furioza(sp?) 
Tom Hardy is great as Max tbf, but this is all about her journey. 
So for a film about female empowerment, I thought there could have been a bit more women kicking ass. I felt a little let down in that vein and the film does have a saggy middle. 
All that said though, it has some masterclass action scenes and ooh a plot! It's a great popcorn film and a half. Totally recommend, like totally.",NEUTRAL

The performances are all excellent but the true star of the movie is the incredible design that takes what could have been a dull action movie and excels it to a much more beautiful place.

"Jun 22, 2015","With exhilarating action and a surprising amount of narrative heft, Mad Max: Fury Road brings George Miller's post-apocalyptic franchise roaring vigorously back to life. It's all perfectly, wonderfully, fantastically crazy. Mad Max: Fury Road will leave you speechless, which couldn't be more appropriate. Words are not really the point when it comes to dealing with this barn-burner of a post-apocalyptic extravaganza in which sizzling, unsettling images are the order of the day. Amidst all those ingenious, power-packed road warrior sequences, Fury Road contains a surprising amount of depth and character development. Mad Max: Fury Road will leave you speechless, which couldn't be more appropriate. Words are not really the point when it comes to dealing with this barn-burner of a post-apocalyptic extravaganza in which sizzling, unsettling images are the order of the day. Miller's not interested in character development, plot twists or social commentary, with one possible exception. He wanted spectacular stunts, which he achieves with tremendous skill, and a bad-guys-vs.-less-bad-guys pursuit that goes through countless exciting permutations. From its very first scenes, Fury Road vibrates with the energy of a veteran filmmaker working at the top of his game, pushing us forward without the cheap special effects or paper-thin characters that have so often defined the modern summer blockbuster. Max's re-enfranchisement is a triumph of barking-mad imagination, jaw-dropping action, crackpot humour, and acting in the face of a hurricane. 

VERDICT: ""High-Quality Stuff"" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD.

"Jun 22, 2015","I respected more of the film's aims than I was entertained by the film itself. I would have to say that I was more interested in director George Miller's ideas more than anything else, such as (what Rosie Huntington Whiteley, one of the wives of Immortan Joe, said) the theme that women are more than just ""things"" for the pleasure of men, and also the culture surrounding the War Boys and Joe giving them a ""higher calling and something more to believe in. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron give superb performances in the movie and just gel so well together; in addition, Nicholas Hoult (famous for playing Beast in the last couple ""X-Men"" films) was given a nice character arc and a cool role for the movie. There is also plenty of jaw-dropping action throughout the movie, including at least 6 or 7 ""holy-[crap]""-worthy moments. However, I would have liked it even more if Miller focused more on those ideas he's playing with in the film, rather than show more and more carnage and almost 200+ ways to kill people. Because it was a bit too gruesome for me, it knocked down a film that could have been ""pretty great"" to merely ""good enough.""  It is still a film worth seeing if you can stomach the violence.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2015",Insane special effects with NO CGI!!! God bless George Miller and God bless America!,NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2015","I was a big fan of Gareth Evans' Indonesian film ""The Raid"" (as well as its sequel), despite the fact that there was really not much to it. It was an action film in the most basic sense of the word, an exercise in pure, unbridled adrenaline. Now, what would you get if you took that film and refined it a bit, namely by shoring up the characters and the environments?

You'd get ""Mad Max: Fury Road.""

The latest entry in George Miller's Australian apocalyptic saga comes 30 years after the last picture (1985's ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"") and has a new lead actor, but it hasn't missed a beat. Like ""The Raid,"" it's a straight-forward action film with a bare-bones plot, but the character work gives it that extra edge. Miller has populated his movie with a whole roster of quirky, memorable misfits, and though it's true that this is a sequel in a pre-established franchise, the only recurring character is Max himself; it's kind of impressive that, with each new film, the inventive Miller creates a new batch of wacky supporting characters for his stoic lead to interact with.

Taking over for Mel Gibson, Tom Hardy stars as Max Rockatansky, the embattled road warrior who, like John McClane, always seems to find himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. In the desolate, post-apocalyptic Australian wasteland, Max cruises the roads with only one thought on his mind: survival. In Miller's war-ravaged universe, the road gangs have taken over much of the world, and the ultimate prize is gasoline. (This has already been established in prior ""Mad Max"" films, but the beauty of them is that they all function as stand-alone films as well as sequels. You can walk into ""Fury Road"" having seen none of the earlier entries, and you won't have to worry about being lost.)

As with the previous films, Max finds himself in hot water with one of these gangs' warlords. This time, it's the hulking Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who incidentally also played the lead villain, albeit a different one, in the original ""Mad Max"") who runs a dictatorial reign over a city that seems to have been carved from the sides of mountains. Through a series of unusual circumstances, Max ends up on Immortan Joe's bad side when he inadvertently aids the fierce warrior woman Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) in liberating five of Joe's female slaves, his ""breeders."" Joe wants his women back, and all hell is about to break loose on what remains of the Australian highways.

It's a simple story, but it's masterfully executed, and it serves mostly as a clothesline for some sensational action sequences. Whereas ""The Raid"" focused on martial arts, Miller's specialty is the car chase, and like previous Mad Max film ""The Road Warrior,"" he constructs some hum-dingers here. For me to say that is really saying something, because the car chase is one of the most overused clichés in the action genre. If you're going to employ one, you'd better do something unique in order to hold my attention. Miller manages to do so, and with multiple car chases. They're the backbone of the Mad Max franchise and somehow, four movies and 36 years later, he's still finding ways to impress me.

In fact, probably the vast majority of the movie takes place in a moving vehicle. And the film never gets boring. It's a white-knuckled thrill ride throughout. The special effects-mostly practical, as opposed to CGI-are fantastic, but because the characters are offbeat and memorable, we really care about the outcome of these insane car chases.

There's an argument to be made that it's actually Imperator Furiosa who is the main character here, and Max is more of a sidekick. Max has always been a man of few words, and that trend continues here. It's Furiosa who is the more galvanizing of the two, the one who makes the call to action, and she's just as much of a badass as he is (if not more). Evidently this has become a source of concern to some of the more misogynistic movie goers out there, but these people are cretins. The common link in each movie has been Max, but, with the exception of the first movie, he's almost always come across more as support; it's never his plight that the movie is focusing on. Rather, he always finds himself dragged into other people's situations. In this instance, it's Furiosa's.

The only way I would've had a problem with this is if the actress was not up to the task, but Theron makes a more-than convincing action heroine. There's a fierce determination in her eyes and voice, and it's not hard to see why she's both feared and respected in this dystopian universe. Additionally, Tom Hardy makes a splendid Max. Make no mistake, these were big shoes to fill; before Mel was Riggs, he was Max, and it was going to be difficult to find a suitable replacement. Hardy is up to the task; he definitely has the right physicality for the role, but he's also capable of displaying Max's inner turmoil with little more than a grunt and a rueful stare. Max is a wounded person (for reasons I won't reveal here), and though it seems at first glance like an easy role to play, there's a bit more depth than people may realize. I also rather enjoyed the off-the-wall performance of Nicholas Hoult as Nux, a fanatical follower of Immortan Joe. Hoult has established himself as one of the more talented actors of his generation, (""Warm Bodies, ""X-Men: First Class"" and ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"").

I've always been a fan of action films, and it's encouraging that I saw ""Fury Road"" so soon after ""John Wick,"" another recent example of the genre that took a clichéd foundation and did something creative with it. These movies prove that filmmakers don't always have to reinvent the wheel, especially when you can find different things to do with it...like maybe rip somebody's face off.

"Jun 22, 2015","This movie rocks. It's a movie that proves you can have literally non-stop action and still tell a really good story. I thought the story was on point and it never faltered. There was a surprisingly very strong emotional core throughout as well. The movie never feels too long and it's not too short. It's the perfect length.
The acting is very good as well. Tom Hardy does a good job as the lead role, Charlize Theron is fantastic as Furiosa, she has a lot to do and she handles it masterfully. Nicholas Hoult is also very very good. His character has the best arc and I just loved his character. For me he stole every scene he was in.

This gets even worse when the second half of the film turns out to be THE EXACT SAME THING as the first half of the film, just in reverse.

It was gritty but not gory, I wanted both. I also felt like these women wouldn't kick all these guys asses. Is George Miller a feminist now? It sure felt like it. They also didnt wrap up the film with the fate of a main character, did you edit the wrong part out Miller? Tom Hardy was meh, I'll take Mel any day. Charlize was awesome though.

I woke up and got interested again when they finally returned to the citadel. I found Max's character to be utterly uninteresting. I didn't see the original Mad Max movies and so maybe I was missing ""the joke,"" or something, but I just didn't LOVE it like the other folks I saw it with did. Just sayin'!

A follow-up to the Mel Gibson-starring trilogy from the 1980s, 'Fury' enlists the help of George Miller, who directed the original films, as well as Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron as the leads, who play the protagonist Max Rockatansky and rebel warrior Imperator Furiosa, respectively. The film centers around a supply run gone awry, as Furiosa smuggles the five wives of the supreme military leader (Immortan Joe) to rescue and return with them to her homeland. As fate would have it, Max ends up in the middle of everything, and joins forces to escape the clutches of the crazed Joe and his army of War Boys (half-dead beings).

What 'Fury' does particularly well is it keeps the audience engaged. There is not one scene in the film that feels like a wasted opportunity, and while there's wall-to-wall action, there are plenty of more subdued scenes that also work well. The amount of stunt work is probably equal to the CGI, both of which are really impressive, and the cinematography adds another layer of brilliance to the film. In terms of acting, Theron delivers a standout performance, and she really becomes her character in a believable way. Hardy also does well, even with limited dialogue. But in the end, it comes down to the stylized, ""cool"" cinema that fills the screen during 'Fury' that makes it the fun action ride that it is.

While it might not be everyone's cup of tea, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a great soap opera that runs on dust and motor oil, and makes a great case for reviving the franchise for a few more lovely days on the road.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 21, 2015","Terrible reboot of a classic trilogy. The most over hyped, falsely advertised film in history of cinema. You know the world is in trouble when a movie like Fury Road is the best cinema has to offer you these days. Audiences of today could care less for a good story with character development and would rather just sit back and watch two hours of explosions with no real impact behind them. Characters are killed brutally, but we no nothing about them, so why should we care about their demise? Why should we care about this one dimensional character called ""Max"" who is nothing but a generic action hero who takes a back seat, in his own film? Why should we care? Because the explosions are pretty. Pathetic.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 21, 2015","Feministic undertones aside, this movie is a blast.  With kinetic energy to spare and a slew of gloriously constructed action sequences (done with a refreshingly small amount of CGI), Mad Max is the quintessential modern action flick.

"Jun 21, 2015",Looks like a live action version of the game Rage: visually it's fantastic but it's as shallow as they come. Tom Hardy is a great actor but he's not Mad Max. Also the idea that this is a feminist film is utter nonsense given that the majority of the women in the film (i.e. the wives) look and dress like fashion models on a location shoot. If you want a couple of hours of mindless well filmed action scenes masquerading as something more this is the film for you (you might like Rage too). If you want an actual plot with real character development best look elsewhere.,NEUTRAL

"Jun 20, 2015","I can hardly wait to see it again. George Miller has topped himself several times over with this spectacle. $150 million was the budget and it was all put right on the screen in a long procession of action, incredible vehicles, demented characters, and mind boggling stunts and visuals. Anybody who wants to complain that it didn't have much of a plot should stick to books because they are not understanding or appreciating that this is a visual medium and that Miller has upped the ante for how action & adventure flicks should be shot. Tom Hardy makes a great Max and Charlize Theron is every bit his equal as Furiosa, a character I hope we'll see again in future films. Just see it!",NEUTRAL

I spent the first 20 minutes or so wishing I could figure out what was going on, who I was supposed to care about, and wondering if it was going to improve, ever. There were a few places in the middle of the movie when the incredibly gratuitous chase scene paused and something interesting happened (actual dialogue, anyone? please?) Then it was more chasing, more people dying, including a couple I actually had started to finally find interesting, and finally the movie was over. I spent most of the drive home trying to shake myself out of a blue funk, and wishing I could have those 2 hours of my life back.

"Jun 19, 2015","From the beginning until the very end, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" managed to deliver one of the most intense and satisfying movie experiences I've ever had. I can say that it might be the best action movie I've seen. Thanks to the ingenious mind of George Miller, this movie creates an unique atmosphere . And that same atmosphere builds a sheer sense of awe.
Max comes back as the leading man, played by Tom Hardy. He is a man with only one goal, which is to survive. Unfortunately, he gets caught by the warboys, who destroy the Interceptor and take him to a citadel. Returning once again to the Mad Max franchise is Hugh Keays-Byrne, who gives life to Immortan Joe, an uncanny and intimidating ruler who reigns the citadel as a god-like figure. Also, he is the leader of the warboys. Charlize Theron makes an unforgettable role as Imperator Furiosa, who has been sent by Joe on a mission to collect fuel from Gas town. However, she takes a detour for a personal reason. As soon as Joe finds out that she took his wives out of the citadel, he deploys his forces to retrieve his prized possessions. This is when the warboys come in, and we take a peek of a sick warboy, Nux; played by Nicholas Hoult. He wants to join the chase, but he is very weak. So, he takes a blood bag with him, a healthy person, to fill him up. That person happens to be none other than Max himself, who was designated as an universal blood donor.  Just a reminder, this whole sequence was only the setup for the spectacle to come.
Then, Fury Road becomes a visual feast, as one car smashes into another car, people get blown up, a mad guitarist plays a guitar that shoots fire and a huge sandstorm appears... it's epic. Just pure epicness.  If I had to describe this movie in a few words, I'd say that it is a relentless orchestra of pure, beautiful chaos.
Despite a minor shortcoming that I can overlook, this film is very entertaining. With an amazing musical score, realistic stunts and visuals, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is worth watching, and it will remain one of the best.
May this movie ride eternal, shiny and chrome.",NEUTRAL

No minute of the film is put to waste, no detail overlooked, no opportunity missed.  Fury Road is entertainment at its finest constructed in a way that almost forces the viewer to appreciate just how much effort is put into the creation of each individual scene.  Even with shortcomings in character development and backstory that leaves something to be desired, its hard to hate on something that knows exactly what it's trying to do, and does a damn good job carrying it out.",NEUTRAL

Feminism and car explosions don't go together you say?!? Well, apparently they do and to a colossal effect. Charlize Theron is the real hero of this movie, starring as Furiosa, a female soldier in the fanatical army of ""Immortal Joe"" who goes rogue to kidnap Joe's wives/slaves to bring them to freedom. She is pursued for the next 90 minutes with the help of Max (Tom Hardy) an escaped prisoner of Joe's army. While it sounds like it could be tedious, it isn't. The action sequences are punctuated by sincere character development, and this director lets you know that the stakes are real. ANYTHING really can happen to anyone in this movie.

"Jun 14, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road follows Max Rockatansky, played by Tom Hardy, as he is caught up in between a warlord, Immortan Joe, and one of his rogue imperators, Furiosa played by Charlize Theron, who has kidnapped Joe's ""wives"". 

The one thing to know about this film is the non-stop action. This is an action film that takes vehicular mayhem to the extreme while still staying within the confines of reality unlike some other franchises (F&F). The high octane action becomes even more impressive when you realise that Miller had a strong focus on practical effects with claims of 80-90% practical. The action in the film is also framed perfectly for you to enjoy the spectacle without the excessive cutting and shaking that plagues many modern action scenes. 

The story of the film is simple, playing out like one continuous chase akin to a simple video game. Dialogue is also scarce, with Max saying about as much as a movie extra. However although these seem like drawbacks, they allow the film to be unrelenting in the continuous action. Even with the minimal dialogue and plot, the post-apocalyptic world still seems complete due to the excellent design of everything. 

The design of the movie is fantastic. Every detail on the vehicles and the costumes builds a world in which the insane action seems likes it would occur. It is amazing that they actually built many of the vehicles and the subtle plot details within the props. The design actually feels like everything was built from the decaying pieces of the pre apocalyptic world and seems practical for what they do. 

Tom Hardy does a great job of playing Max, displaying a character driven mad by his history and the decaying world around him. Although Max may be our titular character, the most interesting person would definitely be Furiosa, another great performance by Academy Award winner Charlize Theron. Although it is hard to remember any characters name besides the two mentioned, the other characters are still fun to watch and have interesting moments. Even without their names, you will still be like, ""Nicholas Hoult was awesome as whoever he was."" I would have liked to see more of Immortan Joe, because he seemed like a great villain when he was present but I felt like it wasn't enough. 

Some of you may be hesitant to see Fury Road as it is the fourth movie in a franchise from over thirty years ago. However walking in with no knowledge, you will still be able to enjoy the film. Fury Road is interesting as it not a direct sequel to any of the previous films, nor prequel or reboot. Instead it takes the best parts of the character and the world to tell another story that fits within the world but without the necessity of prior knowledge. 
From the opening credits and Hardy's narration, ""My name is Max,"" to the very end, Mad Max: Fury Road is gritty, entertaining, and a never-ending action thrill ride. This film offers more than just the action, it has a female lead that will be remembered like Ripley or Sarah Connor. There are countless memorable sequences throughout and I found it impossible to not enjoy the film. Regardless of how you felt about the previous films (I thought they were okay), this is something definitely worth seeing.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 14, 2015","Mad Max is a colossal achievement in the moviemaking world with its tremendously persistent pace and constant reverence unseen in our millennium. It has the emotions to back up the bombastic action (a balance not usually witnessed in your ordinary summer popcorn flick).

Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are impeccably cast and do an admirable job as the lead characters of this post-apocalyptic remake. Tom Hardy's rendition of Mad, albeit more crazy and unpredictable, was still marvelous in its own right. Charlize Theron's never-before-seen character, Imperator Furiosa, helped enforce much of the emotion that's deliberately felt while still maintaining an aggressively courageous mindset.

All in all, Mad Max satisfies in pretty much every department. Masterclass in its execution, Mad Max will be stored in my personal list of favorite films of all time.",NEUTRAL

The colours are there, but they're multiple shades of the desert sand mixed with plumes of smoke. The grandeur is there, but it consists of vast expanses of deserts and testosterone-driven action sequences!

The performances are definitely worth mentioning as well. Tom Hardy as the eponymous character is solid as ever, and Charlize Theron is breathtakingly beautiful despite the war paint. But the scene-stealers were Hugh Keays-Byrne as the ominous Immortal Joe and the supremely-talented Nicholas Hoult as the crazed Nux.

Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior gives the character depth - through tiny glimpses of humanity in his sharing of his food with the dog and his relationship with the Gyro Captain.

"Jun 13, 2015","I finally got to see this movie. Being the feminist, movie lover that I am, everyone wanted me to see it. The look of shock on people's faces when I say no I haven't seen it yet was pretty amusing. By the time I wanted to see it everyone had already gone. Then it was a matter of finding a theater that still played it and being in the area to watch it. Either way it was worth seeing it on the big screen. 

First, let me say the action was superb. Michael Bay at his best could not even touch the symphony of explosions, fist fights, shoot outs, and cars ramming each other that Miller created.  Kudos to all the graphic artists, set and costume designers that made it possible. 

Second, casting was great. In fact it is what attracted me to this movie in the first place. I admit that Tom Hardy has been my eye candy, but he is a great actor as well. Choosing him for Max was a great fit. Charlize Theron as Furiosa was the best fit of all. I honestly don't see anyone else in that role. Nicholas Hoult was also a very nice surprise. Just when I think he is going to be erased from the movie at the start, he rises to the occasion and becomes a strong part of it. Even the actresses that were the wives were wonderful, drawing attention to each ones dominate traits and not being a typical group of pretty women that need to be rescued. 

So this movie has been labeled as a feminist movie. I agree with the label. It is far better than many action flicks that have women in the background or are the reason why the protagonist is fighting. Some people have gone as far to call it a Furiosa movie. Well no, I wouldn't go that far. Furiosa was a driving power, but it was more like a partnership between genders to accomplish the goal. Not even the wives were weak and helpless. My breath caught when a pregnant woman stood in front of Max to protect him, while making eye contact with her enemy. They actively took part in their escape and survival. Max and Furiosa in a dance of spraying bullets and car chasing was a beautiful experience. Miller gave each character equal credit in the movie. Max didn't have many lines, yes, but someone who has been alone, then taken prisoner to be used for his blood and feels responsible for the death of many people would have a social impairment. He was a similar character in Lawless, but a little more, well mad. The expressions and non-verbals he did got his point across well anyway. The tribe of older women was also nice to see. These desert amazons were tough and kicked the shit out of an army full of crazed men. Just both genders equally beating each other with no hesitation. I want to see more of this. This one is high on my feminist meter up there with Edge of Tomorrow and Alien. 

Thank you Mr. Miller for a movie that gave me hope for gender equality in film.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 13, 2015","Meh! Action, Stop, Action, Stop, Action, Stop.  No back story or any real character development, character interaction.   I didn't care if any of them lived or died.

I would have liked to see more detail of this world and its cities.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 13, 2015","With so many positive reviews, I thought I'd check it out. Was very disappointed. It's way too long, for a story that's barely there. I couldn't help but check my phone multiple times throughout, to check the time. The action sequences were visually impressive, but with so little plot, you couldn't really feel the stakes. I take it back actually. There is no story only action sequences. Let's put it this way, if you loved Pacific Rim, you'll love this too probably, though even Pacific Rim had a more developed and interesting story. There are definitely worse movies out there, but the hype far outweighs Fury Road's execution/substance. 

Think of a typical Michael Bay movie, but without the characters and plot.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 12, 2015","One for the action junkies.  So in the post-apocalyptic future where fuel is used as currency, Max (Tom Hardy) is forced into an alliance with Furiosa (Charlize Theron).  They attempt to outrun multiple factions of bad guys, all of which are pursuing them for a plethora of different reasons.  I don't want to call this overhyped, I really don't, but I don't know what other word to use for it.  When a film is sitting on a 98% at rottentomatoes, and is currently considered to be the 38th best film of all time (according to the unbiased voters on IMDb), it's either just me, or people are in cahoots.  This is really giving me Interstellar flashbacks, because while I do recognize elements that work in both films, I failed to connect on that level of full blown adoration that almost everybody else has for the film.  If you love action and that is the only thing that you ask for out of your action movies, by all means, this is your ticket, and I would like to start this off with all of the positives about Mad Max: Fury Road.  The action is extremely well choreographed and filmed, and is shot in such a way that you never have any doubt exactly what is going on; it's not like a Transformers movie where it's just a bunch of metal clashing together, you feel every single hit and crash.  The majority of the stunts and effects were done practically, which makes it all the more impressive.  All of the designs are cool, from the disturbing mutilated characters to the vehicles that have been cobbled together from spare parts.  There are so many bizarre touches and so much attention to detail, it goes a long way to building this post-apocalyptic world.  All of the effort was made, which makes it all the more disappointing that I only liked it, and didn't fall madly in love with it.  The action is all great, but where Mad Max: Fury Road comes up short is... well, pretty much everywhere else.  You are thrust into the thick of the action so quickly, and it wastes no time on stuff like character development.  You know what helps an action sequence?  Caring about whether your protagonist survives or not.  I wanted to care, but this film has other interests set as priorities.  The writing doesn't sparkle, and I can't think of a single quote off the top of my head when I just watched this three days prior.  The pacing on this is unorthodox, having two extensive car chases at the beginning and the end, and having all of the slim plot crammed into the middle.  Also, there's all this hullabaloo going around about how feminist this is, when I really think people have that confused with it just featuring a capable female protagonist; don't get me wrong, it's still a good thing, but there's really nothing about this that screams ""feminism"".  I feel that I appreciated this more than I actually ended up liking it, and I think I've reached an age where this brand of insanity doesn't appeal to me the way that it potentially could have, had I been a decade younger.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 12, 2015","Australian-born director/writer George Miller has had one interesting career. Not only is he responsible for the cult 1980's action series featuring his vengeance -driven cop Max Rockatansky but he has four Oscar nods under his belt for such unlikely fare as the family film Babe (Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay), his Susan Sarandon medical drama Lorenzo's Oil (Best Original Screenplay) and the animated penguin musical Happy Feet (the 2006 Oscar-winner for Best Animated Feature). He also directed one of my favorite guilty pleasures, 1987's The Witches of Eastwick. 

Now he returns to the series that made him famous but this time with all the technical power of CGI behind him. He uses it to dazzling effect. This is the biggest, baddest, maddest Max ever. Almost the entire two hours is non-stop road warrior action. Max is ""rescued"" from being a universal blood donor to one of the vile Immortan Joe's henchmen by the divine Charlize Theron. More like he holds her hostage for a ride out of the desert. And rightly so as her flight away from the desolate capitol is what nearly gets him killed in the first place. She is fleeing with a gaggle of Joe's hostage brides, and Joe launches his full army of high-octane vehicles after her. Every action sequence that follows is a heavy metal barrage capable of shaking a theater to the ground. A great deal of the impossible-looking stunt work is apparently real, and Miller claims to use CGI only when necessary. Like when he throws some fire tornados into the mix.

 Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises; Inception) is your typical action cypher - almost silent, pained, enigmatic. We don't know him at all. I venture to say he's the weak link in an otherwise exemplary effort. But Theron totally owns as Imperator Furiosa - a femme fatale with a bionic arm and a relentless drive to rid herself of the male-dominated apocalypse. 

Is this a feminist manifesto as some detractors have claim (those detractors by the way are commonly called male chauvinist pigs)? You bet it is. ""One man, one bullet"" is a just a sampling of the dogma spouted by the few free women still struggling to survive in the desert. That's what comes of a society where sexual slavery and human dairy farms are the norm. 

Miller coaxed veteran Oscar-winning cinematographer John Seale (The English Patient; Cold Mountain; The Talented Mr. Ripley) out of retirement to do this film, and for that, cinema lovers should be rejoicing.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 12, 2015","Its interesting to see a re-imagining of a cult classic, where you instantly know this take on the series will become a cult classic of its own.

We need more movies to be as bold and risky as THAT in today's world. Fury Road brings a grit back to cinema that's been missing probably since the last Mad Max movie. Which was 3 decades ago, by the way. I don't have enough words to describe my satisfaction with Fury Road, but I will say it's a work of art and I hope it goes down in history as such. I am inspired and grateful to be able to say that I saw possibly the best Mad Max film on the big screen.

JunkieXL also provides a massive and sweeping score that brings only amplifies the action more so, most notably in the motorcycle ambush scene.

Seeing how strongly it scored here at Rotten Tomatoes, I figured ""How bad could it be?"" 

Well, for the two hours or so, I pretty much came away thinking what I spent my time watching was just a prolonged car chase followed by another. When the stupid guy jamming on the guitar for seemingly the whole movie was thrown from his vehicle toward the end, I was so tempted to bounce out of my chair and let out a big cheer. While Charlize Theron was solid, as was Tom Hardy, the lack of any real plot to speak of was the death of this movie.

The film is basically an epic chase that doesn't let up until the very end. Action packed with a thumping soundtrack and visuals to amaze.

"Jun 9, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is justly regarded by many as the best action film of the decade so far. Spectacularly gripping from start to finish, the film showers its viewers with moments of awe and insanity, with the ability to bring them back down to earth with emotional and harshly realistic aspects. Whilst Tom Hardy is faultless in his Bane-like performance, Charlize Theron and her band of freedom fighters steal the show. George Miller thoroughly demonstrates his skill as a director, providing a magical yet scarily realistic portrayal of his imagined dystopian future. With the use of stunning practical effects, gripping action sequences, and strong character development, Miller is able to bring his fantasy to screens in an awesome and beautiful way.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 9, 2015","For a movie packed to the brim with spectacular mayhem and extravagant violence, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is, ironically, a study in minimalism. George Miller takes a few short minutes to paint a vivid picture of a sadistic dictator betrayed by a noble subject, and then he lets all hell - seriously, every ounce of it - break loose.

There is effectively no character development, no context, and so little dialogue that the movie would have been just fine without it. Instead, Miller daringly and successfully replaces those traditional elements with relentlessly bonkers action, brought to life with practical effects and an endless nightmare of visual creativity. For good measure and scale, the intensely personal action is framed with gorgeous wide angle shots of dessert wasteland. 

One could imagine that it would be exhausting to live inside the creative minds of artists like Terry Gilliam, David Lynch, or Rob Zombie. George Miller, who has been better known for his children's fare in recent years, apparently belongs right next to those wonderful lunatics.

Even though it's the fourth installment of a consistently excellent series, Miller has delivered something wholly original. There's a new bar set, and Miller himself might be the only filmmaker working today who has the ability to raise it.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 9, 2015","A tour de force from beginning to end, George Miller's foray back into this desolate world grabs hold tight and never lets go. The scope and intensity of the action scenes were breathtaking and never felt repetitive or overdone. I tip my hat to the production crew on this film, it's simply visually spectacular and the sets, wardrobe, vehicles, makeup, and technical and special effects were all first rate, especially the makeup and wardrobe. The music was on point too, Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL) has really come into his own since I heard Bombers Over Ibiza from The Dark Knight Rises. Tracks like Brothers In Arms were relentlessly powerful and tribal while softer tracks like Many Mothers provide warmth and comfort in this bleak world. Excellent performances all around, Thomas Hoult provided the right amount of comic relief and heart to the group. I thought Tom Hardy was superb and his portrayal of Mad Max was complex, rich, and left me wanting to see more of him, and last, but certainly not least, Charlize Theron, who knocked it out of the park. I always love seeing more badass women in cinema and Theron nailed that balance of being emotionally tender but also ferocious and tough as hell. I was also pleasantly surprised that (to me anyway) the movie seemed like it focused more on her and her story of redemption while still leaving the door open for us to learn more about Max in future stories. Highly recommend this film. :)",NEUTRAL

"Jun 7, 2015","Me pareció una muy buena película de acción, escenas muy interesantes y un rítmo digno de la mad max 2 que recuerdo, hay varios encuadres y uso del color particulares que son geniales (no extrañe tanto la estética ochentosa que me gustaba de las viejas), muy buenos diseños de personajes y autos, sin embargo pese a ser una peli donde la velocidad en las escenas de autos es un factor relevante, me costó ver los cambios en la misma (ese convoy de guerra era un bólido), de hecho muchos momentos donde se bajaban las revoluciones no dejaban de parecer lo mismo, el nitro (aspecto de culto en la peli), no tiene mucho impacto visual (en particular extrañé como era tratado antes visualmente, que me fascinaba y lo encontraba como una marca de la serie). 

Amplia con unos cuantos conceptos muy buenos el contexto de la serie (que en general era algo en lo que se concentraba poco y nada), el tema de los recursos y la mitología hacia los automóviles (me gustó el nitro en la boca para desquiciarse, un completo placebo), quizá lo de la mitología nórdica me resultara innecesario, me hubiese gustado más que se desprendieran completamente de lo conocido.

Me resultó deshonesta con la trama general de la serie (algo que la 2 también mandó a volar sin importarle nada), principalmente porque sigue marcando una brecha muy grande entre el entorno de la 1 con respecto a lo que sucede en el contexto, son casi historias independientes y pienso que los guiños que realiza hacia el pasado son demasiado vagos, por eso es como que se siente la necesidad de otra instancia de la película (capaz que es un plan del director, pero es como empezar una película por el medio).

Obviamente no era una película sobre Max, Furiosa es un personaje mucho más trabajado y la real protagonista de esta historia (que me pareció bastante bien), pero me faltó desarrollo en Joe y Max, me parece que fueron trabajados muy superficialmente, en especial el último, será también porque Hardy pese a que hace cosas bien, es un tipo ya muy encasillado en su tipo de rol, además que me parece que siempre le falta algo en sus actuaciones (me resulta como si no le pusiese ganas a lo que hace).

"Jun 7, 2015","I've never seen the other Mad Max movies, but after seeing this one I really want to.  Fury Road is ridiculously entertaining, and the most fun I've had at the movies since the first Avengers.  I had a huge smile on my face for the majority of the movie, reveling in the destruction on screen.  The plot is extremely simple (basically just an escort mission) but it accomplishes what it needs to: it makes us invested enough in the characters goal to add tension to the action sequences and make us emotionally invested in their success.  In the course of the two hour runtime, about 90 minutes of the film is an action sequence.  Miraculously, it never gets tiring (take note Michael Bay) and is consistently entertaining.  The film constantly finds new ways to entertain the hell out of you with stellar stunts and massive destruction which are mostly used with practical effects.  My one gripe with the film is that the ending comes a little too abruptly and feels a bit too clean, but everything leading up to that is so damn awesome I really can't be upset.

"Jun 7, 2015","Worst. Movie. EVER. So cheesy, I think I'm now lactose intolerant. 
I have no idea how this movie is getting such high ratings, because those people obviously did not watch the same drivel we watched.  The only thing that could possibly redeem this movie would be to cast Melissa McCarthy and Adam Sandler in the lead, and pass it off as a spoof.

"Jun 7, 2015",The action in this movie was incredible. But to me that was about it.  Way too much crazy and over the top.  Also Max did not feel at all like he was the star.

I'm glad I did since this is the best movie I've seen in ages and left me restless, shaking and amazed. I want more male action heroes like Tom Hardy's Max: even through his trauma and torture that robs him of his speech through most of the movie, his humanity survives. I want, no, I need more female action heroes like Charlize's Furiosa: fierce, angry but with a good, caring heart who gets the job done. More action movies done with such thoughtfulness, with such heart tangled with all the Tarantino-esque bright colours and general craziness. And, you know, the guitar guy. That goddamn guitar guy.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 7, 2015","This movie delivers on exactly what it advertises. Car chases, Mad Max and lots of violence. Don't go into this expecting a lot of depth but honestly that not why you go see Mad Max, its for the visuals and man are there a lot of great ones. This movie slightly suffers from too much green screen but the car chases are legit exciting having been enhanced instead of fully computer rendered. Max has barely any lines and the majority of the dialog is done by Furiosa and Nux but to be honest their characters end up being more interesting. Max is in his element just doing his normal survival thing but Furiosa is obviously in the midst of deep emotional conflict and so is Nux as he goes from bad to good.

Maybe I am just exhausted by the prevalence of exceptionally prolonged fight or action scenes in movies today. Then add in that directors think so little of their audience that they either don't realize of don't care that people are taking physical abuse that would kill anyone and they just shake it off and keep fighting as if nothing happened. Add to this the frenetic pacing, the pandering to young teens with the insertion of hot women (the only five hot women on earth apparently, who are all also vapid) and a manic guitar shredder and I was ""Out"".

"Jun 4, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road

To quote Joe Bob Briggs, the world's most famous drive-in movie critic, ""There's no plot to get in the way of the story.""

Mad Max: Fury Road (MMFR) is set in a dystopian future where warlords rule and fight over oil and water in a desolate, desert land outside any rule of law. That would NEVER happen. 

It's the stupidest movie I have enjoyed in a long time. The sets aren't wonderful. And the acting...what acting? The editing? Meh. The cinematography is okay, not spectacular for a dystopian road movie. The make up? Nope, not great. 

What works in the film is the action and morality tale. And the vehicles, the vehicles are COOL! (i.e. fascinating) I'm not a gearhead by any stretch, but what they did to mix different vehicles together to make scary road war machines was very successful. 

Like the horrendous (there are no words to describe how bad) Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome (1985), MMFR is a morality tale not about saving Max but about saving the innocent. However, the writers were smart this time, giving Max few lines and making the female protagonist, Imperator Furiosa, the star. 

If there was an Oscar category for best stunt work, MMFR would win hands down. It's fun to watch while incredibly improbable. However, because it is set in its own world, we accept that. Furthermore, there are no posturing heroes spouting diatribes from patriotic speeches (Avengers) or camp and cute but deadly, sorts of heroes (Guardians of the Galaxy) or a vomit inducing good versus evil dualism that pervade so many super hero and other action films. While violent and full of explosions, it doesn't insult us with such morality play nonsense. MMFR is pure action; take it for leave it. ??Rating: Matinee/Full Price

If action without pretense is your cup of tea, if you are sick of the simplistic good versus evil plots, if you like characters that don't easily fit into a box called 'villain' or 'hero', than you will enjoy MMFR. If you need those things or you want more plot or thought, I understand. I would recommend you stay home and watch the also entertaining ""Theory of Everything.""  But you'll miss some bad ass vehicles...

"Jun 4, 2015","George Miller is the enemy of exposition. He does not waste time ""telling"" the audience what they just saw, he ""shows"" us with the most deft hand and skill imaginable! Since seeing Road Warrior when it first came out I knew this man was one of the best director visionaries alive and so far ahead of his time. During RW my jaw hit the floor and I sat in my chair in stunned silence long after it ended. The usher had to kick me out. Instead of driving home like a happy zombie, I bought a 2nd ticket and went along for the same ride with equal enthusiasm, awe and respect. Then King Miller went on to change gears with Babe and Happy Feet -- talk about diversity and talent! Babe had more heart and emotion than any cheesy romance I had ever seen and deserved to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture! Why people objected to that honor is beyond me. 

What followed after the less than stellar Thunderdome (can't win them all) was 30 years of copycat action movies that could never match the standard that George Miller set forth. It's almost as if GM came back to Max's world to tell them all - ""No, no, no! That's not how you make an action movie! Have I taught you nothing with my work?"" - then proceeded to ""show"" them once again how it should be done with FR. I'm guessing that the bar has been raised so high into the clouds that every movie studio (except Warner) is freaking out by the lesson Mr. Miller just taught them all. 

Fast forward to Fury Road, a crowning epic that defies logic and words to describe. This movie could have worked without any dialogue; the minimal words spoken were precious gems treated with great respect, without loud blaring organ music drowning it out (I'm yelling at you Interstellar!). There was plenty of dialogue and explanation, with the visuals providing all that the viewer needed to follow this profound and relevant story. Sure there is lots of CG, but it is woven in so organically that you don't even notice -- the flow between live stunts and post enhancement is seamless and elegant. This is unlike the Avengers that makes me sick with claustrophobic CG, and so many other movies that can't sell a story without blasting you with snazzy technology. 

I've seen FR 3 times and am writing my first review for a movie. George Miller should win every award in the book and I expect it to be nominated for every Oscar category, expect perhaps screenplay -- bully to that! If you spend the time following George Miller's brilliant career, hearing his interviews and understanding the passion and fortitude it took to make this astounding movie, then you would come to appreciate what happens when you authentically combine love and art. 

And let's not forget to thank Warner Bros for having the faith and pocketbook to finance this triumph. They had as much trust in Mr. Miller's skill and vision as his loyal fans. I've never seen the Fast and Furious movies and can't imagine how I would react to stunts that would seem like kids games compared to the masterful choreography in Fury Road. And how is it that no one was killed or badly injured on the set? That is testament to the great care that GM and his team put into all the pre-production, storyboarding, and precision execution. The story of the making of Fury Road would be as inspiring and entertaining as the final product!",NEUTRAL

"Jun 4, 2015",Somehow surpassed my already high expectations!,NEUTRAL
"Jun 4, 2015","This movie delivers on what long time Mad Max fans craved, Pure chaotic fun with bad ass cars, gritty action and no punches pulled.

This movie has and will continue to receive criticism for the simple plot, but for this this movie is it works and any attempt to shoe horn in a deep complicated plot would get lost in the anarchy that spins your head around for the near whole duration on of the movie. The use of practical effects and stunt actors is refreshing in a world where cgi is a hallmark of Hollywood, George Miller invested an immense amount of detail into the Mad Max world presented in Fury Road that helps immerse you this world and makes the seemingly unbelievable post apocalyptic universe feel very tangible to the point you might try and shake the sand out of your shoes after leaving the theater.

While this movie is a triumph in a landscape littered with remakes and cookie cutter films that seem tired and regurgitated this movie is not without its flaws. The most glaring to me is the lack of moments where Max really shined, his dialogue was short, with very little memorable lines, which is a shame because tom hardy is extremely talented. That being said, this does not take a way from the movie as a whole, it fits the story and works well. It's only after processing the movie as a whole you might step back and think, ""there wasn't a lot of Max in that Mad Max film.""

In closing this a sold film, but its not something you are going to finish and feel emotionally moved. You will leave the film feeling like you went on a roller coaster throw a wasteland, its what a summer movie should be, and what action movies arent anymore FUN.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 4, 2015",Without a doubt maybe the best action movie since raiders of the lost ark. Right out the gate it grabs you and until the last scene it won't let go. What I liked about this movie is you don't have to be familiar with the mad max series to enjoy it. Hardy is perfect and so is Theron. There are some disturbing scenes regarding how they get some particular nutrients and I'll leave it at that. But one of the best pure action films ever,NEUTRAL
"Jun 4, 2015",Noise and blood. Lots of ugly setting and ugly looking people.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 4, 2015","This is probably the best action movie I've seen in the past 10 years. 

  Sure there have been many that have come out, but when I actually dig deep into them and think about them more and what they were, their significance goes down.

  This is as pure action film as it gets that starts from the beginning, has minor breaks in the action to ""evolve"" the story a tad, and continue moving full steam.
  It's relentless and hits you hard with it's thumping soundtrack that truly moves this film at a high pace. 

  Matt Hardy is badass as Max despite being secondary and having very few words in the flim. Although the film doesn't need too much talking as the action does all the talking.
  Charlize Theron without a doubt is the driving force in the movie and she is the main player here with Max looking in. She shows a very strong, determination that cannot be broken. You can see it in her face and actions. She rocked this movie.

  This is a movie you can watch over and over whenever you need to wake up, and forget about any of the past Mad Max movies and watch this as a new one. Try to leave the comparisons at home. It's not like a new guy took over the previous guys work here, it's still the same George Miller putting together his finest work.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 4, 2015","All flash and no substance.  Even the titular character was completely one dimensional and in fact took a total back seat to Furiosa and Nux.  No explanations for Max's flashbacks.  No explanation for Furiosa's arm.  Nor for either of their supposed quests for redemption.  The only actually interesting character was Nux, who actually went through a transformation over the course of the film.  Even the major plot twist was something I wound up anticipating from about halfway through the movie.

I really don't get what has all the critics raving about this flick.  It is absolutely mindless eye candy that throws away all substance in favor of goofy visuals.  In other words... it's exactly what critics have been railing against for the last 20 years.  The movie is a decent popcorn flick for killing a couple of hours.  Just don't expect to ever be actually interested in anything that's going on.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 4, 2015","If there is such a term as ""half-mainstream midnight movie"", it will be best coined to ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". From it's narrative approach, to various references and symbols, the film oozes midnight cinema from every pore. 
Having said this, it is a surprise to me that it is so highly rated(both on imdb and rt).

As for the film itself, it is a visual delight, has enough action to keep viewers on their sit, but it also has an uneven(if a bit lazy) opening act and a rather vague story.

"Jun 3, 2015","What's good about it?  Well, the visuals are great, and the 3D is very well done.

What's bad about it?  Oh boy...

Mad Max 2 set the scene.  It wasn't a complex plot, but it worked well.  Mad Max 3 added some more nice visuals, a bit of a mess of a plot, but still OK.  Then there was Waterworld, which took a lot of the visuals but with an even thinner plot, and rightly got panned as a derivative piece of junk.

This one?  It's Waterworld minus whatever plot and character still survived.  I wish I could think of something which would redeem it, but really there's nothing.  All that's left is to look at the pretty pictures, and by halfway through you've seen whatever there is to see.

George Miller definitely has form on this.  The original ""300"" was groundbreaking; the sequel was tat.  The original ""Sin City"" was groundbreaking; the sequel was tat.  In this one, I guess he's thought that since it's a sequel then he can go straight to tat without passing good.",NEUTRAL

I resisted seeing it in 3D because it doesn't seem like the type of film that would benefit from that treatment, but I was very wrong. Sometimes the film has so much going on it it you're not sure where to look - sometimes it doesn't matter because anywhere you look something amazing is happening - but 3D focuses the action to the focal point of the frame. It brings out details that might have been missed before.

It's like a room full of pinatas all exploding at the same time but you miss the big one filled with the best candy because you weren't looking where you were supposed to be looking, and consequently you're stuck with Tootsie Rolls and single Starbursts from the cheapo family. Not in 3D you don't, you're looking right where the director intended you to look at precisely the right moment. Boom.

"Jun 3, 2015","It has been nearly 2 weeks since I saw Fury Road, and I'm still trying to recover. It is the sort of film you forget to breathe through, much like Interstellar, but for an altogether different reason. Unrelenting from beginning to end, this post-apocalyptic saga is virtually one, long, explosive chase sequence, albeit one which seemingly has new ideas on tap. The action (i.e. the whole film) is utterly bonkers, conceptually and in execution. That writer-director George Miller and his team concocted such ferocious set pieces is impressive enough, but being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work - augmented by gritty CGI - is simply awe-inspiring.
Visually it is vivid and spectacular; the searing desert landscape offering a dirt-filled grime so tangible your throat will dry up within seconds, whilst the vehicles are creative and wonderfully preposterous. The heart-pounding score by Junkie XL, in which he blends orchestral and heavy metal music, accompanies Miller's on screen splendour to create a visceral experience for both the eyes and the ears. The vehicular carnage may be the drawcard, but the committed cast elevate the overall product. Tom Hardy is savage as Max, Charlize Theron is compelling as Imperator Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult (Remember, X-Men???) is gonzo as Nux, whilst a plethora of recognisable Aussies show up in deranged cameos.
There's an intensity here you just don't find in majority of the big-budgeted blockbusters; an inventiveness in all elements that drives this movie from great to mesmerizing. Miller hasn't played in the Mad Max world since the dreadful Beyond Thunderdome back in 1985, but by God he has redeemed himself, and then some. Fury Road is a rollicking ride that carves out a piece of cinematic history all for itself.
Considering the wave of terrible 90's Sci-fi sequels/remakes we've had fired our way in the past few years (Terminator Salvation, RoboCop, Total Recall etc.) Fury Road's success has been more than a pleasant surprise.
In short it is a grungy masterpiece.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 2, 2015","Take a heavy metal concert and mix it with probably one of the best action films of all time. This was easily the most exciting and ferocious Mad Max film to date. There is a small story amongst this high octane tale and since the first installment, this one actually made sense among all the sequels which were a bit harder to follow, even if we don't know the whole backstory of how this world came to be in this apocalyptic setting. Here we have these characters all fighting for survival and more importantly here, women fighting to get their independence back in a chaotic world ruled by a psychopath. My only complaint really here is that the acting and script here are a bit dry, but that doesn't take away from this amazing picture that is really unlike anything. I've ever seen. Charlize Theron is also pretty much boss here taking over what seems to be the lead role in this picture and kicks some major ass here. Tom Hardy was a  decent Max, even though his acting was a bit off here. Also, Nicholas Hoult was fantastic as the albino looking character in this and is quite memorable. This is easily the craziest action ride you are likely to go on this whole year and the academy awards owes this film as much technical awards as it can get along with it's heavy hitting soundtrack. Easily one of the best films of the year and officially in my top action films of all time",NEUTRAL

If it were called 'Fury Road' with no mention of Max, and Tom Hardy were removed from the film entirely, it would be a decent action flick.  What has happened is that the Mad Max character and franchise have been hijacked in order to sell tickets.  The dialogue is barely audible, drowned out by engine noise and background music, and exactly ONE line (about 20 minutes in) got a subtitle.  The whole thing needs subtitles!  In the REAL Mad Max movies, you know you're watching a movie about Mad Max - in this one, he's an afterthought, in front of the camera much of the time but not even close to being central to the story.  Was there a time when Tom Hardy took over, made a decision, became a leader, did something heroic?  If so, I must have been so bored by the time it happened that I missed it.  And what was up with that absurd Russ Meyer-style naked-girls-in-the-desert interlude?

"Jun 1, 2015","Double Cadillacs, Blood Banks and a flame throwing guitar, Miller's latest masterpiece; Fury Road, is high octane and not for the weak hearted. As is typical with Miller's franchise, the film throws you at the deep end, straight into a dusty oblivion; polluted and dry. As with the rest of Mad Max, it's best to sit back and let Miller display his vision to you, while the story is both fantastic and crucial, the concept is what we're here for; the cars, the stunts, the rut that humanity has got itself in. Without going into the plot; Miller has created a ground breaking film that in it's heart represents the objectification of both women and men, it challenges Hollywood's perception of women's role, demonstrating that women can be leads without romantic subplots, sexualisation or adopting masculine qualities to succeed. It demonstrates the mind set of dictatorships and it's disregard of seeing every day men as human beings - but instead cogs in a machine. Immortan Joe himself brain washes his war boys into thinking dying in war is the most noble thing a man can do. To put it simply: Miller has made a film that shows us what man and woman can achieve if we work together. Theron and Hardy are both excellent, Theron taking the main stage and executing Furiosa beautifully - a woman who clearly shares Miller's vision. To conclude: Exciting, beautifully shot and as usual amazing, real life stunts; Fury Road is bound to get your heart pumping high octane crazy blood.",NEUTRAL

"May 31, 2015",George Miller's long-dormant franchise is dusted off and given a new coat of paint in this explosive and dynamic revival.

He eventually falls in with an idealistic warrior (Charlize Theron) who's dedicated to escorting a chieften's rape slaves to freedom.

"May 31, 2015","I cannot explain the 98% this film is getting in Rottentomatoes. Based on that, I expected more - or at least something mildly original. But this incarnation of Mad Max is no better than Road Warrior or Thunderdome. If anything, it lacks the political intrigue and motivation of those films. This is basically just a long chase scene. And even those aren't anything original. It looks cool and the pace is frenetic, but we've seen that in the previous two (the original Mad Max is the oddball in the group). Furthermore, there is so much about the Max universe that makes no sense (gasoline is at a premium and yet these idiots drive like madmen for fun with flaming guitars?!) and this version does nothing to erase those gaps in logic. If anything, this one adds more post-apocalyptic silliness - but I don't want to spoil anything. Tom Hardy makes for a far less compelling Max than Gibson. Theron is fine, but I've never been much of a fan. If anything, this is Nicholas Hoult's film. I have been avoiding much of the press surrounding this film, but what I've gathered is that the film is drawing a lot of attention for the strong female characters, which may have been contributing to the high RT percentage. But I think that says more about the sad state of female roles in cinema rather than the quality of this movie. Save yourself the money unless you are a fan of the genre or, perhaps, if you have never seen the Gibson Max and can see this with fresh eyes.",NEUTRAL

"May 31, 2015","Three weeks ago, the world of Max Rockantansky was somewhat a mystery to me. I'd seen bits and pieces of The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunder Dome on TV over the past few years, then the trailer for Mad Max: Fury Road came screeching into theaters. It was without a doubt the most intriguing trailer I have seen in the past five years. I soon set out obtaining the first three movies and speeding through them in preparation for Fury Road. From the semi-dystopian Australia, in Mad Max to the putrid squalled of Barter town in Beyond Thunder dome, Director George Miller depicts mankind's fall, dissention into madness and struggle to recapture what was lost, with his middle instalment The Road Warrior as his most fully realized vison. That is until now. 
	Mad Max: Fury Road finds our Anti-hero now played with a silent strength and yes, intense madness by Tom Hardy, struggling with visons of his slain daughter. Miller wastes no time moving us into the action with an intricate set piece and violent explosions usually saved for the finally of top tier action movies. Captured and muzzled by Imortain Joe and his brainwashed War Boys, Max finds himself being used as a medical supply for the first third of the movie. Miller uses the opportunity to introduce us to his bizarre patriarchy led by Imortain Joe, where woman are both objects and providers of sustenance. Joe has created a cult fueled by suicidal warriors who want nothing more but to die proudly for him in battle and be carried to the gates of Valhalla for their eternal reward. The most interesting part about the early picture, is that Miller explains nothing. We are introduced into the world at lighting speed and operating on inferences, which leads to quite the exhilarating experience. 
	Max is saved by opportunity when a female War rig driver named Furiosa, played with great strength and pain by Charlize Theron, frees Joe's enslaved wives and high tails it to her matriarchal home land. The rest of the film is essentially one of the most exciting car chases ever put on film, chalked full of eye popping practical effects, only letting up for the audience to clear the ""guzzoline"" from their nostrils. With all this excitement, Fury Road doesn't run out of things to say either. Present is strong commentary on everything from female empowerment to cult practices. The real victory for Miller is that all these elements meld organically into a fully realized world. Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the most intense and well-crafted action films in years, the fact that you leave with something to think about is just gas in the tank.",NEUTRAL

"May 31, 2015","This is a review two IMAX viewings in the making, and not because it was incomprehensible, but because of all the badassery that I didn't quite catch the first time. If you don't want to read this inevitably wordy review, then I'll just say this: Go watch the movie in the biggest, loudest way possible.

So if you haven't seen the previous Mad Max movies (I recommend The Road Warrior) they're violent and gritty tales told in the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Australia, the highlight usually being the the crazy bad guys. At the lead of these stories is Max Rockatansky (previously played by Mel Gibson, now played by Tom Hardy), who used to be a cop of sorts but now he belongs to the mad. As far as characters go, he's actually not the most interesting one. This is kind of a tradition for Max. With the exception of the first movie, Max is usually just caught in the middle of someone else's ongoing problems, with his only motivations being getting stuff for his long and lonely road ahead. This movie kind of keeps the tradition going, but it doesn't at the same time. Since the last movie, Max has actually succumbed to his craziness, and become more of a wild animal than a straight thinking person. 

Through fortuitous events, he soon unites with Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron) who, let me tell you, is the REAL badass of this movie. Seriously, this is the best I've seen Charlize Theron, you just totally buy her awesomness. And it's not just that she's a total badass, but the central story revolves around her. This movie may as well have been called ""Furiosa Road"". And the interesting characters don't stop their! There's also Nux (played by Nicholas Hoult) who belongs to the group of crazies trying to chase down Max and Furiosa. I knew for a while that Hoult was a cool guy to watch on-screen, but his role as Nux totally flips what you ever thought about him. He's just batshit, as in his motivations don't really make sense but it's those motivations that drive him as a character, and this is the first time you see this from the crazies perspective in a Mad Max movie. The bad guy, Immortan Joe (who played Toecutter in the first movie!), is also one of the sickest bad guys in movie history. He has a kickass breathing mask and just an overall intimidating presence about him that would just make you shit your pants if you met him in real life.

But enough of all this character nonsense, let's get to the real star of the movie: THE FUCKING ACTION!!! Well, firstly, there's a surprising amount of story and it actually carries a lot of heart and emotion, but I don't wanna bore you with that. This movie is a spectacle of eye candy and explosions. Almost everything you see exploding, flipping and crashing is made with practical effects, meaning no CGI unless the moment REALLY calls for it. And it's all just so relentless and an assault on your senses in the best possible way. And it's all shown in b-e-a-UTIFUL wide shots with a kickass soundtrack to get you pumped for the rest of the ride.

To summarize, George Miller brought Mad Max back to the big screen with a vengeance. While Max isn't the quite the main character in his own movie, him and everyone else are awesome to watch (an honorable mention for the Doof Warrior), there was a surprisingly good story, and the incredible set pieces make Mad Max: Fury Road possibly the best action move of the decade so far. 9/10",NEUTRAL

"May 30, 2015","George Miller paints a striking visual canvas with ""Fury Road"", blending practical effects and dynamic choreography with some truly magnificent CG backdrops (which are often reminiscent of the atmosphere created by those old Star Wars matte paintings). During the films opening sequences I often found myself smiling with a delight at Miller's innovations and ideas (although I hated the silly ""band on wheels"" nonsense - this was at odds with the otherwise grim atmosphere and too far beyond the laws of physics for me to enjoy - it was as if Miller second guessed himself and decided to lighten the mood out of fear that the audience would be too stressed by the action). 

The rudimentary exposition allows the films narrative and concepts to breathe and develop as the chase reaches its conclusion.  Fine performances from the key players (although Hardy's strange accent at times distracts) colour the amazingly detailed set pieces with a forceful human presence but are at best diminished and at worst utterly destroyed by Junkie XL's awful score, which is often unbelievably incongruous and cheap sounding.  I am utterly sick and tired of being told how to feel by a soundtrack, and this mess of hack scoring totally ruined the experience for me several times. 

I wondered if I should feel cheated by the fact that Max is not the protagonist and that this is essentially ""Mad Furiosa"", but I can't think of a good reason why a ""Mad Max"" film can't be told from the point of view of Max as he participates in rather than drives the narrative. ""Fury Road"" is certainly the most interesting story from the series so far.",NEUTRAL

#Friday #May15
 
I only saw #MadMaxBeyondThunderdome of the original #MelGibson #MadMax trilogy. And all I recall from that is the #TinaTurner song and outfits. So, my expectations for this one was quite open (kinda like #MarkWahlbergâ??s remake of #theGambler late last year).
 
Well, this movie makes me wanna forgive #Gibsonâ??s recent transgressions and check out the originals because this film is #offdachain! Itâ??s stunning! The fact that the director is the same as the original Mad Max films is even more incredible. I can honestly say that Iâ??ve NEVER seen anything like this on screen. Ever! Iâ??m not usually a fan of #postapocalyptic depictions on screen (one notable exception: #WillSmithâ??s #IAmLegend). The world portrayed in this movie is reminiscent of #JabatheHuts world in #StarWars #ReturnoftheJedi.
 
The action sequences (pretty much the entire film) will leave you breathless. I literally exhaled at the end of each. They leave you captured. So much so that you miss them when their gone. But, hold on, they will be back!
 
The film has â??Mad Maxâ?? in the tile, but the opening credits lets us know that #TomHardy and #CharlizeTheron have equal billing in the movie. #Hardyâ??s Max is a man of very few words. #Theronâ??s #Furiosa ranks up there with #SigourneyWeaverâ??s #Ripley in #Aliens and #LindaHamiltonâ??s #SarahConnor in the #Terminator movies.
 
What I loved most about the film is that I had no idea what the story was about until he rolled out on the screen. So, I wonâ??t summarize the story here to allow you that same pleasure. As I see it, you will either love this movie or hate this movie. If, after 30 minutes (when the general plot pretty much unfolds) youâ??re not enamored, then not much will happen to change your mind. A shout out to #NicholasHoult (recently seen as #theBeast in the #Xmen films) who plays #Nux, a disciple of #ImmortanJoe. Nux will go to any length necessary to win the #Immortanâ??s praise. Thereâ??s not much back story in this film, which makes it even more incredible. Damn, Iâ??ve already said too much.
 
 
My score: #9outof10",NEUTRAL
"May 30, 2015","It is impossible not to be both dazzled and awe struck by the sheer ingenuity, imagination, intensity and unhinged insanity of the largely analog chase / fight sequences. And George Miller's revisit to his own creation is essentially an extended, adrenaline and rage fueled car chase following the same bleak stretch of terrain twice -- once running away from and then running back. The George Miller's return to his original idea is over flowing with innovation, creativity and intensity when it comes to the visual presentation of what is essentially two brutal Death Metal-like car derby chase and war that stretches the same barren wasteland of sand twice. The level of intensity, violence, gore and mayhem make for one hell of a ride that continues to escalate and amp up with each passing minute. The spectacle of this film is unique and unforgettable.  However, that is pretty much the whole movie. Based on the many praises this film has received I expected something smarter than what I got. There are a number of interesting ideas here but never examined at any level approaching depth. This is just an unusually visually well-crafted ride of horrors. And that carries a great deal of entertainment for a lot of people. Miller's film should be praised but a rating of 98% is over doing it. If you are anticipating something with intellectual or emotional insight, you will be let down. The one new aspect to the Mad Max adventure is Mad Max himself. Tom Hardy is allowed to convey a far more complex, realistic and damaged character. I never picked anything remotely like that from Mel Gibson's Max. In this more fully realized film, Mad Max is a broken man who is not only lost but slowing slipping into insanity as he makes his way through a bleak reality that is a constant barrage of sadistic torture, cruelty and horrors. The visual power of the film is mind-blowing. Sadly, you might feel a bit like Tom Hardy as you leave the cinema and attempt to adjust your senses.",NEUTRAL

"May 30, 2015","Clip your nails: because ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" will have you ruining chair arms if you don't.

George Miller has masterfully welded together a neat, gritty and chaotically choreographed dance of metal mayhem. This point is highlighted with scenes of apocalyptic war drums accompanied by a mad-red jumpsuit donned stringed ax thrasher who strums and picks notes during a-many doomed pursuits.

One of the most talented and varied cinematographers that exists in the industry, John Seale, punches bold and mesmerizing hues of rust, sweat, life and zeal through the audiences' optical pipes, seizing the imagination.

Madman of the hour Max (Tom Hardy) has few lines. Instead, he communicates more by what he doesn't say--which I found ideal for the character. His suspicion that all minds are tortured in one way or another, and how Miller illustrated those mental episodes, lets me feel connected to the character in that special way that elevates a movie from an experience to an interaction.

Rebellious, charming and astute Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) must have missed the memo about the title of the movie. Anyone would have trouble defending Max as being the lead in this movie.  This is not a complaint.

Remaining cast were aces in my book.

Car chases were spectacular and certainly blurred the lines between special and visual effects. My only complaint is that despite the movie being titled ""Fury Road"" there could have been less vehicular venery.

(SPOILER ALERT AHEAD.)
Scale is scoped in epic proportions throughout much of  this flick. Mile high dust storms, desert plains, hordes of monster truck luxury transports, motorcycles and rat-rod clod busters are barely contained on-screen. Encapsulating this fact is at the tail end of the climax as the mixed group of protagonists contemplate their futures into an apparent dried up ocean bed--gazing to the haze of the foreboding horizon. To cross it on motorcycle would take over one hundred and sixty days.

While not my preferred octane of choice, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is an addition to the franchise that many will aspire to replicate, some will use to motivate, but all respectable fans of cinema will appreciate.",NEUTRAL

"May 30, 2015","Last night I saw the finest movie I've seen in a long time - a master epic featuring valiant heroes, a deep resonating story, and a gripping storytelling style that, literally, had me on the edge of my seat. When the credits rolled, I cheered - along with most of the audience. What you may find surprising is that the movie was ""Mad Max - Fury Road."" Critics AND Audiences across the board have given it a rating in the high 90% or 5 stars. I'm already planning to go see it again - soon! Hard people are forced to deal hard times. Heroes are crafted as they continually make the difficult decision to simply keep moving forward. Villains actively pursue wickedness without any of the 'well, mommy didn't love them enough' nonsense so prevalent in media today. Hope betrays, yet hope goes on. The trailers give an accurate depiction of the chaotic, road-warrior style which makes the movie so much fun. Yet, despite the ease with which it could have taken a particular stereotypical road, it chose to be brutal without slipping into gore, and contained almost no bad language or sensuality. Almost unbelievably, most of the over-the-top vehicles, jaw-dropping stunts, and chaotic chase scenes are real, rather than CGI fantasies (I looked it up). Movie-goers have nearly forgotten what real gravity and physics feel like, what punishment the human body and psyche can and can not absorb. This movie reminds us. Go see it if you can, before it's theater showing is replaced with some shallow summer blockbuster designed to take our money and time and give us nothing in return. This movie gave me back a piece of myself - I walked out vibrating with power.

Empecemos por la historia, un mundo postapocalíptico, donde la ley del mas fuerte y la lucha por los recursos básicos de sobrevivencia hacen que la vida sea casi imposible, tribus de sobrevivientes con grandes señores de la guerra imponen su ley. En ese mundo esta Max, el cual es definitivamente un solitario, atormentado por su pasado y evidentemente sufriendo de episodios esquizoides. 
La ambientación en los enormes desiertos australianos es maravillosa, representando un mundo que como ya les dije es solo sangre, fuego y arena. La música acompaña cada momento de manera magistral, desde instrumental hasta tambores japoneses. La secuencias de acción son trepidantes, hace que persecuciones de Rápido y Furioso parezcan paseos en carrusel. Las actuación de Hardy hace honor al personaje interpretado por Gibson y el resto del elenco hace muy bien su trabajo.
La vi con mi hijo de 12 años y me sentí transportado de nuevo a los    80´s, cuando mi papa nos llevaba al cine a mi hermano y a mi, teniendo inclusive menos edad de la que permitían entrar a ver esos grandes clásicos del cine de acción.

"May 30, 2015","So I just saw Mad Max: Fury Road and it was pretty great.  This is that rare blockbuster we get every couple of years that manages to be impressive as a whole.  The biggest thing that surprised me was how much attention to detail their was to the setting and characters.  It's these fun world building ideas that we can infer that is part of what makes this movie so engrossing.  And although it isn't too story driven I'd say this is a movie that understands how ridiculous it is.  I don't know about you but if you're going to show a world without law and order then I expect to see weird and chaotic repercussions.  Key word being show because was it ever refreshing to see a movie that strays away from the common faults it's peers tend to have.  

The most striking being the action.  The action is shot in visceral wide shots with daring stunts.  And although their was action that wasn't practical and relied on cg, they didn't distracted too much from the movie and sometimes even added to overall atmosphere.  Even if that's all that Mad Max was it would still be impressive to me but it took an extra step.  Not only did the action have some real weight to it but so did the emotion.  This is a movie where I felt tension for our characters.  The introspective of the danger happening was clear and I even got Goosebumps on more than one occasion.  

Now unfortunately there are a couple of issues.  Their was a questionable edit of a fade to white that didn't show the contact between a headbutt.  It's the one time it happens in the movie and it's not like the movie shied away from violence so why just that time?  Also I didn't really buy into Max's haunted illusions.  It never felt as serious as much as it was trying to implying.  Personally I'd have preferred if it shown crazier imagery.  This is a look into a psyche of someone who is *puts on shades* Mad?  These illusion do take a noticeable amount of movie so it kept taking me a bit.  There were some bad green screen shots where I swear I saw the hue around the actors.  It's a shame that these small production issues are as noticeable as they are in a movie that has otherwise great set-pieces. 

This is the kind of movie I see growing on me.  As someone who's never seen a Mad Max movie I was pretty damn satisfied.  It was weird, it was self-aware and above all it was just plane fun.  In a year that's been pretty underwhelming I'm happy to say that this is the best movie I've seen so far and I'm giving this an 8/10.",NEUTRAL

"May 29, 2015","This was a really crazy movie. Crazy in a good sense. Driven by a fantastic original music score, the storyline made sense and unlike other action movies, the female Furiosa excellently played by Charlize Theron had more lines than her male counterpart Tom Hardy as Mad Max. Let's not forget some great acting by Nicholas Hoult as Nux who switches sides. He has some really great facial expressions and memorable moments ""Oh what a day! What a lovely day"" he says as he's driving his combat vehicle full speed into battle.
Unlike Mad Max 1, 2 & 3 which were shot only in Australia, this movie was also shot in Namibia and Cape Town South Africa. The Namib desert with its arid rolling sand dunes was a great backdrop for this movie.
I won't spoil the story for you, but this is a must see movie. Never a dull moment. I wouldn't be surprised if you saw some copies of the intriguing Mad Max fighting vehicles at the next Burning Man Festival, Aug 30 - Sep 7, 2015 in the Nevada desert. After all, these vehicles are a form of art as well.

"May 29, 2015","It's good to see an old property brought back and better than ever. No pandering to a PG wide audience, No need for a trilogy or shared universe, no need in a reboot or even bothering to fit the film into existing continuity, just a damn good action film. I also don't get all the apologetic ""there's no plot though"" comments - there is exactly the right amount of plot for the story that's been told. We don't need a prequel film for Furiosa and we only need to spend 10 minutes in the Immortal's world to know everything we need to know about the villain. The world building is hinted at and more disturbing for it. Well thought out action scenes (love all the tricks for car piracy) and a level of insanity throughout. Hardy seems drawn to mumbling roles, Hoult has the most complete arc and is endearingly and unnervingly insane and I think Theron has just joined the club of established actor easily transitions into action hero. I hope this makes loads of money at the box office so that other film makers throw out the cookie cutter and take a risk.

"May 29, 2015","I was under the impression this was going to be a re-make of the original. It is not a re-make. It's another chapter but without Mell. I liked the bare bones nitrous grit of the original a little more, but there's no denying the over-the-top action packed into this latest chapter. It is what it is, and it did it well. The only real drawback for me is that at no point did I feel like I was watching Mad Max. He was so damn forgettable as a character that it ended up being all about the ridiculously out of place ""breeder girls"", as beautiful as they were--they were the story line and the story line was equally ridiculous, to the point of almost getting in the way of the action.

This film deserves such hype.

Within the first 30 minutes there was a point where I got up and started pacing the room. It is that exciting. Miller and the rest really brought something special. I felt guilty skipping the credits, because of just how immense a team it took to create such a unique environment. Did you see how many people were on stunts?!

"May 28, 2015","I watched this on an airplane, just as everyone else was leaving. It's probably not an ideal setting to watch this A-list action movie, but that's okay. I jotted down notes. Here they are:
- My first Mad Max movie
- Great action movie, decent drama
- Action was fun and extremely fast-paced, sometimes to the level of not following what was happening
- I did enjoy the action, but for a two-hour movie, it could have used more variety
- Sprawling world of a desert, which, as empty as it was, was easy to understand in its geography
- Disconnection between characters led to an aura of mystery
- The cause was established in a short and sweet package; don't expect anything revolutionary or elaborate
- Characters connect simply on grounds of not liking status quo and seeking redemption, without one of our heroes (Tom Hardy) even revealing his name until near the climax
- Extra points for avoiding romantic mumbo jumbo in favour of developing strong female roles, led by Charlize Theron
- Ultimately, redemption is achieved...? It's unclear, perhaps so that sequels are justified

To round up my points in a paragraph, I hesitate to hail this as one of the best action movies of all time. None of the characters were memorable, even in their mysterious ways. Neither was there a singular great action moment that still resonates in me. The whole package was definitely greater than the sum of its parts, and, as a whole, I had a good time. As a drama, the relationships between all of the characters, with a silent agreement to fight for the same cause, intrigued me most. As an action movie, I can see myself having an even greater time, when watching this on a screen larger than my head. I cannot speak for Mad Max fans, so as a newcomer to the franchise, I dig the world. You are definitely still relevant, George Miller.",NEUTRAL
"May 28, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best looking films I've seen in recent years and in many ways.

The film is proudly insane, from the over the top characters, to the incredible stunts performed, Mad Max is the best blockbuster of the summer.",NEUTRAL
"May 28, 2015","Mad Max is a spectacle. Perhaps the most beautiful action movie I've ever seen due to its fluid action sequences, intense color juxtaposition, and grand-scale set pieces.

"May 28, 2015","Get ready for a high octane, all out, no lack of action movie with Mad Max: Fury Road. Now, before you go thinking that this is just a movie for the action and effects-wait, this movie is pretty much about the action and effects, but seriously, all the action is for a purpose and underlying watching a demolition derby on screen is an interesting story that is told from Furiosa who is attempting to rescue unwilling woman from basically, let's call it a cult. The movie might be called Mad Max and trust me, we get plenty of madness and Max but the bulk of the film centers on Furiosa and her plan, which involves the aid of Max. Mad Max: Fury Road is also a much, much better take on the subject of what happens when a post-apocalyptic world is filled with different groups fighting over, what else, water and oil-so remember how muddled the movie WaterWorld was? OK, I'll gave you this, most people, it's still a sore subject for Kevin Costner, don't want to remember WaterWorld; in any case, Mad Max is quite an upgrade.",NEUTRAL

"May 28, 2015","Thirty years after Thunder Dome,George Miller is held with the mammoth task of bringing his iconic genre defining story back from the ashes,and boy does he deliver,12 years of work and preparation pays off in this adrenaline pumping,visceral un-apologetic intense embodiment of visual ecstasy, that drives you down the depths of dirt road hell at 400 km per hour living you dazed, confused, nauseated and entertained.
Fury Road is a movie that absolutely thrives in the arena of cinematography,action sequence,art designs and scenery.I will go as far as saying Miller may have just re envisioned a new way of plotting the action scenes at rapid intense pace that will shake up the movie universe for ever.I don't think i have seen anything like this before.It almost combines elements of old movie making with a modern cinematic land scape(i smell oscars!!).The levels of inventions are high and very poetic. Michael Bay,Jerry? are you watching?,you could learn a thing or two about inventing new action sequences without over reliance on rehashed sloppy c.g.i scenery.
For all the great big action sequences Fury Road is movie that is not without weaknesses,the character development and plot execution are a bit troubling.
On face value,Tom Hardy seemed a perfect fit for the role of a steely cold bad ass Max,but was he a little too perfect for the role? Hardy suffers from what i call 'co star syndrome' were no matter the role given,the personality of the actor always renders him a well suited co-star.Hardy feels like a co-star in his own movie,his lack of charisma coupled with his anti social mood means personality falls away in the dark shadows of the movie leading the way for CharlizeTheron and Nichola Hoult to steal the spotlight as soul and heart of the movie.
In terms of the plot,unfortunately for Fury Road,for all the beautiful artistic scenery,the story is exhausting and a bit flat,i feel it could have had a bigger edge to it.
Despite its shortfalls,Fury Road artistic theme and visual imagery is were the movie hits a home run! It feels like a dark comic book that is literally brought to life with grand gestures.Fury Road is like a symphony orchestrated by vibrant colorful characters that whisk you away from your seat into a scary hellish dystopia riddled with a surprisingly well balanced dish of male masculinity and feminist renaissance . All in all,Fury Road is a classic tale of big bad bully v.s unlikely protagonist that can be thoroughly enjoyed by the tester-one fueled action junkies.",NEUTRAL

Miller didn't spoonfeed you a plot either, which is what most are used to these days with modern films. The story was there, but you had to take it in visually, and fill it the gaps yourself.

"May 27, 2015","I don't understand action movies, so I think I was searching a little too hard for the plot during Mad Max: Fury Road. It had me on the edge of my seat for much of the movie, but there was a lot of material left to be desired. That electric guitar player, though",NEUTRAL
"May 27, 2015",Neither more nor less of what I expected. Thanks to George Miller for keeping the aesthetic of the previous entries in the series. That's something I really appreciate. Highly recommendable!!!!,NEUTRAL
"May 27, 2015","Ever since I saw the trailer for Mad Max: Fury Road I've been excited to see it, but the funny thing is I hadn't seen the previous movies and that's the great thing about this movie; you don't need to. Mad Max: Fury Road is exactly what the title suggests! This guy Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) whom is not of sound mind is forced to survive in this post apocalyptic world but he isn't the only one as he is quickly ambushed and taken to be used as a ""blood bag"" by a creature called Nux (Nicholas Hoult). I got the impression that most of these people have become a little nuts which is best summed up by Max himself ""as the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else"".

Taking into consideration this movie is an out and out action flick (the plot isn't great but it's tolerable for what this movie is) but it's the women who grab this movie by the balls. Lead by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) whose plan to free a harem of imprisoned women from the clutches of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and once Joe realises something is wrong he sends an army of these loose-cannon nut-jobs (who view Immortan Joe as a God) in pursuit of his property.

Accelerated maybe by recent action franchises (Fast & Furious, Marvel universe), Mad Max: Fury Road has had an adrenaline shot to the heart (or some shiny metallic spray paint?). This movie is relentless (I'm not kidding), from start to finishes it is pure-fast paced action and I LOVED IT! I mean I haven't seen a film with such intensity since The Raid and that's no easy task! I believe we have the father of the Mad Max franchise George Miller to thank for this.

George Miller has done a truly outstanding job in creating Mad Max and has directed every single movie, nurturing and developing this chaotic world. A special mention needs to be said for the visual effects also, there's this one scene where they're all driving through the desert and they drive right into a huge desert tornado and it was just amazing to see.

Met all my expectations and I will now be watching the previous films!",NEUTRAL

"May 27, 2015","Remakes are often refreshing for nostalgic experiences, and yet I went to see this movie before watching the original Mad Max films. After watching all four of them, I can give my opinion on this one. It takes every good aspects of the original movies and improves them, esepcially the action sequence of the Road Warrior. The action is very well choreographed to where it's easy to follow the chaos and that alone tells the story perfectly. This is for sure the best action movie I've watched in a long time.",NEUTRAL
"May 27, 2015","Probably should have stuck with my initial low expectations of the movie. Then I wouldn't have been so disappointed. After hearing the high praise for weeks, it turns out to be another generic, loud, CGI infested (I don't care what they say, there's a ton of CGI in it), summer action-adventure. The only thing ""Mad Max"" about it is the name and some of the character's accents.",NEUTRAL
"May 27, 2015","When you go to a movie, you want to be entertained. When you go see Mad Max: Fury Road, you are not only entertained, you leave feeling exhausted. From start to finish, this movie grabs you and pulls you into the action. The characters stand on their own, but mesh together even better. There's no need for pithy dialogue, or funny one liners like the 80's and 90's action flicks. There is no need to see the previous Mad Max movies prior to seeing this. I'm happy the George Miller was able to make a movie in this time period where movie making allows him to excel. Out of 2 hours of film, there is about 15 min of downtime. It also brings in probably the best portrayal of a post-apocalyptic world that I've seen in a film. Tom Hardy embodies the crazy, and Charlize Theron brings in an amazing badass woman portrayal. To me, this movie is perfect.",NEUTRAL

The world is a dark and dreary place and resources are in short supply.  Immortan Joe is a ruthless leader and slave owner that rules over his land with his many wives.  One of his slaves, Imperator Furiosa, who is supposed to drive one of his gas tankers to Gastown uses this job as an opportunity to rescue the slave wives and take them to the green land, where she is originally from.  She runs into another escaping slave, Max, and the two join forces in their escape attempt.

""I live.  I die.  I live again.""

George Miller, director of Mad Max, Mad Max: Road Warrior, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, The Witches of Eastwick, Lorenzo's Oil, Happy Feet, and Happy Feet 2, delivers Mad Max: Fury Road.  The storyline for this picture is very well executed and does a great job of delivering the character and the universe.  The action and settings are perfectly done and the make-up and costumes were spot on.  The acting is marvelous and the cast includes Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz, and Hugh Keays-Byrne.

""Remember me.""

We saw this at the drive-in last weekend and I thought it was awesome.  I thought it was cool how they jumped right into the story and it felt a little like the Thunderdome plot.  There is a lot of room to deliver a prequel or continued adventure in the current Max universe.  This was a well done film that hopefully turns into a trilogy.

"May 27, 2015",Bringing the spectacle back to Australian films! The vision of this hype-realistic film works very nicely. The physical performances and the action pieces make thrilling but there were a few tender moments to break up all the chaos. Although not much on character development it was enough and all in all this film is to entertain and it did that 100%,NEUTRAL
"May 27, 2015","To put it simply this is not a Mad Max movie, but rather just a thin story with an impressive car chase in the desert borrowing the franchise title.

George Miller for some reason has removed all of Max's humor, wit and cleverness which made the previous three films great, in addition to making the title character a sidekick in his own movie. While both Charlize and Tom are great actors the seriousness of this story bares no resemblance to the original story line.

While the cinematography in this film is impressive, it is for the most part unnecessary and over done. As a fellow Australian George, I'm sad to say this movie was kind of disappointing, even if it was a visual masterpiece.",NEUTRAL

"May 27, 2015","Honestly, there's nothing I can really say that was dissatisfactory. The concept of the film was quite unique (obviously based off the 1980s film) and the cast was perfectly picked. The main female star shined the brightest in my opinion and I would be curious to see her in hopefully new upcoming roles.  The one thing I loved the most about the film was its art style. Usually you'd expect a movie solely based in the desert to lack color but they decided to do the opposite and by increasing the contrast it also increased the intensity of the overall film which I would say is a definite plus! Surprisingly for a film solely based on a long car chase, there was not a dull moment. It was enjoyable from start to finish! Although this was a fantastic movie, I would not recommend this to younger audiences, for it was gory and violent. But I don't have much more to say, if you have a chance to see this film, please do! It'll make a great addition to my collection once it's released on bluray!",NEUTRAL
"May 27, 2015",High speed tightly packed action with guitar revving in the foreground and you had me at Hello. The movie looks straight out of a graphic novel and with complete artistic license it could have been overboard but was well managed. Theron is good and so is Hoult. In some ways so is Bane oops well not really. But its the high speed motorcade sequences that steal your breadth away along with the thumping sound. Job well done!,NEUTRAL

Not only is it brilliantly acted and directed, but it brings a great amount of intellectualism and sophistication to the Sci-Fi/Action genre.

As a secondary character, Max, helps the actual lead character , played by Theron, by grunting , brute vigor , and mostly ridiculous luck, through a 2 hour car chase .. basically to end up where they started...

"May 26, 2015","When I saw the trailers last year I nearly peed my pants, and then, I witnessed a years worth of anticipation get flushed down the toilet watching basically the longest thinnest plot lines drive from A to B to A, in all be it a most artistic fashion.  The imagination was glorious, but I need substance to complete the celluloid experience, I want meat on a beautiful skeleton.  This movie receiving the high acclaim makes me feel lonely, and suspicious of all future movie reviews good or bad.  I'm generally on board with most critics, but when I'm in such a lonely camp, it makes me wonder if we see movies now just for a spectacle and not the story.  This is basically the first two movies remixed into a dub step like cacophony without any smooth lulling rhythm to make you care for anyone.  The movie tries earnestly like a precocious child to show you how successful it is at providing depth and meaning, but translated into 15 sec. close ups articulating something that the movie hadn't patience or depth to understand.  I feel betrayed, this was supposed to be an homage to the filth which followed the first two films, in our time...in my time!  One thing is for certain, this one will join Beyond Thunderdome into the Thunderdumpster.",NEUTRAL

"May 26, 2015","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is such a unique, heart-pounding visual thrill that you'll need to catch your breath when it's done. George Miller delivers a perfect action film that blends artistry with road-rage in this post-appocolyptic feature. Mad Max (Tom Hardy) and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) highjack a war rig to take five prized young women to salvation, a piece of green land in the middle of a desert wasteland. Only, they are being followed by a band of ghostly, diesel-injected attackers, bent on revenge. 'Fury Road' doesn't under deliver on its name: there are explosions, races, and twists to keep the audience on the edge of the theater seats. Still, the 'Mad Max' part is what sticks with the viewer, as George Miller has created a disturbingly wonderful glimpse into the maddening reality of raw, human nature in the most extreme circumstances.",NEUTRAL

This isn't a film with a story arc, or character development, or even an attempt at either. No, Mad Max Fury Road starts revving the engines and when it hits the gas pedal, it doesn't let up.
This may not be for everyone but for those wanting a little action and post apocalyptic mayhem, it's right up their alley. The 3D is actually quite good for a film of this nature. I was surprised at how effective it was considering most the film takes place in open desert areas.

There is however plenty of driving, some great violence and a fair amount of anarchy. Not to mention the most hilarious post apocalyptic guitarist in the history of absurdity. 

I really don't know what the movie was all about since the plot is also MIA. However i do remember some hot women barely dressed but with some hot piercings. Also, let's not forget the killer grandmas.

The only thing missing in this movie is some actual violence. There could be so much more. If Robert Rodriguez had directed this the blood and guts would have been magical.

"May 26, 2015","When I went to the cinema to see this film, I had pretty high expectations for it, and by the time then film had finished, I was blown away by a truly spectacular cinematic experience. This was one of those films that I knew would be an awesome ride from beginning to end, and you'll know it right from the start. While there may be a few things I could nitpick about the story, it is very engaging, and with all the high-octane vehicular action, you'll always be on the edge of your seat wondering if the main characters will make it alive, and if they do, you'll feel incredibly relieved. I know that's how I felt. The characters have a surprising amount of depth, and the performances are loud and proud, with the possible exception of Mad Max. This film's version of Max doesn't really talk much, but he develops significantly as character. He goes from being a tortured body and soul to being an incredibly self-confident hero whose actions speak louder than words. The visuals were outstanding, and although I'm aware that this is a CGI-laden action film, this is one of those films where the special effects work to the benefit of the cinematic experience rather than detracting from it. The cars, the costumes, and the environment all looked like they were done to perfection, in that they reflected the gloriously crazy, over-the-top nature of the film, although nothing hammers the point home quite like a flame-spewing guitar. The overall atmosphere is very intense, to the point that it's contagious. It keeps your eyes to the screen, and it really got my heart pounding. Of course, this film would not be complete with the action, and let it be known that this is debatably the most intense and explosive chase film ever to grace the silver screen, with relentless action scenes that you simply have to see to believe, and no description will ever do it justice. With all sincerity, I can say that this is perhaps the best film of the decade. It sets out to define itself as more than just a good action film. In fact, with the way the characters are depicted, and the film's excellent handling of the timeless themes of survival and tyranny, I'd say that this film is the definitive post-modern action film, and one that I feel will set the standard for future films in the genre.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015","I was really excited to see this, as I am a big fan of the earlier movies.  But for all the hype about ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", I found it to be a disappointment. Unlike the previous Mad Max movies, they spent little time with character and background story development. They plop you into the setting, then non-stop action for 2 hours. Sure there were lots of cool vehicles, great costumes, stunts and special effects, but for me, that doesn't make for the thin story telling and lack of character development. 

If you're a fan of the original movies, seriously, don't bother.  If you just want to see crazy stunts, vehicles, and costumes and basically a 2 hour car chase, then you'll probably enjoy it.",NEUTRAL

""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was everything I expected when I watched the trailer 64 or so times, and more. When watching the trailer, I presumed the film was going to be a 2 hour dramatic and violent/explosive chase. That is exactly what it was. 

Now, let's list some pros and cons. 

Pros:
 - The entire movie
 - Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, Hoult as Nux, Theron as Imperator Furiosa 
 - The unbelievable special effects
 - The unbelievable total picture of the film; beautiful. 

Cons: 
 - Lack of screen time/Development for Immortan Joe  
 - Confusion
 
George Miller did a superb job of crafting ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". I felt very shallow putting a cons list on this movie, but it is just the way I review. The movie was beautiful. If it is possible to say that about a post apocalyptic chaser film, then this movie deserves the award of beautiful. The film is edgy, sharp and all around fantastic. The way that Tom Hardy does not have a line for the first forty minutes? Genius. The way the film does not really have a set up? Genius. It starts and goes to the end in one 2-hour barrage of crazed action. 

Watching the trailer, I could not contain my excitement to see Immortan Joe. He seemed like one of the coolest, bad ass villains of the decade. Immortan Joe is a dictator and ruler of all due to his ownership over basic needs such as water and gasoline. In the beginning of the movie, he releases water from a man made dispenser high into a structure where he and his brothers can scout above in an overview. He grumbles ""My friends, do not become addicted to water."" What a bad ass, does he not even drink water?!

As the movie continued, I kept wanting more of Immortan Joe. He was there, and he was pretty bad ass, but it just felt like he wasn't in it ""enough"". This is a spoiler-free review, so I cannot express my feelings of the ending and the antics that took place in the 2nd half of the movie.

I saw the film during a Friday matinee with a friend. Oddly, we were the only two in the theater. I mean yeah it was at 4:30 p.m., but come on! Anyways, there were at least 3 times when I turned to my friend, who has also never seen a ""Mad Max"" film, and asked ""Do you have any clue what is going on?"" He always responded with a chuckle and ""Nah."" There were a couple moments when Nux and other War Boys were spraying chrome spray all over their mouths, *SPOILER* (oops) Rictus Erectus, Joe's brother, yelling ""I HAD A BABY BROTHER, AND HE WAS PERFECT! I HAD A BABY BROTHER AND HE WAS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY"" After someone who hasn't been in the movie previously had a great time cutting into Angharad, Joe's heavily pregnant wife, which was just run over by Joe accidentally, mortally wounding her and the child. I assume that a lot of these moments that I did not understand were in the old ""Mad Max"" movies. If this is the case, this is totally on me and I need to watch the old movies before watching a new one. If not, what the hell was going on?!

In the end ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Great performances by everyone! 

P.S., Slit was made out to be a bad ass character in the trailer, wanted more out of him!",NEUTRAL

"May 26, 2015",Try watch it in Atmos Sound System - the sound will blow your head. 3D? No 3D in 3D movie. Screenplay? One letter page. Effects? WOW! It's movie perfect for big boys who never grow up. Oww... Nicholas Hoult make this movie great!,NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015","If I could give it a zero, I would!",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015","If you like fast action with a little bit of sci-fi this movie is perfect for you. I am into girly, drama films and still loved this movie which is the complete opposite. I say its a much was on 3D.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015","After this movie ended, I realised that there isn't a strong story that backs up the movie; its like something that is going round and round itself. I enjoyed watching it for the first time frankly because of the action thats packed into it. But will I watch it again? Yes, indeed.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015","It's like the game Borderlands, that was inspired by the original, went on to inspire this remake.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015",Barely watchable.  I read the reviews and I want to see that movie.  THIS movie was terrible.  First movie I have wanted to walk out of in years.  I am shocked by the reviews.,NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015","This action-fest is a visual treat for about 10 minutes, and then hits the repeat button over and over and over and over and over again. The plot is non-existent, and the writing dreadful - did it really take three people to get Max to grunt for the first half of the film? At times I felt sorry for the actors, attempting to do their best with what little they were given but none of them quite right for the part. Theron lacks heft, Hardy lacks Hart, and everyone else is a thin cartoon character. While the visuals are lush and glorious and the camera work superb, the editing is amateurish and breaks the atmosphere. Frankly, one of the worst movies of the year. I have no idea how the rating is so high? Maybe I was in the wrong theatre?",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015",2 hours and $40 I'll never get back. What a piece of crap -- pure violence porn.  What does it say about our society that this movie is so popular?  Nothing good.,NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015","Es una muy bien hecha película de acción, sin baches a pesar de su guión básico y algo monótono. Actuaciones convincentes, escenarios y ambientación potentísimos. Para verla.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015","Would not have gone if the men's rights freaks hadn't been carrying on about it, but can't imagine what their problem was, it was definitely not a feminist propaganda movie - lol. Rollicking good action flick though, loved it, on the edge of my seat.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015",Turn your brain off and just watch.  Amazing special effects and fantastic story telling.,NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015","Total masterpiece by Miller. Really recommend this title to anyone, the performances, stunts, scenery, story, and pretty much everything is well on point, although it needed a bit more dialogue from Hardy.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015","Not only the best film I have seen this year but also in my lifetime. Mad Max: Fury Road is even better than ""The Road Warrior"" which is considered the best of the old trilogy. It is a multi-layered action spectacle that has few quiet moments, immense energy and a very inclusive cast of characters. Mad Max is amazing and is even the best 3D movie I have seen which I'm not a fan of 3D at all.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015","This movie blew my mind. Things only seem to slow down twice, and that was a needed intermission between all the edge-of-your-seat action. I can't wait to buy this movie",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015",Amazingly badass. Enough said,NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015","Zu aller erst, die Action-Highlights und Meisterwerke der letzten 30 Jahre (auf Vollständigkeit kommt  es mir hier nicht an, darf aber von den Leser  gerne erweitert werden ;-) ):
Indiana Jones und der Tempel des Todes, Terminator 2, Speed, The Matrix, Crank, Casino Royale, Das Bourne Ultimatum, The Dark Knight, The Raid und jetzt Mad Max: Fury Road.
Dieser Film ist ein Meisterwerk und ich bin mir fast sicher dass er das Action-Genre maßgeblich beeinflussen wird.
Ich habe noch nie einen Film gesehen der solch einen hohen Actionanteil hat.    Noch dazu ist die Action nicht ermüdend wie z.B.: in Transformers oder Man of Steel, sondern sie ist genauso wie die Story, simple (was hier absolut positiv gemeint ist), mitreißend, intelligent und funktional  gemacht. Vielleicht zeigt Fury Road Hollywood dass die Handgemachte Action (sprich Explosionen und Stunts) immer noch besser funktioniert als dieses lästige und nicht zuletzt uninteressante CGI-Gedöns.
Über die Darsteller braucht man kein Wort verlieren, sie liefern schlichtweg  Perfektleistungen ab.
Diesem Film ist ein finanzieller Erfolg zu wünschen, denn Mad Max 4 hat ihn einfach verdient. Man muss schon stark überlegen wann man zuletzt solch ein gut gemachter (Action-)Film gesehen hat, auch abhängig von seiner Dimension.
Es sollte auch betont werden dass dieser Film ein perfekter KINOfilm ist, den man in eben diesen gesehen haben sollte. Also schnell ins Kino rennen =)",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2015",Oerrated and overdone tripe.  Negligible story sublimated to endless battle scenes.  The film is less than allegorical but does not pass suspension of disbelief.  This one has great ratings but I felt like walking out and definitely should have.  I can't see any redemption here.,NEUTRAL

"May 26, 2015","Loved Road Warrior and Thunderdome.  Hated this.  I don't understand all the other reviewers, I kept waiting for Mad Max to actually speak.  Mad Max was really just a supporting part.  The whole movie was just a two hour ridiculous and violent car chase.",NEUTRAL

"May 25, 2015","Perhaps I am acting a bit prematurely on this one, but I know what I like and I love this movie. Many of the movies I am selecting have hit me on an emotional level, as well as excelling in craft and artistry and this film is no different. When ideas are conveyed through action, you have my attention. When the intelligence of the film-goer is respected, you have my admiration. And when you have me invested all the while through a two hour film without losing me once, you have my heart. This is one of the best films I have ever seen hands down. This should be studied for years to come. Top 10 for sure.",NEUTRAL

"May 25, 2015",A rollercoaster ride from the beginning to the end. Best action/thriller movie so far this year.,NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2015","What a Lovely Day Indeed.

Writer-Director George Miller has revisited and reinvented his Mad Max franchise quite flamboyantly. In full disclosure, I had no idea that Mad Max was a pre existing franchise until after I saw the first trailer for the film. Although, When I saw Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, I became slightly interested. I believed that these two oozed amazing chemistry. Like the previous installments, there was a nuclear war that led us to this post-apocalyptic world. Food and water are noticeably scarce. From beginning to end, it is non-stop over the top action. It fairly reminded me of the old video game 'Twisted Metal"" which we all know is all about absolute mayhem. So many explosions, so many collisions, so much anarchy!!!! This film roars with an absolute vengeance!!!!!!
     Every aspect of the film is beautiful. The score by Junkie XL was absolutely riveting. It had my heart racing when the action started up and it just felt so perfect. It really placed the film on a more grand scale. This really excites me because XL produced the score for the upcoming film Dawn of Justice, along with Hans Zimmer. So, I am definitely intrigued to see what those two were able to accomplish together. My favorite thing about the film was definitely the camera work. The way that George Miller and John Seale were able to make this world look so visually stunning yet still so destitute is by far some of the best camera work I have seen this year. The rotations and the tracking shots were just wonderful to see. This a film that is made for the big screen. It is absolutely visually stunning. The vehicles they created for this film look like something straight out of a comic book and when you see them you can't help but to stare in awe. It makes this world of desperation something to be slightly desired. The acting definitely is a high point for me as well, because the ball could have easily been dropped if not handled properly. For instance, when Charlize Theron is on screen, she steals every second. She is almost unrecognizable as a tortured soul who has had enough of this so called society. Everything that she does seems so instinctual and sometimes, although justified, barbaric. She really becomes her character and allows herself to be taken into this world.
For those that may have grown a bit tired of the post- apocalyptic films that we have been bombarded with over the years, fear not, for Mad Max: Fury Road has successfully changed the game. In the beginning sequence of the film, we meet the eponymous character Max Rockatansky, played by the incomparable Tom Hardy. We quickly realize that he is already in a bit of a pickle. Just from the opening ten minutes, we learn that he's a troubled soul and that he is doing the same thing that everyone else in this world has been forced to do: survive. His survival skills are instantly put to the test once he is captured by the War Boys, the army of Immortan Joe, the film's main antagonist. The capture scene is so well choreographed and so amazing to watch. The world that Miller creates is so unique and beautiful: something that only his mind could conjure up. It's an absolute barren wasteland full of vehicular warfare of the greatest caliber. The film is full of a mass population that looks savage; however, these are just everyday people that are trying to survive. At this time, all that people know is carnage, chaos and catastrophe. Naturally, we should all be able to relate to the survival aspect. There is no order. Only a seemingly tyrannical rule, led by one Immortan Joe. There are some who follow, hence his army of War Boys, and there are some that believe that he is the reason that the world is still the way it is, insert Imperator Furiosa.
     Fury Road explains how Max, who seems to be a bit of a drifter, meets and works with Imperator Furiosa. Once these two meet up, it is non-stop action. While the action slows down a bit, you learn Furiosa's purpose and it is a rather plausible story arc. As a moviegoer who appreciates dialogue, I was a bit disappointed in some of the writing. Some of it seemed to be forced and other parts seem like they did not belong at all. For example, there is one instance in the film where Miller tries to create some emotional investment between two of the characters. However, in my opinion, it translate well. The film is well paced and at a run time of 2 hours flat, it's a really good film to go see with friends especially if you are an action junkie. Oddly enough, after watching this film, I do not have any interest in viewing the original Mad Max trilogy starring Mel Gibson. I loved this film and I just feel like this is something that can very well stand on its own. A very interesting take on a post apocalyptic world from the Mastermind George Miller. He successfully created one of the best action films I've ever seen.",NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2015","Wow!  That's what another guy coming out of the theatre said after the movie said, ""That was amazing!""  If you want to see almost non-stop action and see all kinds of shit blow up then this is the movie for you.  It is almost like a non-stop chase scene in the dystopian future.  They do manage to fit in plot and character development so you actually care about what is happening and why.  The visuals are pretty amazing and not for those who are easily put off by people with mouths sewed shut or gross skin conditions, missing limbs, or other weird deformities brought on by whatever nuclear apocalypse ""killed the world""  Charlize Theron kicks Ass and Thomas Hardy isn't a bad sidekick.",NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2015",great action. really weird.,NEUTRAL

"May 25, 2015",That was the worst film EVER. EVER!! I wanted to walk out soooooo bad. Haven't felt so bored in a movie since Twin Peaks. This movie is one LONG car chase/war scene. Period. There is literally NOTHING else going on in the movie. I want my $30 back!!,NEUTRAL

The personalty of max is bad as shit Tom Hardy interpretated max so bad that even Nicolas Cage could did better, in my opinion Chris Pratt could did better and max dont have almost any close on this movie like Furiosa have more personality than max, could the movie been called ""Mad Furiosa Fury Road""? so this movoe is bad as shit sorry but i hated it",NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2015",I've never been compelled to leave a review until now.  This movie has received overwhelming acclaim and I have vowed to remove any friend on my FB page that claims to enjoy it.  Worst movie imaginable.  I'm embarassed to have given money to this load of shit.,NEUTRAL

"May 25, 2015","Knowing what it is, a comic book movie, with the main attraction is CGI Graphics, 90% action, and some story, This filled all the checkboxes. Theron is super as is Hardy. Supporting cast did their thing. Or course, no industry recognition for this, but a good use of 2 hours.",NEUTRAL

"May 25, 2015","This was so far the weakest movie I have seen this year  The acting was sub-par, the effects were below average, the story line was far to weak (and I wasn't expecting hardly any story line).  The effects in Avengers AoU were far better, and as for story line, Furious 7 which I went to see just for action and cars, was much better.  I regret the time wasted watching this movie and at least I only spent matinee money on it.",NEUTRAL

"May 25, 2015",A great spectacular explosion of nonsense.  No story or character development.  Max plays second fiddle to the real star Charlize Theron. The movie is one over long chase scene afrom point A to point B and back to point A again. I'm giving it a star for the vehicles and costumes.

"May 25, 2015","I can't remember the last time I left the theater and felt the way I did when I saw Fury Road.  As if I just witnessed some massive event unfold in front of my eyes.  In a time of over-CGI Marvel movies, Fury Road stands out with excellent visuals and an incredible cast.",NEUTRAL

"May 25, 2015","Very good movie and action packed, but  a little less believable than the originals which brings this down just a tad bit.  Main points of contention is the widescale use of guns, a fully operational mind operated bionic arm, and that they never explain the war boys issues or origin.  Other than that there is not much not to like IMO, unless you are very violence adverse.   Maybe a slight shallow in plot development, but what else did you expect from this movie.

"May 25, 2015","Lo de Hardy no esta tan bueno porque ya Max esta muy, pero muy, Mad. Es quizá lo único malo de la pelícua, el giro que tuvo su personaje a la locura total. De resto es esplendorosa, el mundo post apocalíptico que muestra es grandioso, la música es genial y las escenas de acción supremas. El papel de Theron muy bueno, el de Hugh Keays-Byrne todo un tributazo con un gran trabajo y el pequeño Nicholas Hoult que cada vez lo hace mejor. Gran película a pesar de todo el temor de recalentar un clásico.",NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2015",frightening! action pack from start to finish,NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2015",After Mel Gibsons success in the Classic and most fun movies I have seen. Tom Hardy comes along and just plain kills it. Charlize Theron is basically the one that's badass in this but Tom Hardy did most of the Job. With the weirdness and most disturbing moments. Mad Max Fury Road is sure one of my Favorite ever yet.,NEUTRAL

"May 25, 2015",Eye-poppingly amazing action movie. Light on plot but more than you'd expect and they do a decent job of making you care about the characters. Uses old cliches to good effect. The great car(?) chases reminded me of the Indiana Jones 3 tank scene - visceral and thrilling. Recommended!,NEUTRAL

"May 25, 2015","George Miller is an absolute visionary and brings to life the most chaotic and stunning post-apocalyptic world ever to be seen in film. Acting, visuals, storyline, and action are all of the highest quality. This installment of Mad Max is on par with the Road Warrior. By far the best movie of the year so far. A must see!",NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2015","Having never seen any of the previous Mad Max films I was a bit hesitant to jump into this one, but after hearing such great things about Fury Road I had to see what the fuss was about. Fury Road is an amazing action movie, and the type of action movie you just don't see any more: One that isn't mindless mind-numbing CG nonsense. Even though this film is pretty much a two hour chase scene, it still takes a few moments to let you catch your breath now and again. It has genuine character development. And it has a female character not just supporting the male lead, but actually holding her own. In fact, what is most monumental about the story is how the two main leads help each other, playing to each others' strengths, throughout the story. They use teamwork. Not a man saving a woman, or a woman saving the day despite the fact that she is a woman, but two people, working together, regardless of gender.

The film's world is fully realized, yet never clumsily explained. Things just are the way they are, and we can enjoy seeing it, without having it shoved down our throats. Many of the big action set-pieces utilize practical effects, real explosions, incredible specially made vehicles, and even dummies rather than CG humans when the story called for someone to kick the bucket. Sure there are some CG flourishes here and there, and even a big sandstorm that's all effects, but it's always done with the weight and reality of an old-school movie before computers took over. I enjoyed story, characters, and the entire ride. Would watch again.",NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2015",An exuberant chase film which passes by extremely quickly. The story is paper thin though and dialogue is very limited. It constitutes a thoroughly entertaining B movie but despite the hype it's no more than that.,NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2015",That was one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The script writing was mediocre and almost non-existent. The only character development was Mad Max deciding he would need Furiosa to live and visa versa. The show had weird feminist undertones that seemed incredibly forced and did not fit within the film at all. The entire film was just constant action with loads of insane and well done special effects. It's almost impossible to make even a small connection with the main character(s?) and you feel no emotion in regards to their situation. All the great special effects and good acting was wasted on something that is just incredibly disappointing.,NEUTRAL

"May 25, 2015","There come times in movie history where a genre defining film is created, something so magnificent and grand that it forever affects the films of the future. Mad Max: Fury Road is a film that your grandchildren will ask if you saw it in theaters, and those of us who did will be proud to tell our children ""yes.""

The movie begins with picking the audience up and placing them in the universe of Mad Max: where packs of roving guzzoline seeking bandits and psychopaths dwell, killing all who oppose them, and where two headed, irradiated lizards are eaten raw without a second thought. The sheer deadness of the world is gorgeous, and the fact that they use very little CGI brings it home. When the audience sees the stunts, cars flipping, exploding, stuntmen being thrown from them as they careen into canyon walls, they see real people and vehicles. Too often has a overly digital set and stunts made an action movie a sterile pool of disgusting brackish water, and bland characters who are either immortal or unlikable only add to it. Yet, Mad Max is the opposite: Max and Furiosa are very mortal, and their peril is real. Max is strapped to the front of a car and driven around the desert while being used as a blood bag, and Furiosa comes quite near death on several occasions. The enemies are made human by the addition of Nux, a War Boy who joins the protagonists, and only serves the Big Bad due to a religious devotion instilled in him by brainwashing. The Five Wives are very human, and compelling, given varied personalities. The movie, despite being an action packed thrill ride, makes time for subtle character development along the way.

And this movie is truly a nonstop action scene. Perhaps fifteen minutes of its almost two hour stretch were slow, and its constant adrenaline rush makes one near mad. Every single bit of it is George Miller's genius, and it is truly unusual in the times of shallow plots and characters in action, where stunts are fake and blows softened by the cutting of a camera.

Watch this movie.",NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2015","It's funny. For a long time, I wasn't interested in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". I saw the trailers and I just wasn't buying into it. I mean, I thought it visually looked great, but I didn't think it was going to be that good. Looking back, I don't know what the hell I was thinking. As the release got closer and the film ended up with a 99% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes and every critic I listen to raved about the movie, then I went from zero interest to dying to see this movie. I couldn't opening weekend but I finally got to see it this weekend, and oh my God. This is one hell of a ride. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" opens with our titular hero(?), now played by Tom Hardy, captured and taken prisoner. Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) is the leader of an almost cult-following civilization. The movie kicks off when one of his trusted followers, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who is supposed to be getting gasoline from an outpost, betrays him by stealing his wives and escaping. Joe rallies his troops to pursue them and chaos breaks out...

Why was the Earth dying??? Why were all those people sick???, how did the one dude rise to power??? Like...what was the movie about other than giant explosions and driving across the desert??? The movie wasn't a total bust, though. The acting was good and I got a kick out of the guy playing the guitar.",NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2015","As a straight action movie, it's one of the best I can think of and stands as an achievement for its genre. It's refreshingly inventive in the visuals and in the atmosphere, and the story is original, though not the strongest part of the film. Mad Max sticks to the action, veering only sometimes outside of that for appropriate stake building, and this leads to a film that's great action even if it's still not a great movie.

Max gets a short introduction in the beginning of the film before it jumps directly, and while the film jumps right into the action. Here, the film wants to ditch the slow start up that action films often have, and I admire that it wants to do that. However, it does it a little too quickly. Stakes are built not too far later on, and I was reminded of how action is more engaging when those stakes are there. Still, the stakeless opening 20 minutes of this film does have a visually spectacular sandstorm that's one of the most exciting moments in the film. 

The world that the film creates is what helps it feel fresh and original. The desert post-apocalyptic insanity is not something that we've seen before, and Mad Max takes great advantage of its world. Much of the world building is implied through the characters, actions, and sets rather than told in useless exposition. Because of Miller's full realization of this world, we get seemingly endless inventiveness in what happens during the action. For a movie that's 75% action, there is hardly any repetition. People are fighting and encountering obstacles in new ways all of the time. 

Also fun to watch are the vehicles, which are rusty and hand-made with neat functions and designs. There is a ton of detail on them, with curled-up ropes, cranks, and pipes that each function as a part of some contraption or defense that we might not even see used during the film. It's this level of detail, which is present throughout the film, that makes us feel like the world was there long before we witnessed it.

The visual design of the film is spectacular, with computer effects and digital colors beautifully enhancing the film in a way that feels very modern and that represents the best of what technology can do for films, and shows the world what it can do for an action film. But this is not a CGI loaded movie. A ton of practical effects are used with the car chases, crashes, and stunts all feeling very authentic. It's impressive when thinking about how difficult the film must have been to create, but that level of ambition has certainly payed off. 

Miller's directorial style includes a frantic camera that films from a variety of angles, tight and wide, and is always on the move. With the editing, these are stitched together to create action sequences that are coherent and fast paced. The use of fast and slow motion is notable because it feels like it really fits. Something about the film feels B-movie and 80's, and yet there's so much of the film that feels so modern. It's a winning combination. 

So the action in the film is pretty much perfect, but an action film can't only be action because there's a story. And to not the least of my expectations, the story doesn't live up to the greatness of the action.

One thing that bothered me was the lack of attention to Max's character. Max sees flashes of flashbacks in the movie because he's haunted by people he couldn't save. I was pretty sure that this was the filmmaker telling the audience that we would find out what's going on with his past and then have him overcome it, but nope. These were totally abandoned by the end of the film. He overcomes nothing and seems to learn nothing during the film, and neither does Furiosa. The movie gets about as deep as the word ""hope"" itself. There wasn't really much heart to it either, and the most emotion in this film is badassery and I don't consider that an emotion of value. 

So it's great for action and if all you want out of a movie is action then you'll get your share. I found the film to be original, inventive, and an achievement in its genre, even if I wouldn't call it great overall.",NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2015","Whilst you cannot deny the thrilling nature of the action and the extremely well-coreographed fight scenes, I was waiting for something that never seemed to appear, and that was the personality of Max. I am surprised to say that I think Hardy was miscast, not least as I was anticipating him being ideal for the role. He is of course very physical and has huge presence, but he just did not have the charisma and personality of Gibson's Max. He seemed unable to decide on exactly what accent and tone of voice to choose too. I also found myself cringing slightly at times, as the overblown antics of the various lunatics on screen just seemed too forced and too 'throw anything at it, no matter how ridiculous'. I never found this with the original films and I think, for some reason, this version just did not draw me into its weird world in the same way. I just could not suspend disbelief. Comparisons are odious and I set out prepared to treat this as its own film but, throughout, I kept thinking to myself that I could have been sat at home, watching the old films on Blu-ray. Too much self-conscious nonsense and not enough narrative for me. I caught the distinct whiff of arrogance in what seemed to be an assumption that CGI and undeniably clever photography will inevitably lead to a better film that the original.",NEUTRAL
"May 25, 2015","Intense, visceral, perverse, brutal, exhilarating - Mad Max: Fury Road is all of these and much more!

A simple storyline without any frills or back-story, the movie grabs you right from the start and doesn't let go. Set in a dystopian future, where wars are being fought over water, the movie follows Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) as she attempts to escape from the clutches of the despotic Immortan Joe (Hugh Keys-Byrnes), taking his harem along with her. Of course, Immortan finds out, and proceeds to unleash an all-out pursuit of Furiosa and his harem of Five Wives. 

So where does Mad Max come in, you may ask? Well, the fact is that the titular Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) actually plays second fiddle in this movie; it must have taken Hardy a certain amount of courage to play an iconic role that ends up being secondary to that of the female protagonist. The movie has a strong, yet non-strident feminist tone that does not detract from the rest of the action, and seems like a very natural extension of it. 

The movie opens with a high-octane chase when Immortan Joe's War Boys take Max captive in the Citadel. On finding out that he is a universal blood donor, they hook him up as a blood bag to Nux (Nicholas Hoult) a War Boy afflicted by tumors and therefore running on ""half-life"". Max, still hooked up, is taken along in pursuit of Furiosa, during which he is able to escape. Antagonists at first, Furiosa and Max become allies in their quest for the Green Place, her homeland. 

Every high-intensity chase sequence is immediately followed by a higher-intensity one. Every time you think that it can't get any better, it does. Every time you feel that you can now start breathing, something else comes along to knock the breath out of your lungs! The best part is that there is no shaky-cam or in-your- face-cam, which is what passes for action nowadays. The action sequences actually seem credible and effectively tread the fine line between glorious spectacle and complete insanity. There's actually a pretty good reason for this - it seems that the use of CGI was kept to a minimum, and stuntmen were used as far as possible. 

The movie is not just high-octane action and incredible pursuit vehicles; the themes of freedom, sacrifice and redemption form a strong emotional core for the movie. Stellar performances from Theron, Hardy and Hoult elevate this to much more than a mindless action flick. Hardy's monosyllabic Max is tortured by a past he cannot forget, while Theron is splendid as Furiosa, willing to kill (and die) for a childhood utopia she can barely remember. Hoult is unexpectedly able as Nux, in a role that calls for equal amounts of viciousness and tenderness. No matter how high your expectations are, believe me, this movie will meet them all, and then some!

A remake?/sequel? that really, really goes for it full force in the face and in doing so largely impresses, yet doesn't quite take the crown of the very best of the series which is, and probably always will be, Mad Max 2. Tom Hardy fills the role that Mel left behind in the mid eighties, though this time Max hardly has more than a few lines of dialogue in the entire film, but then he was never a big talker, with a bulk of the attention and lines left for solely Charlize Theron's character. This is a visually epic looking film with TONS of loud, fast well shot action, though I missed the more subtle elements of the other instalments that this doesn't have as much of. Plot wise this is a near remake of beyond thunderdome with a few different ideas running through, some of them good, some not so great. In terms of all-out action this is a must watch. It's hugely entertaining and very well made, it's also worthy of the Mad Max name, which is probably its biggest accomplishment.",NEUTRAL

The Action: 
What critics are lauding as great at-the-edge-of-your-seat type of action turns out to be extremely boring and filled with gimmicks and dystopic chase clichés. After the first 15 minutes, it'll feel like you're watching the same 15 minutes on repeat until the movie ends.

The context under which I saw ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was not one I prefer when watching any movie, namely that I already knew about its high critical and audience reception (I suppose that's a risk you run when seeing a movie a week after it opens). Naturally, this raised my own expectations for the film and I'm admittedly impressionable, so part of me feared I would simply praise and like it by default just because the majority already had, which would make my own review rather hollow.

Luckily, though, I think my being so overtly aware of my circumstances allowed me to subdue my pre-conceived judgments and go into the movie with as clear and open a mind as possible, which wasn't easy but I believe I managed. And so, it is my true and honest opinion that this latest installment of the nearly 40-year-old ""Mad Max"" franchise, and the first one to surface in 30 years, is, indeed, a very good action picture, superbly crafted, visually ambitious and all around entertaining. I wouldn't go so far as to say the entire production approaches greatness, but it certainly possesses great elements.

Like its predecessors, the story takes place in a grim and unattractive future, one in which the world has become an arid, dry and barren wasteland. The original ""Mad Max"" (1979) practically pioneered this cinematic setting, which so many other post-apocalyptic action-adventure tales have tried to emulate and/or build upon. As far as the eye can see, there is only dirt, dust, rock, and leaf-less trees, prompting inhabitants of this fruitless and depressing dystopia to ask, ""Who killed the world?"" 

There's no clear answer to that question, but plenty of people are still killing each other as the population has been reduced to a single instinct: survival. Water has become the most sough-after and precious commodity on the planet and different factions have formed to seize and control its sources. One of the current dominating cults is headed by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a grotesque and tyrannical albino with flowing white hair who requires a special mask to breathe (not unlike Bane's from ""The Dark Knight Rises""). He commands an army of white-skinned and nutrient-deficient War Boys, whom he's promised entry into Valhalla if they serve him. As the movie opens, the War Boys capture ""Mad"" Max Rockatanksy (Tom Hardy), the former cop still haunted by the murder of his family (he tells us he's the type of man who runs from both the living and the dead). They enslave Max because he's a viable source of blood.

Although the film is titled, ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" Max himself is somewhat of a supporting character this time around, which was refreshingly unexpected. The more central protagonist is actually a heroine named Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a supposed loyalist to Joe, but as the plot gets under way, Furiosa leads a caravan of War Boys into a rival gang's territory. She hides in her giant rig five of Joe's wives, each of whom only exists to bear his offspring. Furiosa, a warrior and expert assassin, has rescued these women from Joe's clutches in hopes they can all return to Furiosa's home called the ""Green Place."" Joe and his thugs, of course, become privy to Furiosa's traitorous intentions and the movie eventually settles down as a two-hour road battle between the two groups, replete with various vehicle chases, shoot-outs, and a whole lot of death-defying stunts. Max finds himself stuck in the middle but his lingering humanity eventually convinces him to aid Furiosa and the women.

We've seen a lot of what ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" has to offer several times before, and not just from countless other action movies, but all throughout the ""Mad Max"" series itself. Content-wise, there's nothing terribly new or original here, and while the movie may be light on plot and character development, it's rich in theme and atmosphere. Director George Miller, who helmed all the previous installments, and his team of artists prove they are masters of their cinematic resources. The visual and sound designs, along with the editing, fully immerse us in this world, no matter how dark, dreary and unpleasant it may be. We walk away thinking we've seen something unique, which is a hard task these days, especially for the action genre.

The movie's stunts are also impressive, not to mention convincing, because they seem to have been performed mostly with practical effects instead of CGI and on actual locations instead of against a green screen. I was particularly struck by a sequence that finds Max dangling from a crane that's swinging back and forth as his vehicle speeds down the open desert landscape. It was a truly awesome feat to watch and ""Fury Road"" has more than its fair share of such moments.

Given the consistent quality and financial success of the original ""Mad Max"" trilogy, we may wonder why it took Miller so long to make a fourth movie. Reportedly, ""Fury Road"" was stuck in ""development hell"" for years, but whatever the reason, it was worth the wait. The movie is up there with ""Furious 7"" as far as delivering an exciting rush. 

With that said, if Miller is planning a fifth installment, I do hope he makes it more character and story-driven. We've seen he and his team can do action, but I'd like the series to tackle its narrative themes on a deeper and more substantive level, especially since they've given themselves so much to explore. That's not to say, however, it shouldn't still contain a heavy metal band rocking out on the front of a big rig as violence and mayhem take place around them. That happens in ""Fury Road,"" and really, in what other franchise would such a scene feel so appropriate?",NEUTRAL

"May 24, 2015","Relentless is the word I would use to describe Mad Max. Having not seen the earlier editions of this franchise, I only went in to watch this for two reasons. Tom Hardy and surprisingly good critic reviews. If trailers are the yardstick to judge a film, I confess I was just freaked out with this film's trailer. Mad Max is set in a post-apocalypse fictional world where the basic amenities are Water, Oil and Bullets rather than food, shelter and clothes. Then we have Max our chief protagonist with a murky past being slung along by a gang of maniacal men (if only you could call them one) in one hell of a chase across the desert. Though Tom Hardy was my initial interest to watch this film, the film is literally OWNED by Charlize Theron who even in this age past her prime shines as Imperator Furiosa seeking redemption from the world that is around her. On the surface it may look like just a crazy film, Mad Max is actually several layers deep and even amidst all the lunacy in its characters we find some great emotional depth. Needless to say, the action sequences are mindblowing with some really good use of 3D. George Miller adds detail and vibrance in the bleak arid landscape with some really gorgeous set pieces that will draw a wow from cinema connoiseurs. Where Mad Max lacks a bit is the surprisingly little back story behind all the ruckus happening on screen and that dulls the way one feels for the characters. Perhaps in sequels this would be much clearer. It is definitely worth a watch in Imax and especially watch out for the guitar shredder in between the dollops of action pouring out from the screen!!",NEUTRAL

"May 23, 2015","What I also love about this movie is that the lead character is a woman. Hollywood these days are always depicting women who need a man take care of them. That they can't live without men. That is DEFINITELY not the case with this movie. Furiosa is fierce, she's skilled, she's unpredictable and she's all out bad ass. This is a testosterone filled movie but it's not the testosterone that takes charge.

Action movies these days aren't normally as good as one of the reasons being is that the hero is never really in any really danger. If he's never in danger or near death how can you possible expect to have your audience on the edge of their seats. Pondering what if the inevitable happened. Max was in peril SO MANY TIMES in this film. There was at least 10 times where I thought ""this is the end, he's going to die"" then he miraculously gets out of it. But it's not the cliché type when someone luckily comes along at the last moment and saves him. Believe me there aren't many, if any clichés in this movie. He fights his way out of these death defying situations. Furiosa out other lead is also in life threatening situations throughout this movie. Many times where we wouldn't know if she would make it.

"May 23, 2015","All the glowing reviews this movie has been getting are well deserved.

The film is very simple, very minimalist in its dialogue, and it's still one of the most thrilling action movies you'll see.

The plot? Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) kidnaps some women from a dictator who is trying to get them back. Pretty straightforward. Oh, and Mad Max gets involved, too. Yay.

The film feels like one giant action sequence with a few brief moments to catch our breath while the next chase is set up. All of the action is so well done, so well edited, that the fact the movie is one giant chase scene does not cause the film to drag, feel too long, or feel too dull.

If there's one problem with the film, it's with our title hero. He kinda gets the shaft as the ladies are front and center in this one. Nothing wrong with giving the women more to do, especially in films like this, but at the cost of making the title character an afterthought in his own movie? Uh... no.

Still, it's great, it's fun, it's completely insane, and it's probably one of the best made action movies you'll see.",NEUTRAL
"May 23, 2015","No plot and no character development at all. They left way to many holes in the end that left you with more questions than answers. I left no really knowing anything about the two main characters. For goodness sakes, you don't event actually see Max (no including intro) talking to someone until like 30-45mins in the movie. The only reason why I even gave something above 1 star is because of the great action scenes. I am one action junkie but you need something besides a big car chase to keep me intrigued.",NEUTRAL
"May 23, 2015","So I'm not quite sure what I saw.... it was ridiculous actually but completely entertaining.

Very very entertaining. .. and very very mad indeed.",NEUTRAL

"May 23, 2015","I gave this movie 2 stars only because the production value and fight/chase scenes were well done.  But this wasn't a movie.  It was a chance to pay for a monster truck race.

I'm a huge Mad Max fan.  I loved the first one and The Road Warrior is one of my all-time favorites (but let's be honest, Thunderdome sucked).  I'm also a huge Tom Hardy fan.  So this movie should have been great...right?

The problem is that there was virtually no dialog or story.  In fact, let me sum up the entire movie for you (spoilers ahead):

- Max is captured
- The bad guys send Charlize Theron out to get gas/bullets
- She turns left
- All hell breaks loose and everyone starts chasing her
- Max gets loose and helps her turn left
- She escapes and gets where she's going
- She realizes it isn't what she hoped
- They go back
- Everyone tries to kill them
- They return
- Movie ends

Honestly, if you're looking for...well, a story or some dialog or maybe just...well anything but chases and explosions...forget it.

Yes there were good explosions.  Yes there were intense fight scenes.  But I can get that watching cage fighting matches and monster truck rallies.  I wanted more.  I wanted a story.  Any story would have sufficed.

Sadly this movie was so poorly conceived that all Tom Hardy got to do was grunt, steer and occasionally shoot at someone.

Terrible move.  Truly terrible.",NEUTRAL
"May 23, 2015","'Mad' is the correct word. Only way to describe just how impressive the visuals are, how energetic the tone is, how engaging the post-apocalyptic atmosphere is and how wonderfully inventive the action sequences are (I say sequences but the movie is basically one long action sequence). Imagine the ps3 game Motor-storm with weapons and you're not far off. Not since 'Inception' have my expectations been so high going in so it shows a lot that it satisfied them. It's just a shame I couldn't give a 5 star. This is because of the lack of characterisation which would have added deeper significance to the on-screen carnage. Unlike many action films, I like the premise and it does provide all the important elements but I felt particularly little more time with Mad Max's history and the villain was needed. Perhaps harsh since 'Mad Max: Fury Road's biggest appeal is that it is pretty much all action while there is also a fine-line before it heads into excessive storytelling. This is why it remains a small personal criticism and one which should not stop you from rushing into the cinema at the next available opportunity to experience the madness.",NEUTRAL

El error que nunca le voy a perdonar a Miller es porque si tenemos todo bien la historia tenia que ser burda. ¿Tanto relajo por unas putas?

Tom Hardy pasa a segundo plano y las verdaderas estrellas de la pelicula son Charlize Theron y Nicholas Hoult que entregan actuaciones de primer nivel.

"May 23, 2015","Look, if you are expecting Mad Max: Fury Road to be just a carbon copy of the original The Road Warrior, you are going to be both surprised . . . and not surprised. Yes, Mad Max: Fury Road is exactly like every Mad movie you have seen  . . . and also totally different. Confused? Join the club. I'll admit that it took me a few minutes to realize that the title character, Mad Max, wasn't the lead or the focus of this movie. He is supporting character, a utilitarian character, a character not unlike The Feral Kid in Mad Max 2. 

The real Mad Max character in this movie is a female character named Imperator Furiosa who rose from her slavery to become a general in Immortan Joe's kick-booty army of paint huffing War Boys. And what does she do? Well, as soon as she gets her War Rig,  and the opportunity, she snags Joe's wives and hightails it to some feminist fantasy land called the Green Place.

And yes, this movie is full of ""feminist propaganda!"" How do I know? Well, the director says so, the author of the script says so, and if that's not enough proof for you, they cast a woman in the lead role. So, ergo: it's feminist propaganda. I mean, that's the way we all American, eat all you want, heterosexual white dudes think, right? Woman in lead role = feminist propaganda. Never mind the that if the lead role had been cast as a white male we'd all be thinking that it was a brilliant movie about "". . . the MANly spirit standing proudly up for ""HIS"" rights against the evil powers of a totalitarian regime-

Oh, yeah, the movie. The movie's great, man. Just the cinematography alone is worth the price of admission (Which if you go to a matinée showing like I do, it ain't that much). The shots of the Namib Desert are just devastatingly beautiful. The pic above this review is a still from the movie. And forget about any action sequences you've seen in the past. The chase scenes across the desert are brilliant! New camera techniques, incredible car crashes, great, extremely great stunt work make this ""sequel"" the best movie of the Mad Max franchise. Okay, I do admit I STILL don't like the way the shoot hand-to-hand combat scenes these days. They speed up the camera to make the fight seem more ""powerful(?)"" and to also cover-up the fact that the lead actors can't do stunt work. It makes it all look a bit herky-jerky. Anyway, no matter what of you love great action, exceptional acting and storytelling, Mad Max: Fury Road is a must see! ""Oh what a day, what a lovely day!""",NEUTRAL

"May 23, 2015","Admittedly when I stood up at the end of the film and claimed to my friends that it was the single worst film I had ever seen in my life, that statement was an exaggeration. However, I stand by the fact that it was the least enjoyable viewing experience I have ever had in a cinema.

     After seeing the trailer one week earlier, it was generally agreed within my friendship group that the film looked pretty diabolical in terms of plot development - what could possibly be that interesting in a film that the majority of the plot is filmed driving through a dessert with minimal dialogue? Nonetheless, after being told earlier in the day before viewing the film that it had been rated 8.8 on IMDb, I consciously made the effort to not judge the film by the trailer and I assumed that I was going to the cinema to enjoy watching a critically acclaimed film. In hindsight, I should have remembered from previous experiences that as soon as friends of mine see that a film is critically acclaimed, they generally enjoy the film. I on the other hand, am not a film snob. If I don't enjoy a film I'm not going to say I like it (or search for reasons that credit the film) just because it is well reviewed. But don't get me wrong, some of my favourite films are well reviewed films and here is just to list a few: Shawshank Redemption, Batman Dark Night Rises, Pulp Fiction, Inception and The Matrix (the first one).

     I will now go on to discuss the reasons as to why I did not enjoy Mad Max: Fury Road. Emphasis on the 'I' did not enjoy this film and I'm not going to try and dictate to other people how they should perceive the enjoyment factor of the film. Firstly, it is apparent that the film is completely impractical in the sense that it misses out on many basic aspects of what constitutes an enjoyable movie. For example, the film starts mid-plot and therefore requires the viewer to 'fill in the blanks' at the start. Long introductions can be unnecessary but I personally feel a brief introduction as to how the protagonist ended up where they are is always needed - particularly when the whole film is based in a fucking desert. Additionally the film has a weak plot and as evidence of this I can summarise the plot in one sentence - Nuclear disaster wipes out a huge chunk of the Earth, evil guy controls the only decent part of the Earth left, the 'goodies' go on a journey to try and find some other decent land, they can't find any so they kill the evil guy and live happily ever after. In addition to all this, unrealistic damage is inflicted on objects/humans by intense explosions throughout the film - when I see a car explode, I expect the person inside it to either die or suffer third degree burns. Finally, as mentioned previously the film has the most primitive ending possible - bad guy dies, the oppressed overthrow the system and live happily ever after.

     On another note, what the hell is that mug doing playing a guitar on the front of the truck (see photo). Is there supposed to be some sort of symbolism behind this or is it actually just random. Moreover, the flames coming out the end of the guitar look more fake than a Rolex in Thailand. Some of the CGI in the film is incredible and it is commendable that the film crew spent 6 months filming in the desert. Howbeit, this isn't a precedent for a good film and it does not in itself make a film enjoyable in my opinion.
     After focussing on the negatives of the film (I only included a few), I will move on to discussing the positive aspects of the film. Notwithstanding, I will remain critical of the positive aspects because let's face it, I dislike the film. Essentially, the use of colour throughout the film was incredible - my eyes needed some serious adjusting upon leaving cinema. This includes (but was not limited to) the different coloured powder flairs, dusty explosion scenes in the desert and the exploding vehicles in general. In addition, the use of women as a main rebel group was particularly powerful and challenged the classic stereotype of the male hero. In spite of this, why did Millar believe it was necessary to employ the use of 'grannys on motorbikes'? If I wanted to see cringe worthy scenes like that I'd have watched Avengers 2 (saw that one week earlier). Ultimately, the acting from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron was impeccable, but this did not make up for all the other reasons as to why I was not taking pleasure in watching the film.

     To conclude, I appreciate there are people who would have picked up on more of the devices and subplots than I did (I'm not a film connoisseur). On the other hand, people should appreciate that the film is not to everyone's taste. I reiterate - just because it is well reviewed it doesn't mean you have to like the film or else 'you're an ignorant idiot'. Also, I don't go looking for reasons to put down well-reviewed films - I just didn't like Mad Max. The aim of this review isn't to deter people from watching the film. If anything watch it twice and then make up your mind. And I'm not saying people shouldn't enjoy the film. My point is that people should appreciate that it's a specific genre and not to everyone's taste. For a film that cost me £8.80 and a car journey to go and watch, I spent most of the film wondering whether I would watch the film again even if someone paid me to.",NEUTRAL

"May 23, 2015","One of the best action movies I've seen in over a decade.  George Miller comes back in roaring fashion to create a bombastic, visceral, and explosive masterpiece.  It's really refreshing to see a movie that doesn't rely solely on CGI to establish stakes and the set pieces are set up exquisitely.  The film also does a great job of forming the characters without much dialogue.  Charlize Theron is great as Imperator Furiosa and Tom Hardy adds a lot to the movie despite having 10 lines at the most.  Make no mistake though; this is a female-centric narrative that hits everything you want it to in the most outlandish of fashions.  A must-see.",NEUTRAL

"May 22, 2015","Every so often there comes a film that challenges perceptions and alters the genre of which it sits. That happened 34 years ago when Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior came out and influenced the entire post-apocalyptic genre for decades. Director George Miller is a visionary in every way which made it perplexing that a quasi-remake/sequel would be made on the heavily influential films as many of them fall by the wayside to cliché special effects, PG-13 ratings which hinder the violence and mayhem and an abundance of doing the same thing as before. But all of that would be washed away the instant the credits roll on Mad Max: Fury Road as it's at times nothing like the original trilogy but in other ways very much like it. Fury Road is dazzling in its portrayal of a lawless world while beautiful in its inert unpredictable chaos. Nothing is what you expected and it never leaves you hanging as it forcibly pushes its foot on the pedal going gleefully straight into the heart of madness.

""Mad"" Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is a tortured loner who is grieving the death of his wife and child at the hands of ruthless marauders. He travels the desolate Australian landscape by his lonesome, only looking out for himself while trying to overcome his nightmarish visions of his dead family. Before then he gets targeted by a maniacal and crazed army of mechanics called War Boys including Nux (Nicholas Hoult) under the order of despotic ruler Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Joe runs rough shod over the Citadel which is one of the last vestiges of a society where he cruelly holds back water to the destitute below him. To further influence his power over the land, he has Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) attain gas and ammunition from neighboring towns but finds that she has stolen a harem from him. Commandeering a souped-up semi, she travels the desolate landscape in search of hope and redemption. But along the way she meets up with Max and they both have to trust each other to escape the tyrannical rule of Joe and his ruthless followers.

To begin with, one does not need to see the previous Mad Max films to appreciate Fury Road but it would be helpful to see the older films and get a feeling of where Miller originally began with this character. Not to mention that they are amazing and cult classics. There were simply too many facets of this film that I love that a second viewing is basically mandatory. But the design of everything stood out as it's instantly eye grabbing. It's impossible to watch it and not be wowed with amazement at every minute detail that went into creating this gorgeous and brutal world. It really went out of its way to show you something different and make sure that it stays with you long after the credits roll. The Citadel looked amazing and was a perfect enclosure for a man to rule over people who are weaker than him. It's one of the most all-encompassing post-apocalyptic visions I have ever seen as so many things get covered throughout the film. You see how water is dispersed, women are made to breed, crops are grown and automobiles are made to look like it came out of Satan's personal garage. It sets the bar incredibly high for design and it wouldn't be too crazy to see Fury Road be nominated for best production design at next year's Oscars. Maybe makeup too as it added another dimension to the characters and setting. Nearly everyone is stamped with a tattoo, marking or tag as everyone looks like they came out of Burning Man. The tattoos are somewhat like Native American cultures among many others where they become part of the history and growing up.

It only makes sense that the man who innovated the genre with Mad Max would do so again with Fury Road showing that sometimes it takes the same man to outdo himself. The automobiles looked something out of Odd Rods as everything looked downright menacing as well as cartoonish. Nothing here would be presented in the actual world in any way but looking at it onscreen, you wish you had one as your own to terrify other motorists on the road. The thought it took to create them is astounding as it looks like grown adults reverted back to their inner child and cooked up anything at all that looked cool and downright insane. No regular person can think of this stuff as it takes a special person with a deep imagination for the bizarre.
The War Rig driven by Furiosa could not look any cooler and is like a revamped truck from The Road Warrior. Joe's Gigahorse is completely menacing with the monster truck tires and the melding of two Cadillac Coupe de Ville's on its body. The moving concert stage or The Doof Wagon is unlike anything that I have ever seen. It just defies logic and understanding and could not be more perfect for this post-apocalyptic wasteland. And of course one of the greatest automobiles in cinematic history, The Interceptor makes its valiant return after not being seen in Beyond Thunderdome. It looks just as awesome as it did 34 years ago, giving me all the feels in the right places. The cinematography by John Seale made this bizarre circus freak show amazingly beautiful in so many ways. You get a distinct feel for the sand and sun drenched, lifeless, barren environment and the scope of Joe's massive psychopathic army.

Everything pops when you look at the screen and it sometimes makes it hard to follow with so much mayhem but that's half the fun. You're not meant to take in everything the first time upon viewing. With so many details on screen, you're allowed to see every bit of them as nothing gets lost on screen. it's one of the best visual cinematic experiences I have ever had as every shot looks like art, in the same realm as Stanley Kubrick many visual masterpieces. The editing by Margaret Sixel was quick and frantic but not confusing in a way where you don't know where the action is going. You're able to follow every punch, gunshot, crash and other various acts of mayhem very fluidly. The use of slo-mo which can be used in a cheesy way were used perfectly here. With so many catastrophes going on all the time, it needs some slow motion added for the most visual pleasing effect possible. It makes seeing every bit and piece of a car shattering into pieces and bodies falling by the wayside that much more pleasurable.

The soundtrack by Junkie XL is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. Its pulsating drums, sweeping strings and manic electric guitars create a whirlwind of symphonic chaos as well as quiet sentimentality. Every track feels powerful and important while making you feel you could go a little mad with The War Boys for a bit. As I am listening to the soundtrack right now, it makes writing this all the more easier. There is a distinct influence of Hans Zimmer who may be the best film composer living today. I really haven't heard a score as Fury Road since Man Of Steel which coincidentally was scored by Zimmer and was worked on by Junkie XL. Junkie XL also worked on the equally mesmerizing soundtrack to The Dark Knight Rises as the influence is very palpable here. Escape and Brothers In Arms are some of the very best tracks. The soundtrack should have been nothing short of brilliant since the soundtrack for The Road Warrior by Brian May was one of the best action soundtracks ever.

For a man whose 70 years old, George Miller certainly doesn't look it or act like it. He attacks the screen better than many directors over half his age and then some. There's a tenacity that is really sorely missing from today's field of blockbusters and it's as if it's a direct challenge to the biggest directors in the world today. It feels like Miller is saying ""Are you not entertained?"" to the Michael Bays of the world. Much like Martin Scorsese with The Wolf Of Wall Street who was 70 while filming this movie, Miller hasn't slowed an inch and shows that he is even more insane than before. He wants you to see, hear, feel and think of everything around you and keep you entrenched in the world for two hours. I also liked how he handled the radiation from the nuclear fallout and many people being disfigured or near death because of it. It adds to the hectic environment where many don't have much to lose and much to gain in Valhalla. Being that he has been out of the action game as well as post-apocalyptic Australian for decades, you could feel that he was having the time of his life filming Fury Road as if he never left.

He is daring and dangerous who's willing to put the actors and stuntmen through the physical and mental ringer to get the perfect shot which makes it terrifying and exciting on what ideas he has for future sequels. The manic, quick, fast paced close-ups have become a staple of the Mad Max films and they are all over the place here. It's one of the great pleasures of watching this film, seeing everything go quick and crazy then you see the aftermath of the chaos in slow motion. He knows how to create intriguing new characters with a semblance of humanity, trying to hold on to ones sanity or just outright viciousness. For all the non-stop action, it's paced extremely well giving one the perfect amount of time to breathe and recollect ones bearings. Miller knows better than anyone on how to construct an action sequence and showing something that no one has ever seen before. The Road Warrior's climatic action sequence near the end is one of the best chase scenes/action sequences ever filmed bar none and even today can still go toe to toe with any action sequence from any of the Fast And Furious films.

This makes it hard to choose a favorite action sequence in Fury Road since its basically one long massive chase scene. It's the final chase scene in Road Warrior but extended to two hours. I would have to say the final chase scene is the best one since it encapsulates so many things at once like any climax should. If Fury Road was a benchmark for action films, what would the next film look like? Miller seems to come in at the right times and show everyone how it's done. With blockbusters the way they are now with a superfluous amount of special effects and a hindrance to a certain type of order, it can get a little tiring after a while. So seeing a film that throws basically every rule out the window is one of the most refreshing experiences one can ever witness. Many of his influences like James Cameron seem to have gone backwards from his more subtle practical effects background where he instead tries to reinvent the wheel again and again with the most realistic special effects ever seen. But it's just nice to see things reverted back a bit where everything wasn't done on screen. It's revealing to get down to the nitty gritty.

That's why it's nice to see an action film with as limited special effects as humanely possible while still being incredibly exciting. Furious 7 was a fun ride and I really enjoyed it and all but it became quite forgettable once the dust had cleared. Avengers: Age Of Ultron falls in that same category but not as much as Furious 7. Never have I seen stunts so out of this world and something one would see in a cartoon. The amount of pressure and danger to pull these stunts off is nothing short of extraordinary. I think this may be the most outlandish use of practical effects for any film ever. It seems hard to top but if anyone can its George Miller. I could not have been any more excited for Ultron but Fury Road was the main course for me. It just offered so much more for me while still being fresh in many ways. The only other film that got me more excited this year than Fury Road is Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens which no doubt will be amazing.

Miller wrote the script with interestingly enough the help of an unlikely pair that don't have any success with screenwriting. Brendan McCarthy is a comic book designer with works in TV and film who incidentally was influenced by The Road Warrior for a comic book while Nico Lathouris is an often unseen character actor who was in the original Mad Max as a mechanic. Together they craft an intimate, humane and rollicking action film that is often tender at the right moments while sporting mesmerizing set pieces. Its way more intimate than most action films while challenging the view of women in the action genre. The battle cry of one of the escaping breeders saying ""We are not things!"" is basically a big FU to every director, producer and screenwriter who demoralizes women on screen, using them for overt sexual purposes, weak underdeveloped characters and helpless damsels in distress. It's a theme that is ever-present throughout the film while not being the single main attraction of the entire movie. It's one of the strongest films to ever approach equality in a concise manner where Miller doesn't beat you over the head to make you understand. Men aren't evil but the plights of world destruction usually begin with a man who could not care less as many of them are in powerful positions. It doesn't make them bad but infallible.

Max doesn't have much to say but when has he ever had much to say. He doesn't speak because he wants to; he only speaks because he has to. He has always been a silent, animalistic brute who speaks when it's most important. Max hardly speaks in The Road Warrior and it hardly matters since he is a man of action. I think the Gyro Captain even spoke more than him. So it clearly didn't bother me at all that he didn't speak much in Fury Road. It's the quiet moments that hold the most power as we hear Furiosa's story and her mission towards redemption and safe haven or Nux becoming disillusioned in his place among The War Boys and his rightful ascension into Valhalla. It's not as if Max is suddenly going to open up about his dead family since he has never done that before previously. Max doesn't need to tell and no one knows why Max is so mad and he wouldn't have it any other way. He did punch Pappagallo in the face for outright demanding what was wrong with him in Road Warrior. It's the mystery of his character to everyone else as well as the audience that makes him so intriguing. As well as seeing him move on from a loner to an important cog in Furiosa's mission for redemption and hope. He will never be outright good or bad but even teetering on the brink makes him more relatable than most action heroes. Nux is an incredibly complex character that brings a needed dimension to the Mad Max filmography. You get deep down to how The War Boys think and how easy it is for them to be depressed. It's hard to find another oddly intriguing character in any movie.

The story is as simple as the previous Mad Max films and doesn't need to be wrought with swerves, double crosses, intrigue and twists to be exciting or innovative like many blockbuster films. Max Rockatansky is basically just trying to move on with his life by his lonesome for the most part but gets caught up with violence and mayhem. Max tried to do that in Mad Max and start a new life with his family while holding on to his sanity but they got hunted by a vicious biker gang, leaving them murdered. In The Road Warrior, Max just wanted some fuel and supplies but gets caught up with the plight of a community of survivors holding gasoline while battling vicious marauders. In Beyond Thunderdome, he just wants his camels and supplies that were stolen from him but gets caught up in getting a tribe of kids to a safe point in the city. In Fury Road, Max just wants to be left alone after being hunted down while leaving anyone else in the dust but gets caught up in helping others to safety. The stories of the Mad Max films are paint by numbers sometimes but it doesn't make them any less exciting. It's the simplicity that makes them so enjoyable and sets them apart from their blockbuster counterparts.

Fury Road starts off guns blazing and ends with enough ammo to spare. The fact that its one long chase scene makes it quite an anomaly since it's so simple. One would expect something more but it has more than enough to keep anyone satisfied. Furiosa does hold the screen for a lot of the film but that is no way a slight as it mixes up the films a bit. The movies are about Max but it's also about the people he encounters along the way. The last two Mad Max films have a narrator that help to move along the legend of Mad Max and without them the movies would be nothing. Max moves in and out like a ghost or a distant, faded memory and doesn't need to have the spotlight on him the entire time. He's one of the very few action characters that is sometimes in the background and isn't really forced upon you. Max is a strong enough character by himself which always makes the surrounding characters that much more intriguing. Here Max isn't that much different but he is still able to command a screen even if it's not played by Mel Gibson.
Immortan Joe looks something out of Darth Vader with his pale scarred skin, middle aged body, breathing face mask with altered voice and battle armor adorned over his chest. His raccoon, steely, striking eyes instantly strike fear into his enemies and his imposing garb makes for a very intimidating character. He made for a great menacing villain that goes through some surprising character revelations which doesn't make him any less endearing but still all the more effective.

One of the many things I loved during Fury Road was the names for all the characters as they all became instantly memorable and right on par with The Humungus, Toadie, Wez, The Toecutter and The Nightrider. It's hard not to love names like The People Eater, The Bullet Farmer, The Organic Mechanic, The Splendid Angharad, Capable, Toast the Knowing, The Dag, Cheedo the Fragile, Coma (Doof Warrior) and quite possibly the greatest name to ever be uttered on film or in the history of time by anyone dead or living, past, present or future, Rictus Erectus. Maybe the coolest character to never utter a single word in any movie ever may be the epic, heavy metal, axe slaying, flame throwing guitarist Coma who provides the battle ground with epic metal riffs to swiftly aid the War Boys in combat. I couldn't help but smile and marvel every time I see him since it's so illogical in any setting, real or fictional to have a truck full of massive speakers, War Boys pounding on huge drums and a masked man wield a guitar/flame thrower. Nothing about it makes any sense but that's also why it worked so well and why I want one so very bad.

In the past, there have been many iconic female characters that rival any man when it comes to being a complete and utter badass. Furiosa ranks among the class of Ripley, Sarah Connor, Trinity, and The Bride among others as a classic female action character. She is strong, driven, can throw a mean punch despite not having a fist attached to an arm and willing to put everything on the line. She's also a crack shot with a rifle, often hitting her target with only one shot. She performs a much needed kill shot when Max was missing but it wasn't portrayed as one being emasculated or made to feel less than but the other person being the better shot. Furiosa takes no crap from anyone and will do everything in her power to make you realize that. Even though she doesn't have a left arm, you're not meant to feel sorry for her and she doesn't elicit sympathy because of it. Here she is just as capable of firing guns, driving a rig and punching someone out as someone with two fully functioning arms. Not to mention she just looks so much cooler with a mechanical arm. The women she saves also have strong personalities which the film does much to separate them with individual identities and not have them be helpless or overtly weak. They were made to be weak and served as they don't often see the plight of the survivors below. Of course they were attractive as anyone who breeds animals would want the most pleasing to the eye for mating.

The acting all around was top notch and didn't feel at all like it was overacting or too overly cheesy. Everyone here fit their part perfectly as an integral part to the madness. Tom Hardy is quickly becoming the go to guy for tortured, empathetic powerhouses. He was brilliant in Bronson, Warrior, The Drop and The Dark Knight Rises while keeping control of an entire film by himself in the powerful Locke. I have always said that Hardy has one of the most expressive eyes in film as he can portray quiet pain and suffering better than anyone. One look into his eyes and you can read so much without him saying anything. His body language, powerful, silent charisma and brutality make him the perfect fit to resurrect Max for a new generation. Hardy can bring out the humanity in his portrayal of beasts where you don't really know which side of the fence he is on, man or animal. You want him to be ok and be welcomed by a new family of people but that wouldn't be his character. He's a loner. A rebel.

Theron also fit her role as Furiosa like a glove exuding the same power, charisma and cunning as Hardy's Max. It's the kind of role that can catapult an actor to another stratosphere as franchises are incredibly huge right now. She's a character you want to know more of even if you got the gist of it while hearing her backstory. Furiosa is a little more central during some parts of the film and integral because she has something to lose and isn't as far gone as Max. She still has something to strive for and a dream that can be fulfilled so it makes her a little more approachable. Theron has a great no nonsense mentality that doesn't move an inch even when she's approached at gun point. Furiosa's loss runs counterpoint to Max's loss in a great dichotomy of character. In one scene, Furiosa tells Max about a safe haven for the women and you see the pain in her face as she looks in the distance like there has to be something there while Max just looks cold as if there is nothing there at all. They're two similar characters while being completely different mentally and it makes for a great pairing as Hardy and Theron have amazing chemistry together. They go so well of off each other like peas in a pod but not once did it feel like there needed to be a forced romantic sexual involvement. It would do both of their characters a disservice if they were to be involved romantically.

Hoult was by far the most unpredictable in the whole movie as the death obsessed War Boy who hopes to die in a blaze of glory. He looked instantly unrecognizable as his name in the trailer was the only way to know if it was him. Shaved bald and covered in white paint with scars adorned all over his body, he is a somewhat misunderstood soldier and someone you can't keep your eyes off of. And that's not because of the paint, scars or shaved head. He adds much to the film with his own type of madness which is saying something as nearly everyone is mad and steals many scenes that he is in. His manic and desperate attempts for acceptance from Joe and the War Boys are somewhat sad and tragic but funny all the same. You can't help but feel for him. But then you get all excited when he yells ""What a lovely day!!!!"" as he's driving in the middle of a sandstorm, waiting for an epic death.

When it comes to any sequel/prequel/remake/reboot of any kind there is always a need for expansion from previous films which Fury Road has in gusto. One aspect that is awesome is the differing sects of clans, groups and marauders in the desolate Australian landscape. You have allies of Joe like the Bullet Farmers and Gas Town as well as enemies like the Bikers, The Buzzard Tribe and the Vuvalini who all command their own part of territory and do anything to protect it from invading forces. The Vuvalini are also very interesting in that it is wholly composed of women, mostly middle aged but are also battle worn and ready to fight at a moment's notice. They are just as willing to put their lives on the line when they have to and aren't treated any differently if they were men. Having all these groups just makes the world that much bigger and impressive instead of a one group per film like the previous Mad Max films or nearly any franchise. It's great to see how others were affected and how they deal with the new world, landscape and loss of essential resources. You already want to know more about them which makes the film that much more intriguing.

One of the best aspects of the entire film is how Joe commandeers the War Boys to do his bidding at mere will. Using aspects of Viking religion, he creates an entire religion and imparts that they will reach Valhalla if they die gloriously in battle. War Boys prey at the bottom of a monument to steering wheels in an effort to make their lives a little more rounded. But this applies to many aspects of war like Kamikaze pilots during World War II and suicide bombers in the Middle East. Using religion as a form of control to do things that you wouldn't is as old as time and it makes all the more sense that religion would be used on the fringes of society after the entire world has collapsed. The War Boys are so interesting in that they have nothing much too live for since the world had ended so life after death became the ultimate price as it must be better than life currently. All they do is work on cars, drive and hope to see their friends in the afterlife so anything to live for makes the current life just a little bit more tolerable. It also goes to show that whenever there is no hope to be gained in an empty world and there are people who need someone or something to guide them amid a wasteland, religion will be the most powerful tool of all.

Being that I grew up watching Mad Max and The Road Warrior and loved both of them dearly while loving Mel Gibson's quiet, tortured performance in them, it remains a special part of my heart. I exclude Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome since it was awful in too many ways. Not to mention that I cannot stand the influx of remakes/sequels/prequels/reboots that invade the screens. Too many of them hardly do anything to stand out. But after watching the trailers, I knew that Fury Road would be different and would go against the grain in nearly every possible way. It's a rare category that it's one of the very few remakes/sequels/prequel/reboots that can be appreciated alone for its genius from its brilliant counterparts. It's so out there that it basically flips the entire genre on its head. There is only one other film that I would mark as one of the greatest action films of all time and that is The Raid 2: Berandal where that itself was also a groundbreaking achievement. Mad Max: Fury Road is one of those rare every once in a while blips of brilliance amid a sea of mediocrity. Much like The Matrix, it may be hard to understand for some at first but eventually it will find its place amid the all-time greats from a wide populace, earning the respect it sorely deserves. Five glorious deaths during battle and a trip to Valhalla out of five.",NEUTRAL

Everything from the actors performances, to the way the film was shot to the action, it was all superbly done, what a thrill from start to finish! Tom Hardy owned the Mad Max role, it's a bit different from Mel Gibson's portrayal of Mad Max but it works. I don't know what people were going on about this being a feminist movie that's nonsense, it isn't it's just a thrilling Action packed movie with a lot of heart. It's not just dumb action, there's a lot debt to the characters with a rich story and  spectacular performance from the actors. If you haven't see it Go See It!",NEUTRAL

"May 22, 2015","Mad Max Fury Road is a spectacle to behold in the best of sense. It's epic, grandiose and every other adjective there is under the sun to say how grand in scale this film is.

The film is set presumably after the first two Mad Max outings wisely ignoring the camp that is Thunderdome.

We open to see Max Rockatansky surveying the desert to a grim voice over and being haunted by the failure to protect his daughter. Unfortunately he is thrust upon by the Warboys the personal errand boys of Immortan Joe who is the warlord of the region. The boys wreck Max's car and put him into slavery as a universal blood donor for malnourished warboys such as Nux (Nicholas Hoult) at the aptly named Citadel.

At the Citadel we come across Imperator Furiousa (a commanding Charlize Theron) who decides to sneak Immortan Joes beautiful young war brides to a better place on a regular gas supply. Naturally Joe isn't too pleased about this and sends his armada to reclaim the brides and kill Furiousa. Thus the Fury Road is set.

I have to admit, I was impressed with this film, the stunt were awesome with very limited CGI used and even then the CG used was impressive, the narrative and dialogue may be the simplist trope of survival but it works well. I was also impressed with the fact the Miller had created such an immersive and realised post-apocalyptic world.

There were elements which jarred and didn't really make sense but as soon as these moments came along they would be drowned out by a spectacular action sequence.

The acting all round was solid with Theron probably just stealing the limelight from Tom Hardy's Max. The supporting characters out with Hoult and the War Brides were pretty stock and interchangeable. The War Brides included Rosie Huntington-Whitely who isn't as bad as she was in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, but isn't completely believable either. Zoe Kravitz character has even less to do. Yet all the brides manage to get you to empathise with them.

Overall this an entertaining almost at times operatic entry in to the Mad Max franchise with good performances, excellent stunt work and CGI, Max is back, roll on Mad Max: Wasteland.",NEUTRAL
"May 22, 2015","Just because a movie is a reboot of an '80s movie no one needed to see twice in an environment where original movies can't be written in a really tired setting, DOES NOT mean it can't be a unique and artistic cinematic experience. 

Completely solid setting, barely any tedium, this movie goes full speed from the opening scene until it turns around and speed back just as fast. It is never boring. It is probably the only movie that actually deserves to be called ""visceral,"" despite how overused it is. 

Hollywood, take note. You don't need to pander to the audience, stuffing tired and bland exposition down the throats of your audience. Step on the gas, and let the world speak for itself. The characters barely speak, they just act. They do. And it works spectacularly. You don't need Joe McDumbarms saving Princess Sweettits every goddamn time.

"May 22, 2015","Guys it's simple, Mad Max Fury Road is a masterpiece! Not only does this movie have great action, it has amazing characters, dialog and heart. This movie features great FX that are all practical. About 90% of the explosions and action are all practical and makes you enjoy the movie much more. The movie is set in a post apocalyptic world and it does a good job at setting a dark tone and world. You really feel the characters motivation because of the world the movie is set in. The cinematography is also fantastic. There is no shaky cam, it's all marvelously shot. The acting is perfect. Tom Hardy as Mad Max was perfect. In fact I think he was better then Mel Gibson. The villain and characters are great also. Obviously you have Max, but the stand out characters are the villain, and the character named Furiosia. Some of the best action includes these characters. In the end Mad Max Fury road is a high octane, action joyride. It has great characters, acting, story, setting and of course brilliant action! This is definitely one of the best movies of the year! Absolutely AMAZING!! Perfect from start to finish! Can I say any more. YES Overall, this is a gleefully insane film.

"May 22, 2015","Imagine this: you're in a theater, but instead of simply watching a film, you're grabbed by the shoulders and violently shaken for 2 hours; THAT'S the fantastic experience of MM:FR. It's less an adrenaline rush than a direct I.V.-shot of caffeine into your bloodstream. Faster and more furious than the most recent car-based movie, it's kinetic action in the style of a fever dream. A punk-rock, post-apocalyptic nightmare that's a feast for the senses, benefiting from director Miller's visionary and fearless eye. Pure, unadulterated insanity that reminds us what it looks like when great artists try something uniquely extraordinary and succeed.
Miller's main achievement is getting everyone to buy into this insanity. With the scale of a blockbuster and the soul of an indie, MM:FR is unlike anything you'll see in theatres this year. Hardy as the new Max continues the characters reactive-style heroics with just enough heart behind his crazy eyes, and all the supporting cast portray their varying levels of madness with crazed conviction. However, all of these talented performances are overshadowed by the amazing aesthetic. Through grimy, herky-jerky visuals, Miller gives us practical-effects-filled action sequences that are masterpiece level. 
This isn't to say there isn't something deeper going on. On top of being of a feminist manifesto, a study of religious extremism, and an argument that capitalism leads to death, it's ultimately a moving story of equality and hope that proves goodness can defeat desperation. Haven't seen the Mel Gibson originals? That's okay. Don't let the daunting task of seeing all those first keep you from one of the greatest action films in years.",NEUTRAL

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and I wouldn't call it a bad film or anything but with critics and viewers falling all over themselves about how great it is I'm just left thinking I missed something, or I'm harder to please.  Without spoiling the ending, I can sum up the movie fairly easily.  Take the Tanker scene from the Road Warrior...one big vehicle driving through the wasteland while dozens of smaller vehicles chase and attack it relentlessly.  Now stretch that scene into a full movie and you get Fury Road.   The characters are (mostly) new, and the reason for their journey slightly changed, but the bulk of the film is a big long action scene.  Having said that, the action and stunts and visuals are over-the-top in the best way.  It is a non-stop gang brawl on wheels and that is very entertaining for what it is.  If you liked the other films in the series than you absolutely have to go see it.  I may even see it again to figure out why everyone is so excited.  98% Tomatometer doesn't happen very often so the chances are if you are a movie fan or critic you'll love this movie.

"May 22, 2015","Considering the wave of terrible 90's Scifi sequels/remakes we've had fired our way in the past few years (Terminator, Robocop, Total Recall etc.) Fury Road's success has been more than a pleasant surprise.

It takes a lot of very 80's dystopian post-apocalyptic sensibilities and puts it in modern context. The relevant storytelling, characterization and heavy play on social themes make it a compelling tale but it's the barebones, relentlessly unforgiving visuals that make it a thrilling ride through and through.

There's more to the world of Mad Max than sand dunes and angry people with automobiles though, with very little screen time Miller manages to convey a very elaborate society full of warrior tribes, caste systems and cultural/religious customs that are intriguing if not visually iconic.

Let's also not forget the cast of characters representing a variety of minorities without feeling like forced tokens. A phenomenal performance by Charlize Theron breathes badassery into Furiosa and the manic Nux played by Hoult! It seems the best way to bring back the ""strong silent type"" hero is to in fact keep him silent. (who would've guessed?) Hardy skims by as Max with stern looks, grunts and single syllable words and for that we love him.

At the end of the day Fury Road is both a nonsensical, visceral action packed adventure about a bunch of rebels fighting the system but also an intelligent character study with a dab of social commentary. Some of these folks are larger than life (Max) others victims/villains turned heroes (Furiosa, Breeders, Nux) which ever you appreciate more you're both cheering and enamored by the spectacle.",NEUTRAL

"May 22, 2015","I write this as a compliment to George Miller, because the last man who made me feel this way when leaving a theatre was Edgar Wright. The last time I exclaimed these words was the first time I enjoyed Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World.  I said, ""I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before.""  This was my first thought after experiencing Mad Max: Fury Road.

Now, if you've somehow found your way to this review, there's something you should know about Mad Max: Fury Road. It's bananas. Absolutely 100% batshit crazy. No, I'm serious - it's not 80s campy, it's just crazy. But that's what makes this movie special. It runs on wild manic insanity.  I mean, there's a dude, bungee corded to a mack truck, playing a guitar that spits fire - this movie is crazy pants. But oh, does it work!

I never really got into the Mad Max trilogy.  It was one of those things that we talk about in our film geek circles and I just sort of stayed quiet.  But even still, I loved Mad Max: Fury Road.  Actually, my movie going compadres enjoyed it as well, and they hadn't spent anytime with the trilogy. I know the original made Sci-Fi/Action movie history, but I'm going to just say this now - so will Fury Road.

What I mean by this is that I haven't seen a game changer to the genre in a long time.  Maybe the last time was The Bourne Identity or even, The Matrix.  These two films inspired elements in other films for years, and some we still see today.  Daniel Craig's Bond would be nothing without the Jason Bourne films.  And we'd be damned not to see influences in more action flicks with the help of Mad Max: Fury Road.  It's that damn good.

It's a straight chase actioner, but because the universe is setup with the type of mutants you'd see in a post apocalyptic world, you get some very interesting characters.  Don't let anyone tell you differently, this movie has characters with range and archs.  Nicholas Hoult's Nux & Charlize Theron's Furiosa will steal the show...and maybe your heart. Tom Hardy is great in the role of Max, but for the story, he's just sort of along for the ride. Charlize is the star of this movie.  If you've seen this flick no one is saying women aren't complete badasses. (Also see Emily Blunt in Edge of Tomorrow)

In the action movie Hollywood of today, I never thought I'd see a movie with such daring practical effects again. And George Miller's stunts work so well, it was as if I was seeing them for the first time on film.  Which of course is not the case.  Before the land of CGI and green screens all we ever saw was this sort of practical action-piece - but never to the extent that Miller creates with Fury Road.

Oh, and you know what's crazier? George freaking Miller at the age of 70 walks off of doing the HAPPY FEET movies to come back to the ultra violent colourful world of Mad Max?!  Not to mention, 30 years after Thunderdome!  Mr. Miller, you have my unparalleled respect.  See this movie now.",NEUTRAL

"May 22, 2015","The best thing I can say about this movie was that I didn't walk out. The cinematography was impressive as was the action sequences. In fact, the entire movie was one big action sequence. So I guess that if you like movies like ""fast and furious"", then this was a masterpiece. Which, judging from the number of 5 star reviews, this was the majority of the audience that went to see this film. The plot is minimal -- a ""car chase"" away and a ""car chase back. The acting was a mixed bag. A couple of minor characters did a surprisingly good job, but the leads --Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron were terrible. Anyone could have played the Tom Hardy character (Max), and he didn't have any intelligible lines... Charlize Theron acted like ""I need this paycheck, so I'll say my lines and use my pouty face"". One thing that was jarring was the way everyone else in the movie had a post-apocalytic australian(?) accent, while Theron sounded like a Valley girl suffering from clinical depression. This was an ultra-violent, bombastic, over-the-top theater of the grotesque. I couldn't turn away...so 2 stars.",NEUTRAL

"May 21, 2015","I have no idea where to start with this review other than to say this makes the position of Die Hard as my all time favorite action movie look rather uncertain. For starters the action is absolutely wonderful, it is not only exhilarting but shot and edited beautifully and doesn't go for the quick edit rubbish of recent action films with wide and long shots like action movies of old. The score is easily the best I have heard in a long time, it makes the action set pieces all the better and all the more thrilling. The cast is great, Tom Hardy really is solid in the role of Max and Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa is easily equal in terms of not only emotion but the ability to kick just as much arse. The plot is good, the reliance on visuals over actual words is a great idea but where there is talking to be done the script is bang on. Overall this is the action movie of not just the decade but the last 25 years.",NEUTRAL

There is little to no CGI in this (one scene when they go into a dust storm and the way they do it is amazing).  All of the vehicles are real and distinct. The stunts are real. The story is simple, yet captivating.  The dialogue is minimal, yet perfect. The acting is superb.  The directing and cinematography are sublime. And no one is a super ninja or super hero, it's all believable action which actually raises the stakes (you know a spin kick won't get them out of this).

Mad Max immediately ruined, ruined Avengers 2 and all my other favorite super hero movies.  It's the movie of the year.  GO SEE IT!  It'll probably ruin the new Star Wars too.

Relentless and breathtakingly paced, where one visually stunning set piece follows another, and yet another, proving that you cannot have too much adrenalin-fuelled action if they are staged this effectively and spectacularly. The choice to use less CGI in favour of more inventive stunts and real effects is the other reason why this movie will stand out from other similar action thrillers you will see this year.

"May 21, 2015","Magnificent to a million magnitudes. 

Firstly, do not be fooled by the seemingly dull orange desert the story is set in. George Miller, visionary, finds a way to make a barren wasteland into one of the most beautiful movie settings I've seen, ever. Sand flows like water, dust dancing in a sandstorm, this film does not lack visceral visual stimulation by any means. In fact, supplement the cinematography with the operatic action and chase sequences and we end up with a finished product that keeps the audience at the edge of their seats throughout film. Speaking of the action sequences, the special effects are the thing of wonder. Remember The Hobbit Trilogy, how the whole saga looked like one long video-game cut-scene? This film is NOT that!! Thank the movie gods for that. This film looks very organic: it was obvious cars were actually being smashed to pieces and stuntmen were hired. Of course there are a few, justifiable exceptions to this-CGI is almost always needed, and I mean that literally, in every genre. Yes, even RomComs-but even those parts didn't seem gimmicky. For example, there is a scene early in the film where we find ourselves in the middle of a giant sandstorm. Instead of taking me out of the film, the special effects actually worked and I felt as if I were also inside the storm.The bottom line is this: go watch this movie in theatres, or you will regret it. It is meant to be seen on the silver screen.

Now lets get to the plot. It's simple, as it is meant to be a straightforward action film. To my preference it does a good job of not needing to explain every little thing of the why's and how's of the diegetic world. For example, presumably the War Boys are called ""Half-lives"" because they constantly need blood transfusions or they will die; we can discern this because they are all pale and implicitly not considered to be born ""normal."" Yet, it is not the plot that fascinated me from a writer's standpoint but the intricacies and the meticulousness needed to create a dystopian world such as this one. Granted that this is the fourth chapter in the saga, still this one has clearly revamped the world into a place even more desolate and dangerous than before. Despite being out of place in space and in time, we as the audience, or at least most of us, can relate to the situation of our protagonists: they live in a world where a select few own virtually all resources and wealth; those in power are only there because of chauvinism and nepotism; the plebeians are merely given as much as needed to survive and nothing more; besides the ruling class, everybody is either a sex slave or just as slave; literally everybody needs to fight to stay alive, even Max, the one who is second to none. So different our wolds are, and yet oh so similar.
Surprisingly though, there are moments in the dialogue that I found to be a little redundant. At times the protagonists would simply state the obvious for the sake of reiterating the current situation. It was a bit unsettling, but more so humorous. These lines were delivered a bit unnaturally, and understandably so because not all of the actors in the film were top-notch. Still, and maybe I am being a bit clement here, but ultimately this was not a big deal to me. 


Speaking of the actors, Tom Hardy... is straight up gangsta. I've always been a fan ever since watching Warrior, and man did he deliver. Not that there is relatively too much to do in this film in regards to acting, especially since he's played unstable and insane people in the past, but he does play mad very well. And it's hard to fit in Mel Gibson's Mad Max shoes; you really do have to have a certain level of charisma to get people to like psychopathic-but-relatable murdering survivalists. Nevertheless, Max is but thrust into the story without his own volition. Furiosa, Theron's character, is who drives the plot, thus technically making her the true heroine of this narrative. Max's psychological profile is standard in some ways: screws loose in the head because of some past trauma and now all he does is survive. That's how he starts the film, and it's how he ends the film. His only real development as a character is that he learns to make new friends. Furiosa is the one out for redemption, she is the one with the mission, and unfortunately for her it is harder practically than theoretically to succeed. There were many moments where I felt that she had truly been defeated, only to see her triumph once again. Badass. 
Surprisingly, from an acting standpoint, I would have to give the best performance to Hoult's Nux. He plays at mutinous war boy. I don't want to give too much of the story, but talk about playing crazy! Man, I thought Mad Max was of his rocker, wait until you get a load of the War Boys.  

Finally, the music. I loved the score, and I mean really loved the score. I've only ever bought the official soundtrack to one film before this one (I'm buying it tonight!), and that movie was Star Trek: Into Darkness. My favorite is the same music they used for the trailer. It's upbeat and modern with its electronica, hardcore in a heavy metal sense, and epically operatic. I can't get enough of it. If you need something to pump you up for a workout or rev you up in the morning, I recommend listening to the soundtrack. 

A highly visceral dystopian opera that wont dull with multiple viewings. Truly spectacular George Miller.  
Splendid from top to finish. If I had to describe the film it would be include the adjectives intense, thrilling, and charismatic. 

Yes, that and then mix it with a little bit of movie magic, and you get Mad Max: Fury Road. 

One for the ages. 

4/4 stars.

"May 21, 2015","A frantic, frenetic, post-apocalyptic romp that sets a new bar for the cinematic chase scene in a way Tarantino could only imagine of doing in Death Proof.  The mythology of the film isn't explicitly explained and the story is patchy, although this comes across as carefully meted out rather that slapdash as is so common in the action genre.  It works for the most part, but the juxtaposition of foregrounded action and barely mentioned plot does start to wear out its welcome before the end.  If anything, the film's biggest issue is that the whole story could be told without its central character; Tom Hardy is a performer who disappears inside his characters, playing a protagonist who's more cypher than hero, he all but disappears in the company of strong personalities like Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult.  A film that needs to be judged on its own merits, but one that still could have been better.",NEUTRAL

Luckily, Mad Max Furry Road, opts to go practical effects over visual, aiding in the sense of danger.

"May 20, 2015","Mad Max was always on my radar. I saw the original when I was very young and didn't think too much of it. What stuck with me most was the third installment of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. It was the silliness behind it all. So here we are 30 years later, with yet another installment of Mad Max with as much original pieces to the puzzle as possible, and the ending result is: it was really good but not amazing to me. I am really rough critic when doling out near perfect scores. First off let me say that I commend George Milller for coming back 30 Years later and doing this for us again. I also appreciate the work of Hugh Keays-Byrne and his awesome portrayal as Immortan Joe. I may be one of the biggest Tom Hardy fans on the planet, as I love everything that man is in and he picked up the reigns as Gibson's Mad Max and really made it his own, so kudos to him.

"May 20, 2015","The most massively over-rated and hyped up movie I have seen for many years. Fantastic direction and editing, very good special effects and some great 3D shots, and also credible acting and solid characters. Unfortunately it lacked something important - substance and logic. If you look closely you can see why the characters are what they are, and you can understand what is going on and why, but the questions still remains - what is the point? Like some people who look so deep into a painting that they can see Jesus and/or the Univers, this movie has brought out a lot of 'technical' praise. But IMO I saw it for what it was - and that is yet another pointless sequel/prequel type movie drawing (sucking) off the success of its ground breaking predecessor. Mad Max had a point - there is no point in this movie - just a series of action and effects, mixed in with some interesting characters and their 'redemption'. Nothing new here - and my advice to those who see things as 'ground-breaking' - is to step back a bit and take a better 'big picture' look again. It has all been done before - and done better.",NEUTRAL

Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are just so great.  Didn't notice until I read IMDB that the villain is the same actor as the original Mad Max movie's villain which is awesome!

Combining amazing action scenes with a surprising amount of character development, for both Max as well as nearly every other major character, all combined with glorious practical effects, has lead to the creation of one of the most amazingly over-the-top films of all time. This is a movie where the main villain has a guy strapped to a truck specifically so he can play an electric guitar (WHICH DOUBLES AS A FLAMETHROWER) as his army drive after Max, Furiosa, and Immortan Joe's wives. I have no doubt that this film has flaws somewhere in it, but there is so much that distracts me from that, with explosions, amazing fight choreography, interesting ideas about post-apocalyptic life, as well as a good helping of development to all the central characters all make it overcome whatever flaws it has.

"May 20, 2015","A brutally poetic hymn to 1980s B-level sci-fi films, Mad Max: Fury Road never stops to explain itself--it hits the throttle in the first scene and never lets up in its descent into the bizarre, the horrifying, and the insane.  A nitro-driven film that ironically wallows in excess while depicting the harrowing consequences of such waste and greed, Fury Road is about power, survival, and the desire for freedom.  It is an existential plunge into a literal wasteland where macho posturing allows an oligarchy of sorts to develop, and we follow along with those who dare to seek freedom.  Surprisingly feminist, Fury Road attacks the patriarchy and the class system alike.  While its story and politics may lack subtlety, this fits perfectly with the history of films to which it pays homage.  As each new beautiful, nightmarish, or just plain bad-ass tableaux unfolds, one thing remains certain: you will never be able to look away from the screen.",NEUTRAL

Woman is generous and when given the chance, will save the masses unlike man who will only abuse his power. There are places for overdone feminist anthems. Mad Max was not one of those places.

This is not Citizen Kane.
Or Papillon.
Or Leon.
Or Apocalypse now.
Or Total recall.

You people ARE most deffinetly jaded!!!!!!
(I wonder how many people who gave this a 5 star-""drop everything"" rating, would enjoy Waterworld if it came out today and with no changes made.

A lot.)

In a time of masses of unbelievably bad, rotten, brainless Hollywood drivel slobbering all over the place and of course, over the one popular genre people use to unwind in particular,
anything with even the mildest hint of originality seems to receive considerable praise.

If you have seen the other MadMax movies you will see nothing new here.
Really.
Not at all.
It IS very, true to his form and thus, formulaic.
It is basicaly, a remake of MadMax 2.

And in true 80's fashion it starts of strong and looses a lot of steam along the way.

Nevertheless the way that Miller fleshes out aspects of behaviour and the archaic system of belief in a post-apocalyptic society, including speech*** and values, builds a very enjoyable and strong foundation for an exciting movie ride.
And this was only possible with a considerably larger budget than 4 Million dollars.
(Still, with the limited entourage and all of the desert shots it really makes you wonder how little you can get for 150 million these days. 2015)

BUT, 
the rest of the movie does not care much to build or expand upon it at all. Opportunities immensly missed. 

A lot of things, he might be trying to say, become, to me, very non-sensical and...mushy. 
This is pulp ficiton. 
Really..

Tom Hardy? Yes! 

Charlize Theron? Nooooooooo.

As Imperator Furiosa I really believe Miller could have made a better choice for a female road warrior.

I kept asking myself, what is she? Composed? Unhinged? Ruthless? Lonely? Insecure? Dedicated? And so on and so forth...
Whatever it is, I do not think you can tell by looking at her face. 
Her face never tells a story. She just is.
She just looks.
Great. 
Yeah. Ok. I get that. But I knew it before.

Just no good.
(Better than Tina Turner though)(Just in case you dont get it....sigh)

To me, it is a failed acting attempt.

With either very little to go on or no or too little imagination on her part.

In respect to his portrayal of women, to me, Miller is still a very 2 dimensional and 1980's kind of guy.

"May 19, 2015","I read the reviews on RT for Max Max Fury Road  after hearing that it was directed by the original director of the 80's mad max movies, which I had seen back then and thought were ok. The 98% positive reviews had me a little concerned  because the last time I saw a movie based on high RT reviews (It follows) I was very disappointed because the movie was very bad. I decided to take a chance and saw Mad Max Fury Road in an RPX theater (enhanced screen and sound). I wouldn't say Mad Max was as bad as It Follows, but it wasn't good either. The RPX theater by the way just seems to have louder, but worse sound than normal theaters. Was not worth the extra $10. And the movie was not worth any of the money.

My main problem with the movie is that there is zero character development. There is nothing at all. ""Die Hard"" by comparison is a movie of incredibly extensive and exhaustive character development. I did not care about any of these people. A grain of sand has more presence than Tom Hardy's Max character. The women next to him had only a little more. At least there was a lot of sand. This movie also sets new heights for unrealistic action scenes. Someone forgot to tell the director that humans are made of flesh and bone and that there is this thing called physics. The action scenes grow increasingly tedious with just a lot of things happening fast. You end up wishing it could just all happen already and be done. As for a movie plot... it's just action scenes based around a bunch of women looking for a green grocer or something dumb like that which turns out to just be where they escaped from. The guitar guy that some reviews mention is silly. You can't even make out what he is playing most of the time. It's not metal... It's just noisy. 

Really, the whole movie is a big hype job with nothing special about it... just a lot of action scenes strung together  with mostly ugly people and ugly limbless women running around doing dumb and very unrealistic things. I was very happy when the movie ended and from now on when I see a movie with a high RT rating percentage, I am going to consider that a tip off to avoid the movie at all costs.",NEUTRAL

The types of movies that just throw you into a world with no explanation always throw me for a minute. But, what I will say is that once I'm in, I am sucked in 100%. And this I was sucked in 1000%. What is this society? Why is almost everyone from it sick? How did Furiosa become the only woman in power? Why is there a flame throwing guitar? Now, these are all questions that are still swirling around my brain, but in the moment, I could have cared less. I was simply along for the ride. The visuals are absolutely stunning (that sandstorm at the beginning. Holy hell.) The acting from the main characters is on point. (Charlize Theron is my queen.)

There's basically little to no character development in it at all, so I didn't give a crap about what was happening to anyone throughout the whole thing. Half the time I couldn't even understand what anyone was saying anyway, so there's that. I dunno, other than the visuals, nothing was compelling about this at all. We wanted to walk out halfway but waited a while longer to no good end. The 1 and 1/2 stars I'm giving this is for the guy with the flaming guitar, or the Gwar truck, as my husband calls it.

"May 19, 2015","How best to describe the brutal, unflinching, cinematic brilliance that director George Miller throws at us in Mad Max: Fury Road? It's volcanic, electrifying hell on wheels. It's been nearly 30 years since Miller, now 70, left his Mad Max trilogy that starred Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky, a road warrior on a mission of vengeance for his murdered family in a dystopian wasteland ruled by biker gangs and warlords. Since then, Miller---a former ER doctor turned filmmaker--hos gone on to direct such family-friendly features as Babe: Pig In The City and two Happy Feet movies.

Goddamn, how good it is to have him back among the dark and twisted. The long-in-the-works Fury Road is an R-rated unrelenting romper stomper, a $150 million chase epic that soars on Miller's indisputable visionary genius. There's no Happy Feet schmaltz here.

Is this trip down Fury Road always coherent and credible. Not a chance, but so what. You just sit back and hold on for dear life. Brit actor Tom Hardy steps into the iconic role for Gibson as Max and he does the role proud. His first words begin in voice-over, 'My name is Max. My world is fire. And blood.' Got that right. Plagued by visions of his lost child, Max is taken captive by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who also played Toecutter in 1979's Mad Max), a terrifying warlord who controls his people by controlling their water supply. Joe's elite soldiers, the inbred, bald war boys, smear their bodies in white paint, gulp down breast milk to mitigate radiation effects and live off the promise of a fantastical afterlife full of erotic pleasures ('I live, I die. I live again!)

The plot hits the gas when Joe's trusted ally Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a warrior with a mechanical left arm, goes rogue and takes off in an armored oil rig with Joe's five breeder wives,played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton and Riley Keough. Joe and his entire army are in hot pursuit, including Nux (a wonderful Nicholas Hoult), who has Max tied in front of his speeding car as he taps Max's arm for blood.

There's no room for exposition in the plot---cooked up by Miller and co-writers Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris---that is essentially one big vroom. The fact that the characters come through so vividly and distinctly is a tribute to the actors. First, Hardy is muzzled with a mask, similar to what he wore as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. 'I bet you want that damn thing off your face,' Furiosa tells him. As she sees him whole, she and Max form a bond that is all show, not telling. Dialog is minimal, especially when it comes to Max. Hardy and Theron are an amazing team, but the film really belongs to Theron. She's dynamite in a sensational performance that blends hard-won grit and gravity. She's the bruised heart and soul of this Fury Road. The feminist overtones may get some fanboys' blood boiling. So what. It's that audaciousness to not reduce female characters to playthings that lifts this action gem above the herd.

As Furiosa seeks redemption for her sins, Miller keeps the eye-popping images coming, whether it's a vicious sandstorm or the arresting sight of a guitar player whose instrument shoots flames as others literally beat the war drums. Miller keeps the green screen and CGI at a minimum as well, and the stunt work defines state-of-the-art as bodies and vehicles bash one another amidst a real life landscape. The film was shot in Africa's Namib Desert by the amazing John Seale (The Perfect Storm, The English Patient), 72, who was coaxed out of retirement by Miller.

In short, Mad Max: Fury Road is a rare occasion, featuring award-caliber work from editor Margaret Sixel, Miller's wife, to the dazzling costumes by Jenny Bevin and the thunderous score from Dutch composer Junkie XL. Mad Max: Fury Road kicks all the ass. All of it.  It will knock you sideways.",NEUTRAL

"May 19, 2015","I can't even remember the last time I've watched the Mad Max series starring Mel Gibson this was a very long ago, 30 years later a forth film gets released in Cinemas written, directed and produced by George Miller this is the fourth film in the Mad Max franchise. Mad Max: Fury Road does feel like a reboot in totally different way but it's not with Mel Gibson being too old in playing the role he is now replaced by Tom Hardy.

Does George Miller keep the series fresh after 30 years? the answer is yes making it feel like an R rated movie with tons of car chases and explosions, Fury Road is nothing but a work of art set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland; story starts of being haunted by his turbulent past, Mad Max believes the best way to survive is to wander alone. Nevertheless, he becomes swept up with a group fleeing across the Wasteland in a War Rig driven by an elite Imperator, Furiosa (Charlize Theron). They are escaping a Citadel tyrannized by the Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), from whom something irreplaceable has been taken. Enraged, the Warlord marshals all his gangs and pursues the rebels ruthlessly in the high-octane Road War that follows.

For a two hour film it really does try and impressive you on how much everything can be done in one film based on survival, action and an eruption of craziness which just makes this perfect for a film. If you've played games like Fallout and Borderlands you will really be in for a treat on what surprises can be found in Fury Road but if you've not played both games Fury Road does give you an idea on how you should prepared if a post-apocalyptic would happen later in the future. I would be very surprised if they make another Mad Max film after this one being so successful worldwide because we know that George Miller knows how to make a good action movie when we see one and the fact that Fury Road makes us want more movies like these, if you haven't seen this movie yet I would highly recommend you seeing this movie.",NEUTRAL

The first of this franchise that saw was ""the Road Warrior"" and while it had its own share of blood n' roar, did have a relatively interesting storyline as well as the comic relief from the gyro pilot and the feral kid.  This was just one grim deafening scene after another with some very poorly thought out ""twists"" such as (spoiler alert) the otherwise savvy Furiosa not having even the smarts of the not-so-genius Max in being able to figure out that driving for 160 days (with what fuel?) across a salt pan was not exactly a great plan. Hey, and given that even at a very low daily mileage of saw a couple of 100, that would have taken them 32,000 miles.

"May 19, 2015","Mad max: fury road is another movie in the mad max series. It is not a reboot. It is a continuation of mad max stories. This one takes place between the road warrior and beyond the thunderdome. First off this movie is beautiful, every single shot looks fantastic. It looks like a painting. The visuals in this are also so beautiful, almost the whole movie is practical effects and you can see in the action scenes that this real. Like the old ones there isn't much dialogue, just pure action. The acting is great. Tom Hardy plays a great max, of course Mel Gibson well always be the best max but Tom does a great of carrying that character. The one character who Steals every scene is Charlize Theron's character Imperator Furiosa. Every scene she's in, she's just kills it. The action is unbelievable. George miller knows how to shoot old school action and he does not disappoint. Even we there's 50 cars on the screen, you can see perfectly what's happen. This movie is worth paying the ticket for IMAX 3D. This makes George miller a mastermind and the whole movie a masterpiece.

The special effects, action and sound were really good but the plot was basically just a car chase for 2 hours non-stop. It was okay for the first half of the movie but then when they just did it again, I was pretty over it. There was hardly any acting outside of the chases.

"May 19, 2015","Easily the largest scale Mad Max movie of them all. Let's get one thing straight before I start nitpicking: This is a must-see action movie. This is probably the best action movie that has come out since the 80s when it movies had this kind of ultra violence and carnage. From the minute the movie starts it is going at full speed and it never lets up.

So with that out of the way, let's get to nitpicking!

First, there is just so much action that it all kind of blends together. That sounds kind of strange, but it is just constant mayhem and destruction that thinking back on the movie I have a hard time picking out one key moment where I can say to someone ""Remember when..."". This doesn't mean the script is out of control or that there is too much going on to comprehend, it just means that there was so much good that nothing really stood out as great.

Tom Hardy is fine in the main role, but at times it felt more like he was doing his Mel Gibson impersonation as opposed to making Max his own. He does a fine job, but nothing tremendous.

Many probably wonder how this compares to The Road Warrior (the often considered best of the franchise). Personally, I think The Road Warrior was a better movie. I just found it more memorable with moments and characters that are unforgettable. Plus, the action (while nowhere near the level of Fury Road) was built up to as opposed to just a constant. I can see why someone would like Fury Road more, but I think The Road Warrior accomplished more as one of the all-time great b-movies than Fury Road accomplishes as a big budget Hollywood film.

The movie just has so much going on and it's a lot of fun, and there could be no dialogue at all and you would still have a great time watching this movie. It is highly recommended and you need to watch it if you haven't already.",NEUTRAL

"May 19, 2015","Mad Max Fury Road is a film that from the opening punches you in the face and continues to do so until the end, and when it is over, you sit there in your seat, wanting to be punched over and over again. A film that is going to redefine from the original the vehicle action film. This film makes nearly every action film look like a cartoon of amateurs. The Fast series, Avengers, and all others pale in comparison. The real only thing the film lacks is character development, who are these people we are rooting for? We get that it is survival of the fittest, but why are they the fittest and why are we watching them? Once you get past that, which you do in about 8 minutes into the movie, you sit there in awe watching the spectacle unfold before you. It is so engrossing that you nearly miss the one huge blunder of the the film. When they decide to turn back and go back they way they came, the mountain they just passed through, that was blown up is magically put back together exactly the way it was before it was blown up, allowing them to pass freely.

"May 19, 2015","MAD MAX: FURY ROAD REVIEW!!!!!!! grin emoticon
To say I was looking forward to this one is a understatement and sitting in my local IMAX right in the middle of row ""A"" as soon as a dirty industrial Warner Brother's logo appeared with the sound of mad revving engines I knew this was gonna be an experience and OH MY GOD WAS IT!!!
The shear scope of this movie is so Jaw dropping I had to remember to breath in and out on occasion, the beautiful imagination in both plot and visuals will surely be the front runner to scoop up at Oscars on the technical side next year!
It would be hard to imagine anyone else taking on the role of Max other than Mel Gibson but Tom Hardy fits is just great in the road warriors boots and with an amazing supporting cast makes the whole experience a absolute treat but where this movie soars is in its action and where ""The Road Warrior"" is considered one of the best car chase scenes ever put on film that now looks like a child playing cars in a sandbox compared to the mayhem of action seen in this flick!
George Miller did not have the luxury of CGI back in his day and though there is a lot used in this film where the car mayhem is concerned it's bloody hard to tell what was shot for real and what was 1's & 0's!
For it's 2 hour runtime less then 30 minutes is spent parked with just enough time to catch a breath and the rest is spent in top gear revving up the Apocalyptic highway to hell gasping for breath!!!
All in all this is a gob smacking flick that will want to viewed time and time again with the only slight disappointing thing about it is that it did not have a part from Actor Bruce Spence!
With already word of a green light for 2 more sequels to come I cant wait to see which road Miller takes Max Rockatansky down next!!!",NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2015",These are the kinda movies I want to make!,NEUTRAL
"May 19, 2015","The number one complaint I've been seeing about Fury Road is that there's not much of a story. I would respond by saying, there might not be as much story as you could *want*, but there is certainly as much as you could *need*. The plot isn't deep, or complex, or intricate, or philosophical. but it's there, and it makes sense. Just last year, John Wick showed us that you can get away with a pretty thin premise, if you work hard enough on building a thick, palpable world. And the world of Fury Road is something else entirely, I can see why people aren't blown away by the story, but the world is incredible.

There has been much discussion as to whether Max himself, or his cohort Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron) is the star of the film. I would argue that neither of them are. Director George Miller is. This is his vision. Warner Brothers took a big risk when they handed a 70 year old man nearly two hundred million dollars to revitalise his franchise which has been dead for 30 years, then get out of the way and let him do his thing. But it paid off. Fury Road is more of an ""experience"" than most movies are, it just happens to be a great film, too. 

The stunt work and visual effects deserve praise all to themselves. According to the filmmakers, roughly ten percent of all the effects were done with CGI. The other NINETY are practical, and it oozes with that spectacle. You really can feel the maximum force of the future sitting in that theatre, which is a rare and unexpected pleasure.

It's my highest rated film of 2015 thus far, in fact, it's one of only five films I've given more than 4 stars in the past five years.

I think the title should have been ""Imperator Furiosa - There and Back Again"" The art direction and cinematography are exceptional and are the stars of the show. There's MAYBE 100 lines of dialogue in the whole movie, the vehicles are more memorable than the characters and if this were the first movie in the franchise, people would be left saying ""Max who?"". Much has been made of the political text of the movie in reviews and being someone greatly annoyed (and concerned) with heavy handed leftist political diatribes in entertainment, it is there if you want it, but does not detract from the ""story"".

I can't remember the last time I've seen an action film this gorgeous, this violent, and so bizarrely bonkers, but also has such heart and soul to it. George Miller's return to the franchise he created over 30 years ago is not just a standard reboot/sequel, but one of the most exciting and thrilling action extravaganzas in recent history. The pure realism of the stunt work, the chaotic frenzy of the chase scenes and the powerful performances by the likes of Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron throw you into an exhilarating thrill ride that you will want to see again and again and again. For a summer lineup that is packed with overloaded CGI reboots like Fantastic Four and Jurassic World, it is so refreshing to see the now 70 year old Miller put his money into practical effects work to really give you a visceral and realistic epic.

"May 18, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is in the running for my favorite film of 2015. George Miller returns with a vengeance in a sleek, well-made action movie that blows its competition in the decades since Beyond Thunderdome. He really puts other directors to shame with this movie, showing how powerful a movie can be, especially when it's shot so well and attention to fine details are paid. Most of the film is actually practical effects as well, making it even more impressive. And I didn't begrudge the minor use of CGI at all. It was used sparingly and effectively, as it should be. Unfortunately, it probably won't be appreciated by modern audiences who can't tell the difference or don't care. It's also good that they didn't try and re-tell Max's backstory, or try to make him the central character. He hasn't been that since the first film, and is always just there to be a part of the world as a whole. Bottom line: Fury Road is a masterpiece, and one of the most engaging action movies in years.",NEUTRAL

"May 18, 2015","I loved it. No pretense; no BS; all action - with a point or two that holds it all together, beginning to end. It combines any motorheads dream of perversely beautiful 16-, 8-, 4- and 2-wheelers with just the right amount of isolated humanity in the leads with weird diabolical evil-doers trying to capture a handful of gorgeous or pregnant nubiles. Spirituality comes from the search for redemption Charlize represents, with salt and pepper romantic tension with Max.  But the motorized action in symbolic landscapes adds the critical gestalt to the movie making it almost an allegory on the age-old theme of survival in search of a purpose, vulnerabilty and bravery overcoming destruction and madness.  Cool!, I say.  I'm going to gather a few friends and go see it again.

"May 18, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road, the return of George Millers explosive imagination is back in full swing, without loosing an ounce of elegance, rage, or heart. The way Fury Road ties in with the original Mad Max films is incredible in its own regards. The film not only stays true to the original three films, but adds to them--making the most recent installment the most relevant the series has ever been. The droughts in California, the always-growing topic of feminism, these are all current and important issues that are woven into the concept of Fury road in a clever and often brilliant manner. The most badass character in the entire movie possibly ends up being Imperator Furiosa, played by a revved up, stunning Charlize Theron. The journey starts right away; causing two heroic characters, Max and Furiosa, to collide in a smart and descriptive manner. Their relationship is unique; both trapped in this insane earth, forced to believe that everyone around them is sane. That idea did not sink in fast however. after glazing at the movies shock factor for the first hour, my eyes began to see the film in a new light. It instantly turned from an expensive, exquisite summer blockbuster, into something much more thoughtful. The idea soon became a horror; almost a warning to us as humans. The concept of Fury Road is more shocking than a Mad Max film has ever been, and it totally works. The classic villain, the hero, Nux, and all of the incredible female leads fits the new installment of Mad Max right into the history books, as what will prove to be one of the most cherished action films of our generation. Now, many classics are flawed, and mad max is no exception. The beginning kicks off the film in a queesy and mind throbbing manner, and may turn away some impatient viewers. But once you are fully submerged into the flames of Fury Road, it is an experience to remember. The car crashes are staged to perfection, the music is emotionally compelling, and the character development- left and right- is thrilling; these are creative characters, and thoughtful ones, too. They all have their own backstory, which makes Fury Road such a one of a kind summer blockbuster. This is a senior director, at his best. This is a director who built over what he once created-- setting flame to the movie screens with a fueled, grim, and intensely vivid snapshot of his imagination. Mad Max: Fury Road, all in all, is the most anyone could have asked for with a two hour follow up to the punk-inspired series. Its mean, very explosive, and unexpectedly heartfelt; exactly what the film had to be to allow George Millers epic legacy to maintain a beyond perfect reputation.",NEUTRAL

I can best describe this film as a carnival in a foreign country where nobody speaks your language and everyone is a little too weird. Its a fantastic film with brilliant visuals and sound production. Its typical of good summer block buster but the story is also engaging for this dystopian epic. Even though the film is based in a vast desert landscape you feel as though the characters are trapped in bottle that is humanities fouls. I highly recommend this film for any fan of something big, loud and satisfying.",NEUTRAL

"May 18, 2015","Mad Max is set in a gritty post apocalyptic world, where water is scarce and women are treated like property.

He is freed when Nux and the War Boys go chasing after Furiosa who has freed the warlords wives. Max crosses paths with the women and over time assists on the escape. 

This movie has it all action, drama and car chases. The stunts were all practical and hardly any CG was used. They built all the cars you see in the movie. Tom Hardy and most of the cast did a bulk of their own stunts.

Visually it was incredible between the action, the cinematography, the costumes and the cars. Charlize Theron was incredible as Furiosa. Tom Hardy was quiet and brooding as Max. Nicholas  Hoult's character Nux was emotionally compelling.

This movie was fun in a way I haven't experienced in a theater in decades.  Its a ram air supercharged dystopian steampunk demolition derby on steroids that somehow introduces characters that you give a damn about.  And it is all played out on a breathtaking cinematic canvas like a 4th of July finale.  I saw this in Real 3D, and I highly recommend doing the same.",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2015","Mad Max:Fury Road! Mad Max was directed by George Miller and was a little disapointing in some ways for me, but i still enjoyed it and thought it was good. i am going to talk about the positives. Tom Hardy was cool, the action was spectacular, the film looked amazing, the special and visual effects were outstanding and the score was great and really matched the movie! Alot of great stunt work from Tom Hardy and the cast. Now i will be getting into the negative side of this film. I liked Tom Hardy as Max but... He didn't really add alot to this movie. Yes he had the great scene of him trying to steal a truck from a group of women then failing but like he didn't have character, and i bareley cared about him. Same as all the other characters, i didn't like the other characters, in fact i could bareley take them seriously. The best part of this movie for tom hardy was probably the beginning when he was getting chased by all these pale people, and it was creepy as shit, and i didn't want Max to get caught by those guys, but after he did get caught by those men, i didnt care about max or any other characters. I don't even understand what the plot really is, because it was literally pretty much action the whole time. there is nothing wrong with that but it just gets a little bit old when you see some pale white dude with a fucked up face playing a flamethrower guitar. like what?! anyways, it just had character flaws and story flaws that i expected alot more from due to all the hype. I was a little disapointed considering this has a 98 on RT but its whatever, it was good, just not as good as i thought! i still had a good time with Mad Max and i guess i could reccomend it to some people, but i feel like it isn't for everyone, but apparently it is for everyone considering since everyone literally says its amazing, but i still liked it!",NEUTRAL

From Transformers to Avengers, every scene feels as if it was planned and rehearsed by actors with ping pong balls attached to their tights in front of giant green screens.  And the entire point of seeing those movies is to be in awe of what computers can do now? no thanks.  In 1981 I saw the Road Warrior on VHS. I must have hit the rewind button 10 times to figure out if the stunts were real or not.  THAT is how you made a great movie.  Michael Bay needs to take notes on Fury Road. The scenes were so epic. So large. So thrilling. So REAL.  I went in to this movie looking for CGI. I found a little bit here and there. But the fuel, and oil, and gasoline and fire were too big, to real to be missed!  The plot is good. The action is UNMATCHED. You will not see another movie like this the entire year, maybe the entire decade. Let's hope I'm wrong and the next Transformers has less computers and more action sequences like the opening before the credits! This movie grabs you from the very beginning and doesn't let go.

The practical effects are top notch and the visuals for the most part subtle although there were a few dodgy moments. While the movie is called Mad Max he kinda takes a back seat to Charllize Theron who has not been this good in a long time. She is a bonafide movie star. Tom Hardy is a little subdued in the lead and does not have the charisma of Gibson but is good nonetheless. If your looking for a good time at the cinema this week look no further than this.,NEUTRAL

Mad Max Fury Road features another sublime performance by Tom Hardy as Max, and perhaps not since Sigourney Weaver in 1986 Aliens has there been such an indelible female hero as Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa! The film is full of smart spectacular dramatic action that makes current recent films seem anemic, puny or even illogical in their own constructed universes. (I am thinking of you Avengers Age of Ultron, and you Furious 7.) If anyone would look at the trailer and think the film looks bonkers, they would be correct, it is spectacularly bonkers, fast, and intense, with sprinklings of humor.. A chase film from beginning to end that never lags. Set in a dystopia future where the powerful command the weak by their control of scarce resources (water, food, gas.) the look of the film is unique and perhaps off putting. The story while packed with violence and action is never sadistic. Think instead to a straight forward Western where the black hat villains and the white hat good guys are quite clearly portrayed as what they are; and that even the young soldiers who seek glory in battle at the service of the overlord villain can be redeemed with a little change in their perspective.Obvious thought has gone into the story of Mad Max Fury Road, yet it does not steep itself in profound themes or statements, rather it is profound in how entertaining and skillful an action film still can be. Great movie!",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2015","Mad Max, like the Franken-cars that are its soul, is pieced together from exactly the number of moving parts required to make it fast, loud and exhilarating. Â It's a master class of streamlined efficiency and a testament to what expert craftsmen can produce when their passions are indulged.

It's packed so thick with gorgeous cinematography and vehicular insanity that its finer points -- Charlise Theron's smoldering intensity, a feminist message that's never peachy and a thundering, propulsive soundtrack -- work on an almost subconscious level. Â Which is good, cause your brain's gonna need all its processing power to wrap itself around Fury Road's poetic chaos.

The characters and lore within the world of Mad Max are unique enough to stand out, but remain grounded in an ounce of realism. This, coupled with amazingly choreographed action sequences, makes Mad Max a welcome addition to the foray of action flicks.

Apparently there is a fuel war going on, but you wouldn't know it because everyone on God's sand yellow earth goes through 50 gallons in less than a minute! The obscene rating of this movie by critics and the public dilutes true craftsmanship of movie making and product. This can only be explained by taking a look at the quality of movies this year.

"May 18, 2015","Review by Jesse Burleson of VIEWS ON FILM


In the mid-1980's, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior represented the first time I ever saw a movie on VHS. No joke. There I was, taking in the existential, catastrophic splendor and thrusted into a funky, eclectic world that only director George Miller could deposit me in. I was also taken aback by the aura of star Mel Gibson. He didn't say much. He just drove the big rig and gave any punk rocker delinquent the business (via a veritable, sawed-off shotgun). When the announcement that a new installment was on the horizon (some thirty years later), it was also predicated on the fact that Australia's favorite son be omitted from the lead role. Brit Tom Hardy who seems to be everywhere these days, got to inhabit the driver's seat (ha-ha). The question on every moviegoer's mind is can he fill the shoes of ""mad"" Mel? The answer is, it doesn't matter. Mad Max: Fury Road isn't entirely about the character of Max Rockatansky. And Hardy for what it's worth, only possesses about a smidgen of Melle Mel's ear to the grindstone screen presence. For practical purposes though, he'll do and so will the movie. Its plot is slight yet there are action sequences providing enough scorched antics and kinetic motion to make your eyes shoot through the back of your head. We're talking apocalypse now more than ever.

Historically, George Miller has been in charge of every Mad Max movie since their franchised inception back in 1979. He takes everything that made those films work and ratchets it up a few more notches here. His world in ""Fury Road"", is made up of caricatures that for the most part, are funkier, nastier, and much more repugnant. This is imagination outside five boxes. The look is more modern too. Cinematographer John Seale (he shot The Tourist) harbors a canvas that is ablaze, drenched, and vehemently dusty. It's like a sunburn that eventually turns golden brown. As for storytelling sensibilities, well they are fashioned less than in all three of the previous outings combined. The script is the product of more than one writer and you think to yourself, ""did it need that many?"" In truth, there's not a whole lot of dialogue anyway and I suppose whatever amount is messaged to the audience, well it probably comes off as concealed. No matter. I honestly don't go to Mad Max movies for the account. I want to view what Roger Daltrey sang about (that would be the tune by The Who called ""Let's See Action""). Granted, this 2015 release has enough pyrotechnics, villainy, and aerodynamic exertion for ten movies (with what seems like almost no CGI). I hope the stuntmen got paid handsomely because they work some serious overtime.

Now the last thirty minutes of Mad Max: Fury Road are a masterpiece all in itself. They make the flick better than it really is or even has a right to be. You gotta use your utmost imagination or just think Raiders of the Lost Ark on anabolic steroids. What precludes is an extended chase sequence with enough semi trucks and other motorized vehicles to overrun the city of Detroit. There is violence in nature here and acrobatic candour that simply wears you out.

So who is this all attributed to? Well director George Miller of course and at age 70, he is one feisty fellow. This dude is like the Martin Scorsese of action directors because of his starry-eyed energy that's blatantly possessed. He hadn't made a Mad Max film since 1985 so you know that he had a lot of time to subjugate his newest vision. My thinking is that he might have checked out 1995's Waterworld to mirror the costume design, or to polish things up a bit, or even to add some new angles (there are shots in ""Fury Road"" where the villainous malefactors are off in the distance and you know that danger is coming. It reminded me of said film so sue me). His premise is in short doses and it intervenes between periods of metal-geared rubble and heavy metal stage prog.

You have of course, Max (Tom Hardy). He's an Australian prisoner and a man who's held captive while being used for upside down blood donation. Then there's Imperator Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron in the token, female badass role). She's a War Rig driver who is helping five wives escape from breeding slavery. Finally, we have Nux (played by Nicolas Hoult who reminded me of the Gyro Captain from The Road Warrior). He's a sick War Boy and needs a large amount of ichor to go on surviving. That's all I'm gonna reveal. Just know that all of these souped-up characters are in some way, connected. Now your job is to buy a ticket, get strapped in, and let the chaos and upheaval simply spill onto the screen.

In conclusion, this film has garnered four stars from many of the nation's critics. I myself enjoyed it but I'm scratching my head to figure where all the enormous praise came from. Here's how I chalked up my rating. I gave Mad Max: Fury Road three and a half stars for the audacious, relentless suspense and two and a half stars for the razor thin narrative. That results in a solid dose of action-adventure fare but not something that's catered to magnum opus territory. Regardless, this is still a ""road"" worth taking. There are no exits, no stop lights, and the aspect of no passing lanes is irrelevant. To quote Nicolas Hoult's albino, cracked-lipped Nux, ""what a day, what a lovely day!"" Natch.",NEUTRAL

I mean I'm not sure I get the point of the whole dang movie, but who cares?  I thought what Fast and Furious 7 did with cars was impressive, but Mad Max goes another step further.

"May 18, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is a weird, stylish, weird, action-packed, weird, cool movie! There are so many great performances in this film. Tom Hardy continues to be awesome. Charlize Theron also turned in a powerful performance, along with Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne back from the original Mad Max, and, possibly the stealer of the show, iOTA as the Doof Warroir, a.k.a. the guitar guy. But one of my absolute favorite thing about this movie was the wonderful mix of practical effects with CG. There is something special about actual, ridiculously designed cars getting torn to bits and exploded in the most glorious fireballs and seeing that mixed with a beautifully rendered sandstorm. Director George Miller proves that he hasn't lost a step by creating one of the best examples of how to return to a dormant franchise in epic fashion. Fury Road is a movie that reminds me why I love the cinema. It is a completely unique experience that is unlike anything that has come out of Hollywood in years.",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2015","""Mad Max,"" ""Road Warrior,"" ""Beyond Thunderdome."" With those three pictures, filmmaker George Miller gave moviegoers in the 1980s a glimpse of a post-apocalyptic future - bone dry, violent and populated by biker gangs gone ballistic. Then he spent 30 years making really sweet movies, like ""Babe: Pig In The City"" and ""Happy Feet.""
Well, now in a Space of 2 Hours, 70 Year old George Miller refined what it meant to watch a Hardcore Action Movie for this Century - sadly without a sensible storyline or a proper actor taking the helm as its lead actor - with the reboot of ""Mad Max: Fury Road.""
Lets start with the Storyline first.
The storyline - for all its sensibility and simplicity - could be summarized as follows -
1) The good guys escape from Point A to Point B fighting off everyone who come in their path.
2) After they reach Point B - they decide - Oh Well - this is a bad idea.
3) So then they decide to go back - from Point B to Point A - and once again fight and kill everyone who come in their path.
Now Lets Zone Out.
Right from the get go - without wasting any time, the movie builds up into a raw blood thirsty high-octane gorgeous, scrap metal demolition derby of a popcorn picture.
Which is not bad.
However, it too much. Too much. Too Much.
Too Much to the point it overshadows everything else.
The overdose of over-the-top action scenes start assaulting your senses with such fervor that after sometime you start getting exhausted with numbness rather than excitement. And at some point you would want to stop, take a breather and wonder - what exactly is going on here?
Had it not been for the powerful presence of Charlize Theron (Imperator Furiosa) and Hugh Keays-Byrne (Immortan Joe) - Tom Hardy with his Stone-faced zombie like expression would have made this movie into a disaster. Seriously - he gave us better emotional expressions with his mask covering his whole face when he played Bane in Batman than as Max Rockatansky.
But lets be nice here.
Not everything in the movie was that bad.
The stuntwork to the cinematography, sound design, set design and music was truly breath-taking. Audiences were dragged into this beautiful, dystopian nightmare world from the get-go, which kept us intrigued and immersed throughout.
The cars and costumes and crazy stunts were truly magnificent.
Director George Miller also brought in the cool rides - Jeeps that look like porcupines, what appeared to be a '59 Cadillac mounting a monster truck. Also, a rig with an electric guitarist strapped to the front with the guitar belching fire - now that was really cool.
I also loved the religious fervor of the War Boys, their faces sprayed with shiny chrome paint, their devotion to Immortan Joe and devout belief in a warlike afterlife - which was a rather strange yet commendable twist in the whole plot.
And how can I forget to praise the Stunt Performers - who worked with real rigs rather than computer effect?!?!
Those pole riders who kept swaying high above the action - hired from Cirque du Soleil gave the movie its realism that was truly required.
So then - why did I not like this movie?
Here is my list of what I hated about the movie.
Point 1:
The Storyline - There is none. It just senseless, mindless and pointless action.
Point 2:
Tom Hardy - Seriously - Why??? Why??? Why???
Mel Gibson was truly the best Mad Max that was ever made and created. But Tom Hardy was a disaster for this role.
Point 3:
'Fury Road's' ending is too neat and tidy. To some degree, Max did save the day in the end. But Furiosa survives. She brings her people home to the promised land. All but one of Immortan Joe's wives survive also. Too Vanilla for its own good.
Loy Machedo's Moment of Truth
Given that we're living in shallow times where people celebrate style over substance, it will probably end up a huge hit and as a cult classic much like the original. At its core, Mad Max: Fury is nothing more than an expensive, overlong B-movie with A-list actors.

"May 18, 2015","This is what summer movies should be like: Fun with Substance 
This is a true masterpiece, and excellent action movie
This is not Transformers, this is not fast & furious, This is a vey well made action film.
This is a very simple but powerful story about redemption and freedom. 
The script is very well written.
The Editing is excellent, the music is OUTSTANDING.
The Action is absolutely Fantastic, Real Action and real stunts, you really feel like you are watching real action and real people not some CGI crap (transformers, fast & furious).
George Miller Proves that action films do not need to be filled with CGI, he directs action in a way that makes you at the edge of your seat, but the man is not just about action, the way he directs his actors shows how much he cares about his work.
Everyone Gave Great performances,  Tom Hardy is great as always, Nicholas Hoult is really good, even Rosie Huntington gave an excellent performance, but Charlize Theron steals every scene she's in, This is the best performance i have ever seen for her.
I Cant Recommend this movie enough, This Film & Last year's Edge of Tomorrow are the best action films  I have seen in a very long time,

"May 18, 2015","Easily the best movie I have seen in years. A movie that is straight-up in your face action, with so much subtlety that every detail of the story could be clearly understood.",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2015","Ok what just happened to me, I just finished watching Mad Max that's what! 

(Disclaimer: when ordering tickets make sure you pronounce ""Fury Road"" as in ""Nick Fury from avengers"" and not ""fury"" as in ""wow this puppy is really Fury"" you will get zero laughs and make an enemy for life)

I've never seen the Mel Gibson version as they are recognised as pants and Mel Gibson is a one man Reich! 

But have you ever watched a car chase and been like ""man I hope this lasts two and half more hours"" because if you did they boy have I got s film for you!

Mad max is played out in a Future ravaged by nuclear war and only Australians and English people have survived in the sand! But it's not a fun beach party. Weird old skeletor man and his baby with a beard (yep) have all the water and won't give it all to the poor people, as he intends to keep it along with all of the breast milk he can bottle (admittedly a business idea I once had when chemically intoxicated). 

Max is captured because....(insert reason here) and is emotionally finger blasted into sadness and turned into an unwilling blood donor (bit of shady move Max people need blood). 

So Charlize Theron steals a massive tanker full of petrol and brides (yep brides) and runs away. She is then chased by skeletor and minions including a very dry looking Nicholas Hoult! With Ol Max strapped to the front of his car. Max becomes the titular ""Mad"" at this situation and escapes and nicks the big truck and drives off with brides and fuel. 

The rest of the film is a massive chase across the sandy lands very reminiscent of ""stop the pigeon"" except the pigeon is a giant Tanker of fuel and Betrothed ladies driven by Irate Maximillion! (I believe this would've been too long a title for a Saturday cartoon) 

All of the actors in this were superb, all very weird! From the old granny lesbian colony all the way to Ol Grump Max himself! There's even one lady who constantly shows nipples through her shirt for the whole movie! No one is kind enough in this desolate world to give her a heads up though. 

I would recommend this film to anyone who would like to try a big bag of cocaine without actually doing drugs! Solid and so much fun!",NEUTRAL

The part is perfect for Hardy, because there's not much talking, but Hardy is not perfect for the role--I think it needed someone with a bit more charisma. Nevertheless, it's great.",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2015","Up until the end of the sandstorm I was ready to just write ""Holy fuck"" here, give it 9/10 and leave it at that. Unfortunately it sags pretty heavily in the middle, to the point of boredom, honestly, and also, what the hell was with Hoult's character arc? That was supremely dumb and unconvincing.

"May 18, 2015","If you're a Mad Max vet, this film is for you.

This film basically uses the best elements from it's previous entries and puts them into a full scale action sequence.

Fury Road is unapologetic, surreal, and awesome. Everything that could have had real potential in Beyond Thunderdome is here, without the silly-ness and Hollywood grandeur. It still keeps its charms of Mad Max and the Road Warrior with a symphony of violent and beautiful sequences. Hell it's hard to call them individual sequences when the movie is constantly in motion almost at all times.

Charlize Theron and Max entertain, excite, and won't bore you with societal semantics or reasoning, they won't talk too much and destroy the violent fanfare this movie is. If you're invested in the franchise, and love the primarily non-verbal experience, you'll love this film. Hell Nicholas Hoult and the fleeing wives, provide plenty for visual and emotional heft, with the limited amount of actual time to revel in it.

Go Watch it, skip Furious 7.",NEUTRAL

The film's excellent direction and editing does all the work for him in developing his character. Theron stealing the show too much? Oh, who cares? She was incredible as Furiosa and earned the show.

"May 18, 2015","Oh what a day! What a LOVELY day!

Director George Millar returns over 30 years later to add a new story to his original Mad Max trilogy. But this sequel, fitting right in with all the previous entries, pushes the already full throttle franchise to near-biblical proportions. Mad Max: Fury Road is an epic race of humanity versus the utterly insane, and it is stunningly beautiful, a visual feast indeed. Every aspect of it is over the top fun. From its color palette to its extreme costume and mechanical styling, this is definitely a modern day opera.

The landscape is empty and bleak, like a blank orange canvas being splattered with white zombie torsos and spiked hedgehog cars. I've never actually wanted to be inside of a dust storm until now. I have never wanted dirt in my mouth as much as I did watching this movie. To be in the thick of all the parched craziness, it's a testament to the visual designers of this film that such extremely hot and dry conditions look gorgeously appealing.

As the dust kicks up and the action starts, Fury Road will not let you forget that this franchise is best known for its car chase scenes. If you're a car person, this movie will absolutely make you lose your mind. But if you're not a car person, well... This movie will still make you lose your mind. The high octane, high speed action here is unreal. It's all just absurd, in the best possible way. These scenes are so engrossing that they sweep you right into them, and just when you think it couldn't possibly push any further, it does. This is like watching Gods fight, which is fitting as the film has an overall mythological feel to it. By the time the very first car chase scene ends, you've already been taken on several loops and thrown to the ground, left to ask yourself ""What did I just watch?!"" And that's just the first one, all while fully establishing our main characters.

The cast is absolutely on point. Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky is a great succession to Mel Gibson: quiet and strong but still growing madder and madder after all these years on his never ending Odyssey. Nicholas Hoult is quite inspired as Nux. He's feral and tasty, both sour and sweet. The true strength of the film's characters, though, comes in a different form.

The women of Fury Road are more than just pretty faces. In fact, they are extremely important to the survival of anyone in this film. They are mothers, wives, daughters and sisters. They plant the seeds of life. They offer the milk of growth and strength. They release the waters to replenish. They are goddesses. The core group of women here, whose perfect supermodel bodies are covered in only wispy pure white cloth, are furies not to be reckoned with. They are sirens and they are oracles and they will certainly be the end of you.

Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa is the leader these women need. She's ruthless and does want needs to be done to get the job done. At the same time, she's haunted and not without heart. She's the female equivalent of Max himself, only better. Even Max realizes he wouldn't make it without her and it is a wonder to watch these two work together.

They are aided by Junkie XL's down right dirty score. It sounds grimy and savage in itself, with a harsh drum line and textured electronics. If you could get the musical equivalent of rust brushing against itself in an epic thematic score, this is pretty much it.

It doesn't get much better than this, as far as action flicks go. This is George Miller's masterpiece. With all the high profile movies coming out in the remainder of this year, I'm already calling Mad Max: Fury Road my movie of the year. I would be thoroughly surprised to see any other sequel or remake coming have this much style, originality and symbolism ingrained into such strong characters.

His name is Max and his movie is brilliant.",NEUTRAL

"May 18, 2015","This was a pleasant surprise for me. I wasn't the least bit impressed by the trailers and thought they looked very stupid. I suppose I went into this film with extremely low expectations and that helped.

I was riveted from the opening shot till the end. This is such a strange and perverse universe George Miller has crafted and yet, you could see how everything seems rather logical if viewed totally from the confines of this perverse universe that Miller has crafted. Therein lies the beauty of this film for me. 

And it was surprisingly entertaining. Nice tension that built up over the film with barely any dialogue. The film's dynamics are formed from the intense action sequences and the relationships explored through the actions of the protagonists and antagonists. Here, Miller shows us that films should show and not tell. Though this is taken to an extreme in his movie. 

This scenes in this movie are beautifully crafted even though most scenes are shot in the desert. The editing, choice of shots, the lighting and the soundtrack all work to make this outing of Mad Max work. Be prepared to be entertained.",NEUTRAL

"May 17, 2015","From the moment Mad Max: Fury Road the white knuckle ride to hell and back commences and it never lets up for a second. An obvious parody of the Islamic State death cult, the soldiers are promised Valhalla when they die and fast cars while they live. The best looking females are used for breeding purposes and the peasants are deprived of all but the bare necessities. Poor old Max is a captive from the start and, apparently used as a blood bank while Imperator Furiosa, played admirably by Charlize Theron, appears to be Queen Bee amongst the local heroes and assorted psychos. I suppose the plot-line matters little but suffice it to say their are goodies and baddies and various shades of grey who all enhance the action. The special effects are fantastic and the Circus Soleil style theatrics are simply spectacular, What dialogue there is can hardly be heard but that really doesn't matter much because Shakespeare it aint! Certainly like nothing else I have ever seen although Tom Hardy, one of my favourite actors who was brilliant in The Drop, merely has to flex his muscles and look very pissed off to be the perfect Max.",NEUTRAL

Mad Max wasn't even the star in this. Charlize Theron's character was. He barely even spoke. He made Rocky seem like an articulate Rhodes Scholar. It's not like I want to watch the English Patient.

"May 17, 2015","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a post-apocalyptic thriller by director George Miller about a society of bloodthirsty scavengers living in a desert wasteland after society blows itself up. The overlord is able to keep his subjects at bay because he provides them with sustenance and water, which has become a rare commodity. One of his lieutenants (Charlize Theron) defects and takes a harem of women from him he is using for breeding and kidnaps them. A renegade drifter (Tom Hardy) gets caught up in the morass and teams up with Theron to try to find a place that is rumored to have sustenance called the Green Place. Having never seen a Mad Max film, I cannot profess to compare it to others, but this film is definitely gritty and over the top and is a cross between Dune and grindhouse films. I enjoyed the sheer adrenaline rush of the car chases and the non-stop, riveting action. The film is very campy and this integrates nicely into the action scenes. This film is not for the faint of heart, and the viewer will just be in awe at the visual splendor of effects and the environmental obstacles the team encounters. The film does not hold your hand and expects you to be quick on the uptake of the details, or they will elude you.

I've also never seen a movie more packed with pregnant sex slaves but I'll leave that to feminists to mull over lol. I loved them.
max remains an awesome character.. he hasn't been watered down in the least. he's just as nihilistic.. and even crazier than the max of the previous three films. he is not above lying or sacrificing other protagonists to survive. a true anti-hero. not good  not bad. his only goal is to survive. 
other than him, who we know, every other character is a blank who's filled in by their actions as the story progresses. brilliant characterizations! from each sex slave to the slave boy who gets high on chrome spray paint to the old broa-- but I don't wana give that away. 

Charlize Theron's character is no Ripley or Sarah Connor - there's no time for that! but she does hold her own and kicks ass. 

Mad Max's post apocalytpic world is as sharply drawn as ever ..  believable.. but also mysterious because not everything is explained ad nauseum. as a viewer you have to figure it out by the cryptic phrases uttered, and by the incredible detail in the background of all the establishing shots and the sheer creativity of the vehicles and the production design. repeated viewings im sure would draw out more. 

in terms of action movies this year I've seen godzilla, furious7, avengers: age of ultron and mad max: fury road. 

fury road CLOBBERS them all. it's no contest. the others come off like inept student films compared to it. 70yo director George Miller has UTTERLY HUMILIATED every other action director working today. this may be the greatest ""mic drop"" in the history of cinema. follow this, you bitches!

"May 17, 2015","Finally an action movie that doesn't rely on explosions, and eye candy (looking at you Michael Bay). Graced with great acting from the cast, Tom Hardy fills the role of the enigmatic 'Max' perfectly..badass and all. The vagabond who finds himself in the middle of things and reluctantly helps to save the day...just so he can have enough gas for his car. The villan, while still being a gas desired maniac, is fresh and ever so evil..not to mention frieghtening and is a formidable oppenent to the ass-kicking Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who simply wants to get away from him, while helping some others along the way. The score was enthralling, the scenes were heart pounding, the costumes/makeup were ever so fitting, and the story was incredible.

Mad Max Fury Road is a feast to the eye and to the heart and mind as well, in between all the car chases and the amazing set pieces there's a very clear message and social commentary about the society we live in and what in reality one day might happen if we don't change our ways of living.

"May 17, 2015","Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best action films I've seen in a long, long time. George Miller is back with Mad Max after Beyond The Thunder Dome which was 30 years ago. Directors who usually return to a franchise who started it don't end up really good. Some examples are George Lucas for Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Or Steven Spielberg for Indiana Jones 4. But George Miller proves that he can bring a franchise back to life. This is probably one of the best action films of the summer so far. Tom Hardy as Max did a fine job but Charlize Theron as Furiosa is amazing. Her character kicked some major ass. The story was also great and it was very simple. It's just getting from point A to point B. The action was amazing and there wasn't any of that shaky cam. George Miller's direction is amazing because he uses some wide shots which looks amazing. The movie is also very intense I also felt hot while I was watching this movie because it takes place in a desert like area. I really loved how much of the action was done practical because today action films do CGI for touch shots but in this film it was all done with practical effects which made it feel real. This film isn't for everyone. The film is very weird and crazy which most people can't take. If your a Mad Max fan you'll enjoy the hell out of this film. Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best films this summer and one of my favorite films this year.

"May 17, 2015","High octane for about 90-95% of the film. Would have liked to have had 10-15 mins dedicated to Max's back story, but I understand that it is not a reboot. Was not bothered by the feminist angle near the end of the film and I also felt that many of the critics got it wrong about Max (Hardy) taking a backseat to Furiosa (Theron) and that is one of the strong points of the film and that was both characters got to shine in the action sequences.

Speaking of the action sequences, it was great to see this type of action film making once again. The scenes were perfectly shot and the stunts were magnificent. Also, major kudos to the cinematographer because the landscapes in this film really enhanced the action.  The 98% rating by the critics was warranted.

No fim fica a sensação de estar faltando algo. Penso que quiseram ser ousados ao mostrar uma grávida morrendo com bebê e tudo, mas isso é tão comum no noticiário que pra mim foi apenas mais uma morte. Me senti como o cara do filme balançando o cordão umbilical como quem brinca com um barbante. Ah ok, ela morreu. Mas tudo bem, não construiram o personagem o suficiente para que me importasse com ela. Inédito foi que o personagem principal não é bem o principal, Furiosa é o Max no filme, ela que se rebela, ela dirige, atira e mata o vilão no final.

"May 17, 2015","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the action movie I've been waiting to see in my five years of film reviewing.  I haven't been waiting around in agony like a Southern belle longing for her Rhett Butler - I have, instead, been continuously leaving the theaters of various actioners pleasantly charmed.  But thrills, yes, thrills, have been kept at a minimum.  Sure, it's fun to see CGI, likable actors, and bombastic set pieces mix it up with the delirium of a succulent martini.  Yet, these days, action movies seem serviceable, great for two hours but not for much else.  They don't stick with you: you end up ranking their greatness in the scheme of other films in their franchise.  Immediately after ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" last year, for instance, my sister and I spent most of the ride home arguing about whether it was better than the original ""Avengers"", hardly talking about what we liked about it, what made it such a success.
	I can't really complain about the current state of action, though.  I liked ""The Avengers 2"".  I thought ""Furious 7"" contained some seriously spectacular car chases.  But missing from them is a sense of originality.  As they exist in a sort of ""real world"", as the characters are familiar, as the good cop/bad cop dynamic is predictable, we're there more out of obligation to the franchise.  As the years go by, a sameness is setting in.
	The minute I grabbed a seat for ""Fury Road"" last night, I didn't know what to expect.  The first three ""Mad Max"" movies, ending thirty years ago with the imaginative ""Beyond Thunderdome"", were cynical explosions of dystopian disaster, where the mindset is kill or be killed and the lead character, the titular Max, isn't so much a hero as he is a wounded guy trying to survive.  The ""Mad Max"" movies are so seminal because the action is so unforced: the remaining population is so willing to slaughter for the final drops of gasoline to propel their decked out vehicles that the films may as well be called Mad Max vs. The World.  No one is ever, ever safe.  You can count on Max to survive, but you can't bet that the world will be a better place after he fends off his latest opponent.  Fiery and desolate, the balmy lands of the post-apocalyptic future are never much of a haven.  Max isn't a hero, rather a man who can work a gun and a car and who seems to constantly be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
	""Fury Road"" has been called a reboot of the original franchise, but reboot seems too plain a word.  Reboot suggests laziness, a ""RoboCop"" no one's in the mood for.  With the same director at the helm, George Miller, ""Fury Road"" is a reawakening, a rollicking continuation, and a startling return to form.  Certainly, it is the most brutal of all the ""Mad Max"" films, not for the screeching sissies of the population.  But it is also among the finest action movies in the history of cinema.  We have been able to stomach superheroes smashing goons into the buildings of New York City, probably killing hundreds of civilians in the process, for so long - here, consequences are really consequences.  The characters are vulnerable, however heroic or villainous they may be, and the action sequences produce just as much of a thrill as they do a shudder.  For once, something humane in us lights when someone gets crushed by a mountainous vehicle.
	Tom Hardy, replacing Mel Gibson, portrays Max Rockatansky, a loner deep in the Australian outback attempting to hide from the dangers of the recent collapse of civilization.  Only a few minutes into ""Fury Road"" is he kidnapped by the War Boys, the henchman of the tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who leads and controls a strenuous territory with a massive water source.  The War Boys are essentially half-dead young men - Max, in response, is provided as a ""blood bag"" for the sickly Nux (Nicholas Hoult).  
	Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), an ally of Joe, takes off on her war rig to collect gasoline from a nearby pipeline.  But after driving off road, it becomes clear that she has something else in mind: she has brought Joe's five wives along with her, who act as his means of breeding. So a chase ensues, the nefarious foes close behind.  Max and Furiosa finally meet when Nux catches up to the rig - and a partnership is formed.  Left is a series of car stunts, tour-de-force performances, imaginative cinematography, and a feel-up of a dystopian society refreshing among a sea of ones filled with sexy teens and Hunger Games.
	I have no doubt that ""Fury Road"" will repel many paying customers.  The film is so bleak, so action-packed, so barbarous, so bloody, so disturbing, so wholly original that something conventional and thoroughly PG-13 will suit some people much better.  I, opposite of some of the lightweights out there, was thrilled not only by ""Fury Road""'s action, but also by Miller's visionary handling of it all.  I could gush for several more paragraphs, but that would be an entirely different essay, perhaps an article appreciating its artistic achievements.
	Immortan Joe's territory, along with his look and his War Boys, is a triumph in hellacious fear.  Simply gazing upon his lair, his parched population, instills terror in us.  He is one of the most frightening villains in recent action movies, but is it because there isn't much to him besides uncompromising evil? 
	The aesthetic of ""Fury Road"" is something of a punky, raging pulp novel: cars are covered in metal spikes, guns are an extension of the arms of the characters.  Night scenes are drowned in a cerulean blue, the days a ferocious orange; bullets, eye patches, and skulls aren't simply decor - they're part of the landscape, as natural as the air, as the dirt.  Even part of Joe's entourage is an electric guitar player, who strums whenever shit is about to go down.  These touches may be laughed at by some, but as a part of Miller's vision, they're something of a wonder.
	And while the film may include the name Mad Max in its title, Furiosa is the hero of ""Fury Road"", and the female action hero we've all been waiting for.  Long gone are the busty Black Widows and Lara Crofts: with her metallic placeholder for an arm, oil warpaint, bald head as a stab at gender reversal, she is an embodiment of zeroed in anger.  Theron's performance is, by turns, explosive and vulnerable.  You won't be forgetting Furiosa any time soon.
	You can disagree with me all you want, but ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the best action movie of the decade.  Before you completely write this statement off the map, though, consider this: what was the last action movie that really surprised you, really slapped you around and didn't ask if you wanted to take a five minute smoke break? This is visionary filmmaking, action or otherwise.",NEUTRAL

This thing is overflowing with so much style and awesome perverted weirdness that it makes you question WHY studios stopped making action films like this.
It's one of those RARE occasions where you can throw the script into a wood chipper and still be absolutely blown away.  This movie literally doesn't stop.  It's fast, it's bloody, it's dirty, and it doesn't let up for one moment.  Hell, you could watch this thing on MUTE and still follow everything that's going on.  Which is why i have no problem in saying that this is one of the best Action films i've seen in nearly a decade.  
Does it have flaws?  Sure it does.  But nearly all the flaws are wrapped around the question 'WHY'.  And it doesn't really matter how many flaws there are.  Because all the positive aspects tremendously outweigh any negatives you might have.  Because this is what a TRUE popcorn flick is.  
THIS is what action films should be like.  THIS is how they should be made.  Everything these days is played safe and by the rules.  But we all have a vision.

By:The Movie Guy.

George Miller's crazy intense vision of a post-apocalyptic wasteland returns in Mad Max: Fury Road , the fourth installment of the classic Road Warrior series. On his own in the wasteland & struggling with the demons from his past, former cop turned road warrior, Max (Tom Hardy) is captured to be harvested as a blood donor for a group of pale-skinned, brainwashed minions known as War Boys. The War Boys zealously follow the commands of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), ruler of the lofty Citadel. Immortan Joe controls the supply of food & water distributed to the dirt dwelling ragged masses. He also controls the fertility of a group of woman; ""breeders"" enslaved to bear his children. During a supposed supply run, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), Joeâ(TM)s lieutenant decides to make her escape into the wasteland & return to her birth place which she remembers as the âGreen Placeâ? with several of Joeâ(TM)s prized breeders smuggled out in the armoured war rig she's driving. One of the wives, Splendid (Rosie Huntington-Whitely), is carrying Joe's baby, a very valuable property. Joe & his entire army are soon in hot pursuit of Furiosa. Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a passionate & impressionable follower of Immortan Joe, joins them, hauling Max along for the ride, masked & chained to the front of his vehicle as a portable ""blood bag."" Furiosa leads the army into an epic sandstorm.  Max gains the upper hand on Nax during the battle & attempts to steal the war rig from Furiosa. Forced to join forces to survive, Max, Furiosa & the fugitive Wives struggle to make through harsh terrain & hostile forces to the safety of ""Green Place.""  Mad Max series creator George Miller returns as writer & director with an incredible, high-octane film thatâ(TM)s relentlessly action-packed, & leaving the viewer breathless from beginning to end. 90 percent of the film was done without the use of CGI which makes it amazing to watch those heart-pounding action scenes. The performances from Tom Hardy & Charlize Theron were superb. There is no doubt that Tom Hardy is the right guy to take over the role of Max, first played by Mel Gibson, for a whole new generation. After seeing this film, I found myself watching the three Mad Max films again, Mad Max (1979), Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981), & Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome(1985) just to see how violent those films were compared to this new one which is brutal at times, & also  check out the landscapes & filming style in the previous movies. George Miller remains brilliantly faithful to his vision. You all can take the journey with Max on the Fury Road in 2D, 3D or IMAX 3D. MUST-SEE FILM.",NEUTRAL

This movie is action, pure action. No matter how hard I try I can't think of a scene in which there wasn't well choreographed action. But, it wasn't dumb action there was a strong plot backed up by strong and compelling characters.
Aside from this movie being pure action it is packed with strong performances from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Tom hardy kills it in this role and he only says like 5 lines.

Max - turned into a human blood bag, providing whole blood neck to arm for days?, weeks?, months? even while riding in battle as if it must be continuous without any sense of the many reasons this is impossible.

Everyone mumbles.

Story is less about Max than women; Charlize, mostly driving the movie, rescues 4 other women, and only women, while racing to a paradise seemingly of only women. 
The paradise, not what she remembered, technically, would be incapable of supporting life. 

Multiple octagenarian females fighting and beating warriors standing atop a racing vehicle.

Two hours long, 90% of which is racing one way then reversing while outnumbered and outgunned 20-1 yet surviving then winning. 

Stabbed in the lungs one scene. Charlze stands tall and strong in the next.

"May 17, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road tears the leather off the baseball with a very unexpected and delightful turn from the mainstream of Hollywood movies in 2015.  While its absurdity overshadows much of the film, there is a surprisingly good plot filled with just enough dialogue to actually give this film heft instead of sitting in a theater to watch mindless violence for two hours.

The real bulk of the film lies in the car chases and wheel-based combat; hence the Fury Road.  Pretty much from the opening scene after some exposition from Tom Hardy, the film is basically one long car chase broken up expertly at certain times so as to not completely blow the viewer through their chairs.  

These post-apocalyptic movies always try and explain too heavily how the world got to the point it did, but Fury Road circumvents this by showing rather than telling.  Because that big question isn't really answered in a straightforward manner, and because we never really get a true background story for Max, George Miller puts that part of the movie into our hands to create.

While Tom Hardy is billed as the top actor in the film, and believe me, he's nailed the role of hard-ass with a combination of many of his characters he's played before, Charlize Theron comes out the real star as one-armed Furiosa.  Along with Immorten Joe, who was the original bad guy from the first film but a different character, and Nicolas Hoult as a war boy, this cast is ripe with talent.  

I saw it in 3D, not because I wanted to but because I looked at the wrong times, and it wasn't worth it.  Don't bother.  Catch this in all its glory on a normal screen and you won't be disappointed to rocking out along with the rest of the audience from beginning to end.",NEUTRAL

"May 17, 2015","After all the riotous marketing featuring the word ""MASTERMIND"", George Miller irrefutably proves himself worthy of the title. From start to finish, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is one long chase scene, and the pacing is brilliantly handled. There is no drag, and the story has been woven in a way that both the character development and plot play out fluidly alongside the action, which is a wholly remarkable feat. I hope Michael Bay's seen this picture because Miller pulls off a job that action directors of today NEED to take note of. What of the cast? Well, he's no Mel Gibson but Tom Hardy does pretty well as the titular hero - once again, thrown into a chaotic situation that requires mutual trust for the survival of himself and the innocents around him. Although, his accent still puzzles me... it was some sorta South African, English hybrid that had a tinge of Russian in there every now and then... truly weird stuff but, again, he does well in the role. The real highlight of the film though is Charlize Theron as Imperotar Furiousa. She plays what you could call a ""true"" powerful female-character. And that's NOT because she kicks ass in the movie or is intimidating to watch or because she stands up to oppressive men... no, it's all those things AND the fact that - underneath all the toughness - she possesses a very human amount of heartbreak and fear. These character ""weaknesses"" are of course channeled into her strengths, which makes indeed makes her a strong female-character. This is what needs to go into the composition of any ""strong"" female part. Strong female parts are NOT women who are just another Black Widowish, superheroic ass-kicker that doesn't need a man's help to ""get the job done"", but they are everything that is embodied in Theron's character. So thank you, George Miller, for getting that right. The guy's 70 and he's STILL taking young Hollywood writers and directors to school.",NEUTRAL

"May 17, 2015","Are bad guys too stupid to shoot out tires in the post-apocalyptic future?

Apparently they are.

What this movie did was hi-jack the most thrilling part of ""The Road Warrior,"" the big chase scene, and essentially made that the entire movie. And boy does it get old, loud and boring. Each grotesquely deformed bad-guy drives or races alongside ""Max and the hot girls,"" waiting for their turn to have a grisly CGI death.


I mean, seriously; if felt like the entire movie was made by a committee of teenage boys who all agreed that plots and stories ""are for pussies!"" Their prime directive instead was to make everything be as ""gross, gnarly and uber-violent"" as totally possible! And so that's what we got.


I can't say anymore or I'll spoil what little plot this movie has, but shouldn't a road-trip movie at least go from point A to point B?


There was however a pretty cool CGI haboob that had multiple tornadoes, roaring, groaning and churning inside of it.

It was clear the helicopter cam was used throughout. Just the pure creativity in the design of the cars in this movie is reason enough to see it! Theron and Hardy's acting was excellent...but honestly Hoult simply steals the show with his performance. He truly ""was"" his character. 

The BAD: I feel this movie really could have been 20 to 30 minutes longer. (I wouldn't have complained if this movie was an hour longer.) Charlize and Hardy made some choices in their actions that were stupidly abrupt. Once I realized they were making life altering decisions in a matter of 30 seconds, I was just thinking in my mind, ""Wait wut..."" Perhaps this was just to speed up the pacing of the movie, but I felt it was clumsy and awkward. Secondly, I'm not sure if Hardy was the right actor to play Max. I feel like Max is supposed to be more of a ""badass"" guy who still has glimpses of feelings. Hardy just seemed too soft and sensitive in his role. I feel Daniel Craig would have been perfectly suited for Max, but that probably would've exceeded the budget.

"May 17, 2015","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" 10 Scale Rating: 9.0 (Fantastic) ...

The Good: Quite possibly one of the greatest action films of the last 20 years, if not of all time. The film retains the gritty tone of the original films, but with updated effects and choreography that is mind-blowing. ""Pulse-pounding"" and ""edge of your seat action"" are terms that get thrown around a lot in reviews of films like this one, but they are completely appropriate here. Almost the entirety of the movie is spent on one ""war rig"", but there is a certain level of twisted beauty in the simplicity of it all. The vehicles are fascinating beasts of twisted metal and gasoline. The characters are hopeless, yet determined. The world itself is barren, hot, and unforgiving. This all sets the tone perfectly as you watch the protagonists struggle through it all in a series of brilliantly designed chases, brutal battles, and bloody deaths. Hardy was well cast as the titular Mad Max, grunting and fighting while uttering few words. Nicholas Hoult is unrecognizable as Nux, one of Immortan Joe's (the main villain of the film) ""War Boys"". When he's on-screen, he definitely stands out and Hoult is becoming quite the character actor. The real star of the film, however, was Charlize Theron. If anyone ever wondered if she could pull off an action film, wonder no longer. She not only pulls it off, but excels. Entertaining from start to finish, Mad Max: Fury Road is already in the running for best film of 2015. 

The Bad: Not that it matters TOO much, but the plot is not only paper thin, but mostly non-existent. It's a small detail, but prevents the film from being absolutely perfect.

"May 17, 2015","The story being explained by narrative is slmething that is really unique with the movies that have been released recently. It adds a dark tone to the already haunting flashbacks that he suffers and keeps on reminding Max of his troubles past. The score compliments the movie so well in each scene that it just feels natural and as ""in your face"" as it can and should bbe. It doesn't shy away from the orchestra score and the metal riffs transitioning from the mellow scenes and the high octane battles and chases. The fights scenes are beautifully choreographed and just aspire a sense of awe and appreciation to an already detailed work. 

In Conclusion. Mad Max is really enjoyable and when the first action scene picks up it brings the action to your face with its beautiful choreography and score and does not let up until after the movies climax. A total Man flick with a strong female protagonist that is deeply enjoyable.",NEUTRAL

"May 17, 2015","2015 is turning out to be a great year for the R-rated action flick. Normally, this genre is an endangered species in a market full of semi-kid-friendly superhero movies, and other action movies which get toned down to a PG-13 rating. However, this year we have gotten two success stories. First, the excellent Kingsmen: The Secret Service became a surprise hit. Then, Mad Max: Fury Road, one of the most anticipated films of the summer, decided to stay true to its gritty, R-rated roots, and delivered a good movie in the process.

The movie sees Max, now played by Tom Hardy, as he escapes imprisonment from a tyrannical leader. He then joins a party led by rogue worker, played by Charlise Theron, on a journey to Theron's homeland, while being chased by an army of evil soldiers.

Now, prior to watching this, I have unfortunately only seen the first Mad Max movie, so I probably can't speak for a lot of the die-hard fans. However, I really enjoyed this movie, and from what I've heard, a lot of the fans did as well.

This film is action-packed, with a lot of car chases, and I mean a lot of car chases. These chases are very intense, and they are made even more intense by the fact that some of the good guys actually die in them. This tends to be more tense for me than many movies where I am sure that all of them will survive. It also does a good job of displaying the cynical nature of this world, that was displayed in the first one.

These characters are well-acted. Tom Hardy plays Mel Gibson's character of Max pretty well. He convincingly plays a man who is still haunted by the death of his family, which I thought made him a more sympathetic character. Charlise Theron also does a great job of playing a convincing bad-ass soldier.

In conclusion, Mad Max: Fury Road is an intense, well-acted film with plenty of car chases, explosions, and crashes portrayed mostly with practical effects. What a lovely day indeed.

"May 16, 2015","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the most metal movie you will see this summer. This is both its greatest strength but also its greatest drawback. At least half of the individual frames of this movie could be used as a cover of a metal album. The bad guys, the War Boys, tattoo rock concert lineups on the backs of their victims and run with a lunatic wailing away with a flame-spewing guitar in front of a wall of speakers all mounted on a truck screaming across the wasteland.
But this isn't just loud, cheap, bar band metal. This is thoughtful. This is Iron Maiden, smart metal running right up to the edge of prog. There is method to this madness. There are character arcs. There is emotion. There is a central question of whether there is any humanity left in these people. But there is still plenty of Judas Priest as well to punch you right in the face with a spike-studded leather glove.
""Fury Road"" isn't a modernized version of a 1980's movie like we've seen so much of lately. No, ""Fury Road"" by original mastermind George Miller, is the exact reverse. It's a 1980's movie made with modern technology. It fits seamlessly into the ""Mad Max"" mythos and the style and tone match the original trilogy perfectly, just turned up to 11.

I'm rating it a one of the best this year so far.",NEUTRAL
"May 16, 2015","Amazing. Leave it up to a veteran director to show modern Hollywood how action movies are supposed to be made. George Miller the director of the original Mad Max films, returns for another installment. The star that pulls this off is not Tom Hardy, or Charlize Theron, it is George Miller. This film is up to par with the Road Warrior. When watching an installment in the Mad Max series you got to have a ""Fuck you, that's why"" attitude. For example, why is there a truck that only has a guy playing an electric flamethrower guitar with taiko drums in the back because ""Fuck you, that's why. Why in the apocalyptic future do we have big diesel trucks with four seater hot rods plastered onto them, because ""Fuck you that's why. This film is so creative.
Fury Road is the perfect example of escapist action, it's a world that we the viewer completely lose ourselves in. Nothing in this film is hacky. It's a full on creative a Sci-fi action film. A note to those millennials who have never seen the previous films or think that this is a live-action Borderlands: Go fuck yourselves. And how could you not have known anything about this franchise.
This chapter starts with Max being held captive by Immortan Joe, the actor who played Toecutter in the 1979 film. Theron plays Furiosa who takes Joe's wives and leads them into safety on her journey to the ""Green place"" the promised land of her childhood. The whole film is about this chase of Immortan Joe and his goons v Furious, Max and Joes wife's. Much like the other films the film is about one long battle on the road.
Much like Scorsese, Miller never lost the youthful energy that went into his early films. Sure he has directed a sequel to Babe and the Happy Feet films but, you can tell that the Mad Max films is his most beloved piece of work. Unlike Lucas who rushed the prequels of Star Wars and relied heavily on CGI. Miller took great time to develop a concept and utilize practical effects. Which is why this film works. This can be considered to be a throwback to the 80's style of action. However this is what we needed in this day and age.
Hardy does a good job as Mad Max even though I was constantly wondering how badass it would be if it was an aged Mel Gibson. Theron is ruthless as Furiosa. Overall everyone did a great job in making this film come alive and making the world of Mad Max so believable.
Check this film out for the experience. The action is top-notch. This is not a reboot nor remake. It is another chapter in the series. George Miller really shows these young directors how to make a movie.",NEUTRAL

This whole dirty destroyed wasteland of a future where people are either crazy or warriors never did it for me.  Not a style I ever look forward to.  There is so much glorious madness in Fury Road however that I couldn't help but love it.  It's hard to imagine one movie being able to do so many crazy things well.  Tom Hardy is one of those guys you need to watch everything he does.  We already know how good Charlize Theron was and she killed it in this role.  Even Rosie Huntington-Whiteley learned how to act since that Transformers movie she did, and that might be the biggest shocker here.  A lot of surprises for me since I was only going off the one early trailer.  Some of the best explosive action you'll ever see in a movie.

"May 16, 2015","Welcome to the 2015 summer blockbuster season where science fiction and superhero films dominate the urban sea. Big screens light up with flashy CGI and flashier heroes, anti-heroes, and villains; all supported by a maddening crowd of quirky side-kick characters and excitable extras. Enter the post-apocalyptic realm of Mad Max: a quintessential 1980s franchise updated to 2015 standards. The idea of Mad Max as a rogue anti-hero wandering the desert wastes germinates in the mind of director George Miller. Miller and the rest of the developed world saw the energy crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s as a potential point for global meltdown (war, nukes, etc.); and from this crisis Mad Max emerges. In Mad Max: Fury Road, Miller guides a renaissance using skilled cinematography (i.e. camera positions, etc.) to tell his furious road warrior movie. In an recent interview, Miller explained he desired to make Mad Max: Fury Road as a film that would not need subtitles because visuals tell the story, which it does very well. The characters are purposely under-developed and that understandably proves frustrating to viewers and hurts the film. Miller probably relied to heavily of past generations memories of the 1980s storyline, which is a mistake if a true ""renaissance"" of Mad Max is to occur. The actors are very well chosen and realize Miller's production splendidly; Charlize Theron basically owns the show as Furiosa, a female road warrior on a mission of mercy and redemption (a sequel focusing on Furiosa is reportedly in the works). There is an interesting feminist vibe throughout the film as viewers will note; Max, played stoically well by Tom Hardy and a un-recognizable Nicholas Hoult seem to just be tagging along for the ride. The Hoult character Nux contains an interesting storyline of a fanatic who cannot wait to die for cause until he finds a cause to live for. Sacrifice is a key theme throughout Mad Max and blood, engines, sand, gas, grease, and guns are the audience's vehicles in one wild ride.",NEUTRAL

"May 16, 2015","30 years in the making, a pre-production riddled with continual starts and stops, cast changes and release dates and a film prior to it that left most die hard fans on this genre defining series deflated, angered and wondering why the hell Tina Turner was in a George Miller film, never mind the saxophonist. Doesn't sound like what we are going to receive is a winner, even I was extremely skeptical and that was with the mind blowing teaser trailers. Luckily I can report, that after sitting in the very centre of an IMAX screen, ""Earth shattering"" surround sound and 3D glasses to boot, by the end of the 2 hour run time, my heart was officially close to cardiac arrest. Not keen on the idea of 3D, dont worry, Miller actually used a 3D rig to film this, so here we dont have horrid post production 3D, we have true depth and feel, but a little more on that later. Fury Road follows our much loved protagonist Max, sometime after the events of Beyond The Thunderdome, his mind is shattered, he is a introverted, quiet and selfish man, constantly on the run, constantly fighting every element possible in a baron world littered with thugs, killers, rapists and demonesque leaders. This is a world where packs rule the roost, causing a class system that forces the masses upon starvation and poverty, while the powerful use and abuse for their own means, even if its just to boost their ego. After being caught Max by a huge gang of road warriors, he finds himself imprisoned in a city, run by the most disgraceful of leaders, Max is used to feed blood into the character of Nux, a young fanatical that wishes to impress his leader so much, that he will be shown the way to Valhalla. Meanwhile Furiosa, a queen bee, warrior figure is tasked with taking a large cargo and filling it up with precious Gasoline. Only she has another agenda, one to thwart the evil leader and one that sets in motion a 2 hour long chase through the baron apocalyptic landscape in hope of finding her home town. That is essentially what this film is one very long and very impressive car chase, shifting in gear at every turn. Think Mad Max 2's climactic car sequence but injected with a cocktail of every drug known to man. It sounds stale but what we have here is not only one of the best entries in the cannon but one of the best action movies in, forever. It's laced with so much iconography and meaty plot that you cannot help be suckered in. The idea that because Max is psychotic, his blood can ultimately boost a dying youths thirst to fight, the demi god that runs his city and the broken political system, the strong feminist moments littered throughout, really bringing women to the forefront and burying the hatchet in order to escape and become something more, something they deserve to be. Of course the typical Frank Miller moments make it in there but the mans clearly lost his mind, cartels of vehicles contain a roster of characters from a elasticated guitarist that shoots fire from his guitar head, while riffing out a beat for the tribe to drive to, the drummers who lay down the death march, the rival factions, coming together as one to chase down Max and Furiosa, the practical and downright outstanding effects work, its classic Miller but fresh, new, against the grain, gone is a lot of his hoaky humour, while it still has moments of tongue in cheek this is a far polished effort. The cast are astounding, Theron stealing the show as Furiosa, he empowerment and strength is brilliant to see, especially when you would expect to watch Max be the one pulling all the punches. In fact Hardy takes a back seat almost, he down plays Max in such a subtle way allowing the agenda of Theron's character to really grip you. Not that Hardy is bad, quite the opposite, he kicks ass and pays homage to Mel, while adding a touch of his own. Nicholas Hoult is extremely impressive as Nux, a role so bipolar and frenetic, its hard not to love his screen time. In fact everyone is on point here, id be here all day if I were to explain in depth all the characters, but the supporting roster of freaks, geeks and mutants are extremely bizarre and wonderful. What really makes this movie shine however is the chase itself. This is as close to practical, bombastic genius as you are going to get, anytime soon. Cargo's of monster truckers, laden with characters springing back and forth from cars, using unique weapons to blow shit up, pole vaulting between vehicles and just making a mess is dealt with in such a stylistic and real life way that every blow, every explosion, every rip and tear is felt. It's real, your in there and with the 3D I myself was ducking grenades in my seat. My heart was pounding, I was having a panic attack while in complete awe at what I was seeing. The score also rams everything home, its huge, its emotional and its bombastic. You never have time to breathe and if you are, the looming threat is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. All the effort goes to show, as even people who are unfamiliar with the originals are hording out to get copies, Miller has outdone himself here, and this really is a film that should be celebrated for scope and visual finesse. The film is however not without some flaws, as I mentioned earlier, Max takes a back seat and although I know Max's history, i still couldnt help but feel I was missing something a bit more from the writing of his character, his arc isnt really there, he's just Max, yeah he struggles with mental health but it never goes anywhere. The film also has so many faces in it by the final chapter that when it kicks off for the final time, a lot of characters are being massacred and you just dont know much about them, if anything at all. There is also a back tracking element to the whole thing that feels, a bit forced or unsure. At the 3 quarter mark the film doubles back on itself, with no real sense of time or true motivation, it just kind of happens. These things do taint the movie somewhat but in all honesty, I was too busy trying to make sure I didnt need medical attention after the film, it threw and blew me all over the room, it battered me over the head, it made me laugh, made me jump, made me gasp in awe. Its not oscar winner but for what it is, I dare you to find something more solid and expertly crafted. My understanding is that Hardy has signed on for more and if this is the case, hopefully Miller allows him space to breathe and adapt but if its a roller coaster your looking for, this is the Daddy.",NEUTRAL

Mad Max: Fury Road is a spectacular, breathtaking ride and one of if not the best action movie in the past decade or more. Yes, it is better than most if not all of the CG heavy Marvel movies, more fun than the batman movies, with the possible exception of the Dark Knight and maybe even better than Serenity.

Mad Max is flawless. It has not one but two powerful protagonists, a metric shitton of car stunts and explosions, fantastic cinematography and a guy suspended by rubber straps playing a flame-throwing bass/guitar combo. It is flawlessly paced, exquisitely cast,the soundtrack is one of the best semi-diegetic ones in history, the practical effect work on the cars and weapons is the kind of thing that would give younger kids wet dreams and, best of all the movie is in glorious R. And Tom Hardy is possibly a better Mad Max than Gibson despite having to share the spotlight with an interesting character who actually has an arc.

Usually I would deconstruct the plot, obsess over trivia (did you know that the guy who plays Immortan Joe is the same guy who played Toecutter in the fist Mad Max?), praise the acting or delve into the nitty-gritty of production side aspects. But there is no point. Mad Max: Fury Road is a masterpiece, one of the game-changing, industry-shaking action movies and i'll let it speak for itself.",NEUTRAL

Great cars, loud music and half dressed girls...Don't get me wrong the cinematography was fantastic, pointless but fantastic. I can't comment on the plot, you need to have a story, or even a weak premise, to have a plot, there was none... other than let's drive across the desert and then back again.

"May 16, 2015","Mad Max was a very solid movie.  There was hardly any weak spots, rarely was there a break in the action and the main characters had a strong presence on screen.  The film was very bizarre and filled with more then a handful of weird, creepy characters and scenes.  If you want a great story, this one is not for you.  It is very basic and to the point and the entire thing takes place in vehicles driving across a vast deserted, desert world.  The action is frequent and intense and filled with crazy car battles with fire, blood, gore and even a guitarist strapped to the front of a truck playing rock music while flames shoot out from his instrument.   The title character Max had very few lines and grunted the ones he did have, but it left his character with a very mysterious background that I hope they focus on in sequels. Charlize Theron stole the show however and was amazing in every aspect.  I throughly enjoyed the film but it was tough because you are thrown into this crazy world with no explanation of what is going on and why.  Mad Max will please action enthusiasts but if you don't like your movies a little weird and strange, look elsewhere.",NEUTRAL

"May 16, 2015","I did not expect to like this one. Of course, the reviews were 100% true and this is a true masterpiece of modern blockbuster cinema: vivid, gorgeous, hallucinatory, exhilarating and (surprisingly) fervently feminist, this iteration of Mad Max is simply exhaustingly brilliantly achingly sublimely epic. This is a 2 minute trailer pumped up to 120 minutes and the results are just breathtaking. Contrary to my foolish preconceptions, the endless and sprawling battle scenes don't ever grate but instead continuously enthral and captivate for the entirety of the running time. Whilst it's indeed populated by some excellent performances from Hardy, Theron and Hoult and also fizzing with ideas, the sheer thrill of Fury Road is the utterly unimaginable and endlessly creative visual spectacle on screen, a rich and beautiful tapestry of colour and carnage unfolding before us. No I'm not exaggerating and yes I typically detest a carnival of explosions usually but this was something else: inexplicably invigorating, intelligent and frankly impressive, this is the exemplar for all blockbusters to worship from this point forward.",NEUTRAL
"May 16, 2015","You'll leave breathless & speechless. Mad Max is the Raging Bull of modern-day action blockbusters, and one of the best ACTION films to date. Buckle up, it takes you on a viscerally relentless journey through a post-apocalyptic sand world lacking H2O. I love this movie, it really is a classic action feature. Similar to what revolutionary classic films did, like what Breathless did for romance & Blade Runner did for sci-fi, Mad Max shows us what action truly is & what so many of todays blockbusters are missing. That sense of soul & humanity within the world. Its so simple, and like being dropped into an everyday circumstance of this world & the tension within. Just another day, but a lovely day. I love that simplicity of its premise and nature, and the in-your-face saying this is action. Driven on cocaine, its comic-bookie graphic novel-type storytelling grasps your attention like no other film, right from the get go & your off.
This is what action pictures are meant to do, and this tops it off.

"May 16, 2015","This movie will not get the ""film literature"" or ""industry"" respect that it deserves, but that doesn't stop it from being one of the most successfully ambitious films this year. The sheer attention to detail and devotion to genre makes it so much more than your average action film and pushes it more into full-on abstract art territory. Quite simply put: movies this meticulous, created with this much care and thought with (in particular) very minimal reliance on CGI just aren't made very often anymore. And that is why this one will be way more memorable for ""film people"" than it probably will be for most of the population. This is not a bad thing, of course.",NEUTRAL

"May 16, 2015","George MIller's epic reboot of the franchise that he himself originated is finally here, and you bet your ass it was well worth the wait. The film is structured so that it plays out like one extended chase sequence, stopping only to change a tire. Fury Road is rich in visual style, with landscapes of windswept golden decay. Sounds of gunfire and roaring engines set the mood. The characters are delightfully demented, complete with protruding abscess's and tumors. Head bad guy, Immortan Joe (played by Road Warrior alumni Hugh Keays-Byrne) is a religious Zealot who's primary hold on the people involves control over the water which he pumps out from deep within the earth. Joe's followers are painted crazies who are eager to go to their deaths (so that they may reach the gates of Valhalla) for him. Tom Hardy is Max Rockatansky, rugged survivor, and man of few words. Hardy is perfect here, he possesses the animal ferocity and the thousand yard stare to boot. I wanna say that the real star of the show is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, Theron is no stranger to shedding her Hollywood image in favor of something far grimier. Here she sports a shaved head and a deadly prosthetic arm. Rounding out the core cast is Nick Hoult as Nux, a down on his luck ""warboy"" who sees a chance to become something more. The theme is redemption, not just for Furiosa, but for all of the characters. Max is seeking to right the wrongs of his past by being a force for good. The pace is marred ever so slightly by a lagging third act just before the virtuoso final action set piece, but it is necessary to at least attain some back story. The wardrobe department on this film must have been immense, no expense is spared, everyone looks beaten down and gnarly. This is great stuff folks! Everything form the zany production design to the ridiculous (but mostly practical) stunts is top notch, I for one couldn't be happier that Miller finally decided to take Mad Max out of retirement.",NEUTRAL

Probably not, but I also don't believe in perfection. I can pick at things here and there like a lot of movies, and while I'll let time tell what the legacy of this film will be, I'll safely say this is a bright spot that proves that great films can still come out of the big movie machine in this day and age, and need not any original ideas either. Fury Road is a very simple post-apocalypse adventure that is light on story, but excels because of great aesthetic filmmaking and retaining a character to it that sets the film apart from the overload of bland, similar big budget products that dominate a lot of theatres. Fury Road will certainly grab everyone's attention and wake us up to what movies can strive to be... it already has.",NEUTRAL

"May 16, 2015","I rarely use the word masterpiece when talking about movies, but there is no hesitation here: Mad Max: Fury Road is a masterpiece. The atmosphere, the score, the visuals and masterfully pulled off practical effects were the perfect overlay for surprisingly thoughtful world-building that implied more visually than any dialogue exposition could have.

It never once tried to be anything other than what it originally sought to be--a reckless, top speed car chase with interesting and imagination-capturing characters. There wasn't a lot of dialogue, but their actions conveyed more about them than most movies manage to say with a script that calls for ten times the dialogue. There were no heavy handed political messages that sad internet weirdos calling for a boycott feared there would be and it had the same spirit that the originals did with a bigger budget and bigger stakes. 

For those complaining that Hardy wasn't the main character or didn't have enough lines, I implore you to watch the originals for a refresher. Max is and always has been a narrative ghost who drifts through insane circumstances and watches the struggles of others unfold around him. Sometimes he fights it, sometimes he tries to ignore it, but generally his memories point him toward doing the right thing. Like the viewer, Max is just a passenger on someone else's insane, Heavy Metal ride--figuratively and in the case of Fury Road, literally.

This fast paced series of explosions has immediately solidified itself as possibly the best movie I have ever seen, and definitely the best movie I have ever seen in theaters. I have zero regrets about seeing this in 3D, and recommend that you do, too. Do not miss this in theaters!",NEUTRAL

"May 16, 2015","MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is not only a spectacle to watch, it's a reminder of just how good movies can still be. Push all the action aside for one moment. The story is a typical tale of what when the strong have the resources and the muscle to suppress the weak. But in this is a sense of perspective. MM shows us a little as to why people have chosen to follow a false God, and why the enemy has become the enemy. The whole post-apocalyptic world is a fascinating study into what humanity would be forced to do should our planet dry up...and it ain't pretty. What IS pretty is the scenery. I have never wanted to pause a movie just to explore what I was watching more in my life. Each car looks like a joint collaboration between Ed Roth, HR Giger, and a nine year old boy who loves bashing up his Hot Wheels. This is matched by the amazing steampunk inspired wardrobe. And then there's the action. The first 20 minutes will feel like someone opened your skull, poured some radiator fluid in your brain, and wired your nerves to a never ending loop of Ministry's Jesus Built My Hotrod. The editing & lowered frame rate will set you on rails, akin to riding the best/scariest roller coaster of your life. You want it to stop, but you don't. The best part of this was knowing that most of the stunts were 100% real. Director Frank Miller kept the CG and green screening to a bare bones. And just when you don't think you can take another hour and forty minutes of this, Miller gives your brain (and ears) a rest to introduce the women of the story. They are the real heroes here. While beautiful, Charlize Theron and the ""wives"" aren't just there to pretty up the desert. They each bring a story of women who are desperate to escape evil. Each are powerful and balanced. Then there's Max. Played by Tom Hardy, Max is haunted by a past where his actions, or lack thereof follow him relentlessly. He's pretty stoic and silent, but this isn't to say he's wooden. Hardy gives Max enough emotion for us to understand how messed up the guy is. He has the desire to do good, but years of running have rusted his ability to care. Even if bloodthirsty action and muscle cars aren't your thing, Mad Max: Fury Road is a chrome and skull encrusted blueprint of how filmmakers can make us fall in love with movies again.",NEUTRAL

"May 16, 2015","Visually stunning, Mad Max: Fury Road is one helluva movie that gives us a frenetic and frightening post-apocalyptic landscape while nodding to the resulting gender politics in said landscape. The movie balances itself between subtle, almost absurd humor and the severity of the situation. Similarly, the movie shows disturbing images and storylines of misogyny (women being reduced to procreative functions, from forced ""breeders"" to forced suppliers of ""mother's milk"") while itself not being a misogynistic movie. As a result, this powerful tension highlights the utter ugliness of misogyny and hatred/distrust of women. 

The cinematography is downright stunning, with the barren desert landscapes, ginormous mudflats, and evocative night skies dotted with stars, and the speeded-up film in select scenes creates a wonderful frenetic tension in the viewers.

In a brilliant move, Miller turns the macho action film paradigm on it's head; yes, Tom Hardy is very, very good as the eponymous Max, but this is Charlize Theron's show. As Imperator Furiosa she drives (tee hee) the action of this film. She's a woman who can proudly take her place next to Elanor Ripley and Buffy Summers and the rest of them. And by the time we meet a motorcycle gang of grandmothers turned snipers, it's clear that the women are the strong ones in this apocalyptic world that Miller has brilliantly realized. And as for the action--which is about 100 minutes of the film's 120 minute runtime--you've never seen anything like it. This is no infantile CGI-fest. Miller goes old-school and has real men clinging to real cars zipping around the Nambian desert. It makes all seven ""Fast and Furious"" movies combined look like ""Driving Miss Daisy"". Best of all, the geography of the action is 100% clear at all times. You never wonder who is fighting whom in relation to what. I can't wait to see it again.",NEUTRAL

The ""hot wives"" and old ladies in the movie were annoying and confusing, as was trying to keep up with who is dead, dying, or totally fine after each car crash and knife wound.  Trying to sneak past a war party would be easy if done at night, but for some reason the group tries to do it during bright daytime.  The film's action is directly masterfully, and the fast motion camera and experimental editing might work in a $1.5 million independent film, but is a distraction in a $150 million blockbuster.  The movie tries to be overly-weird (cutting out babies from pregnant models) but the only weird thing about it is that Dennis Hopper never shows up to claim this Dry Land for himself.

He perfectly plays the loner, with good intentions. Charlize Theron is as much a major role in this movie as Tom Hard is and adds as much in the role as he does. Intact at some points I thought Theron was the star of the movie. The story itself is not weighed down by overly complicated or deep story telling. Its too the point and then we get down to the action, its pulsating, its exciting, its non-fucking stop!

"May 16, 2015","It's well over 35 years since Aussie director George Miller launched Mel Gibson's career with Mad Max, a micro-budget, near-future-set revenge pic which remains one of the most profitable films in history. Now, with the kind of backing one only gets off the back of a successful franchise about dancing penguins, Miller cuts loose with A-list stars in Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, along with all the vehicles he could ever wish to detonate.

And what a glorious, ludicrous, demented living videogame he's come up with.

It's a world where, in spite of the title, Hardtack uber-stoic Max is about the sanest thing going. Where, in spite of an apparent lack of ammunition, it's quite acceptable for former wrestler Nathan Jones, chin covered in latex like some sort of jacked up refugee from Bo Selecta, to randomly fire a minigun into the air for no discernible reason. And where, in spite of the rarity of fossil-based energy, warlords under no circumstances would dream of heading into battle unless their lead vehicle is fronted with a rack of speakers that would make Metallica blush, and a skull-faced loon in a red onesie, hammering out power chords on a double-necked guitar that belches flames.

While subtlety is absolutely not the order of the day, action is. And for all the Avengers' city-levelling, CGI-heavy destruction, Fury Road's vehicular mayhem is infinitely more satisfying, bone crunching and exhilarating than most summers full of blockbusters can manage between them. 

Although the plot puts the guff into Macguffin, it doesn't matter. It's just one fist-pumping set piece after another as Max and Co lay waste to a colourful rogues gallery of baddies, with each successive sequence somehow outdoing the last, with incredible displays of practical effects and stuntwork.

With Hardy reportedly on board for a trilogy, it's going to be a lot of fun seeing how Miller can top this one.",NEUTRAL

"May 16, 2015","Most of the early reviews for Fury Road are resoundingly positive, even celebratory. And it really is a fun ride, with some sublimely nightmarish visuals and plenty of the type of antic violence that made The Road Warrior simultaneously silly and disturbing. But you'll enjoy Fury Road more if you manage your expectations. Solidly entertaining action flick though it may be, it's no Mad Max, no Road Warrior. Many of the overly enthusiastic reviews are by bien pensant liberals tickled pink that Imperator Furiosa, Charlize Theron's character, is such a bad ass, and they love that her mission of redemption has her saving a group of young slave women kept as breeders by the chief baddie, Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who also played Toecutter in the original Mad Max). Theron really is good in the movie, and the breeders' escape would make for a decent enough plot on its own. But none of the characters, including Furiosa, is developed enough to make us much care about them as anything but symbols. More fatally for the movie as a whole, this is true of Max as well. 

	Director George Miller seems to have acquired a severe case of attention-deficit disorder over the last 30 years (like all the rest of us). The title might more rightly be Mad Max: Freak Show, as it moves to the center the bizarre and disorienting weirdness that occupied the periphery of the first two movies. At the center of those movies was a Max who was convincing as a sensitive family man, thrill-seeking go-getter cop, and, well, mad man bent on revenge. In the latest movie, Tom Hardy plays a much more brutish Max, closer to what we saw in Road Warrior but without the narrative grounding. (He also sounds a little too much like Bane at a couple points.) We're just supposed to know this is Max, even though he's haunted by a young girl we don't know from the earlier movies. Of course, he's haunted by her death and his failure to save her-what else do you need to know, right? Furiosa tells him-just tells him-that she too is after redemption, presumably for serving Immortan for as long as she has. 

Conspicuously absent from this Mad Max movie is a revenge plot. One of the escaped girls gets scared when the action really heats up and says she wants to return to the citadel run by Joe. One of the irradiated War Boys pursuing them arbitrarily switches his allegiance and ends up sacrificing himself to protect the women. With the exception of Furiosa, who wants to return to the Green Place she was kidnapped from as a child, and Joe, who wants his breeders back, no one has much motivation to speak of. With characters this paper thin, the action can only be spectacular, not compelling. I almost wished Miller had realized his story was actually about the escaping women-he could have saved the Mad Max reboot for another movie, giving all the characters the space they deserved.

Even though the screenplay is a disaster, with dialogue as disposable as the characters and nothing truly memorable to take away, Fury Road really is spectacular. As chaotic as the action sequences are, they're still coherent as sequences, something many action films don't bother with anymore. And though the freakishness doesn't belong as close to the center of focus as it is, it's still enjoyably unsettling and at times hilariously over the top. Ultimately, it's a great action flick to see on the big screen. But I doubt any kids who see it today are going to be anywhere near as nostalgic for it in thirty years as boys from my generation were for the first two movies. Still, as my best friend said after the credits started rolling, ""It was a lot better than Beyond Thunderdome.""",NEUTRAL

Like some unholy union between The Wacky Races cartoon and an Iron Maiden album cover. Miller has described the film as one long chase sequence. When you get right down to it, that's pretty accurate. Plotwise it's a race to there and back again. But it's Colin Gibson's production design, John Seale's cinematography, Junkie XL's immersive score, and Jenny Beavan's costumes that define this movie. The look is absolutely bonkers. It's a testament to the visual and aural overload that it propels an adult like me into giddy exuberance. Mad Max: Fury Road is an all out pedal to the metal, full throttle chase with nothing held back. You know those pre-teens raised on heavy metal music and 80s action movies back in the day? Well we're adults now.  This movie hits the sweet spot.

I'm assuming he wanted to provide a lot of action for a society with a short attention span.  The only problem is that the pacing of the movie creates two problems.  The first, and most important problem is the lack of dialogue.  This does not let any of the characters or storylines develop.  The second casualty is the excitement itself.

Tom Hardy plays Max, a man of little words but many actions. He was captured by Imperator Joe and his War boys, and enslaved to them, forced to give his blood to keep the sick war boys alive and make them stronger.

While Hardy is the leading name, I feel that the two best performances were actually by Charlize Theron as the fierce Imperator Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult as Nux, the endearingly reverent War boy. Despite the performances, Miller's vision is by far what makes the film a rousing success.

"May 15, 2015","""As the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy. Me... Or everyone else.""

To describe George Miller's fourth post-apocalyptic Mad Max film as crazy would be an understatement because it is one of those rare over the top and unique action films that keeps you at the edge of your seat during its entire runtime with fantastic car chases and inventive fighting scenes that feel like a breath of fresh air in an era dominated by CGI effects. The visuals absolutely stun you and Miller's amazing vision of this apocalyptic wasteland is beautifully captured through the camera. It may have taken 30 years for this sequel to be released, but it is a huge improvement over Beyond Thunderdome and it manages to build on what The Road Warrior had achieved by introducing a much more chaotic world and colorful characters. Fury Road works both ways as either a sequel or a reboot, and it erases most of the problems I had with Max's character in the previous film. This is a return to what Miller had done in The Road Warrior, but with a much higher budget to work with and that allowed his vision to be fully fulfilled here. Three more Mad Max films are already in the talks and I can't wait to embark with Max on his next adventures. This is going to be a very difficult film to top and so far it's the best 2015 has to offer.

In Fury Road, Tom Hardy replaces Mel Gibson for the lead role of Max, a wondering warrior who's still coping with the loss of his wife and son as he travels through the post-apocalyptic deserted wasteland. The film begins with a group of bandits chasing Max who eventually capture him and take him to The Citadel, where a ruthless leader named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) controls the water supply for the masses that have gathered below the heights of the mountain where he is based. Joe doesn't just control the water supply, he also has a large army of War Boys who he has trained to sacrifice themselves willingly for his service, farming women who breed their breast milk, and even several beautiful wives to give him children. Joe has created quite an empire, and Max has been enslaved to serve as a blood donor for the injured War Boys. We are introduced to this crazy place and its rules as Joe sends his trusted lieutenant, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) on a local errand with her fuel filled rig to Gasland. However, she  decides to take another route and her intentions are soon revealed. She is helping some of Joe's wives escape from their enslavement promising to lead them to the green lands. When Joe discovers that she has betrayed him he sends all his boys out on a desperate chase and that includes Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of the War Boys who is using Max as his personal blood bag. Nux chains Max to the front of his vehicle and brings him along the desperate and nonstop chase that ensues. For the next two hours Fury Road is basically one extensive chase that will get the entire audiences' blood pumping.  

I've praised Miller's vision and his direction, as well as the spectacular action set pieces he has crafted, but it wouldn't do this film justice if the cast didn't receive its share of praise as well. It isn't easy to fill the shoes of such an iconic character like Mad Max, but Tom Hardy pulled it off in a very convincing matter. As much as I like Mel Gibson, I have to give Hardy a lot of praise for delivering such an entertaining performance. He is one of my favorite actors working today. It was also great to see Hugh Keays-Byrne back in a Mad Max film playing a different character this time, but he absolutely nailed the menacing role of Joe. Nicholas Hoult was also a pleasant surprise, but perhaps the greatest addition to this franchise was Charlize Theron's Furiosa who injects the film with a very much needed feminist tone. Theron delivers perhaps the strongest and most memorable role in the movie and she is one kick-ass action star. It helped that she got a lot of action scenes where she actually got to do something instead of being the damsel in distress. The look of the film is also breathtaking, and the way that Miller envisions this world is simply fantastic. The cool vehicles are built from all sorts of scrappy metals and materials you'd collect in the wasteland. Everything about this film is simply fantastic and the action scenes don't disappoint one bit. You will feel the rush from the very opening scene and it will continue long after the credits begin to roll. Fury Road is the best film of the franchise.

We are introduced to this crazy place and its rules as Joe sends his trusted lieutenant, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) on a local errand with her fuel filled rig to Gasland. However, she  decides to take another route and her intentions are soon revealed. She is helping some of Joe's wives escape from their enslavement promising to lead them to the green lands. When Joe discovers that she has betrayed him he sends all his boys out on a desperate chase and that includes Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of the War Boys who is using Max as his personal blood bag. Nux chains Max to the front of his vehicle and brings him along the desperate and nonstop chase that ensues. For the next two hours Fury Road is basically one extensive chase that will get the entire audiences' blood pumping.  

I've praised Miller's vision and his direction, as well as the spectacular action set pieces he has crafted, but it wouldn't do this film justice if the cast didn't receive its share of praise as well. It isn't easy to fill the shoes of such an iconic character like Mad Max, but Tom Hardy pulled it off in a very convincing matter. As much as I like Mel Gibson, I have to give Hardy a lot of praise for delivering such an entertaining performance. He is one of my favorite actors working today. It was also great to see Hugh Keays-Byrne back in a Mad Max film playing a different character this time, but he absolutely nailed the menacing role of Joe. Nicholas Hoult was also a pleasant surprise, but perhaps the greatest addition to this franchise was Charlize Theron's Furiosa who injects the film with a very much needed feminist tone. Theron delivers perhaps the strongest and most memorable role in the movie and she is one kick-ass action star. It helped that she got a lot of action scenes where she actually got to do something instead of being the damsel in distress. The look of the film is also breathtaking, and the way that Miller envisions this world is simply fantastic. The cool vehicles are built from all sorts of scrappy metals and materials you'd collect in the wasteland. Everything about this film is simply fantastic and the action scenes don't disappoint one bit. You will feel the rush from the very opening scene and it will continue long after the credits begin to roll. Fury Road is the best film of the franchise.

I'm a big apocalyptic movie fan, and am usually very picky about them, and if a movie is good I will simply be satisfied with it and leave it at that, however this movie is way beyond that. I am simply AMAZED at the masterpiece that is Mad Max: Fury Road.

When I first saw the trailer I gotta say I was quite excited, it looked like a relatively enjoyable post apocalyptic movie. And it had Tom Hardy in it, which was great, no complaints there. In no way was I prepared for it, though. Every scene was action packed, exploding chaos, and to sum it up it was pure brilliance. And the strong female characters portrayed in it are wonderful and it's very refreshing to see that in an action movie.

I recommend it to everyone, even if action movies/ post apocalyptic movies/ thriller movies aren't your thing, I still recommend it. I'm going to have to go see it at the very least, 5 more times.

If I could give it a higher rating then I would, but unfortunately I can't so 5 stars.",NEUTRAL
"May 15, 2015","A true masterpiece in all technical aspects. I mean, George Miller truly is on the action movie Olympus after this one. The world he built back in the 80's has never felt so vivid an real. The art direction, the character designs, everything has a personality that only a true visionary can accomplish. Miller practically does the opposite of George Lucas, having the technology and the resources, he expands his world, making the dangers of the wasteland and the desolation feel palpable, never making it too convoluted. The action sequences are just breathtaking, and knowing that almost all of it is practical just gives it a whole new dimension. The characters are developed in a way that is compelling, but doesn't give too much away. Miller doesn't tell you about them or their world, he shows you. The only real problem might be that there's a little bit that drags before the final act, but  keeping that frenetic pace for the whole two hours probably was impossible. 
Nods to the fans, welcoming to new audiences, and having something for anyone who likes action cinema. Fury Road really sets a really high standard for action blockbusters.

"May 15, 2015","What a lovely movie! I had never seen a Mad Max movie before this one, and honestly, I don't think it's necessary. Each Mad Max movie pretty much stands on its own, including this one. Even more with this one since Mel Gibson didn't return, and this movie has a very different style to it than the others as well. This movie is very simple in the story department, but the main draw of the film is the extreme, practically non stop action, and just crazy world. George Miller did a great job focusing on practical effects over CG, and it shows in some ridiculously awesome action. The soundtrack is also amazing, perfectly putting the action into a musical form, even serving as the sound effect track for a good portion of the movie. The movie is just really exciting, adrenaline pumping craziness. It's definitely a weird universe though, which I could see turning some people away, and it can also take a while to figure out just exactly what's going on with the world as well, and what story is there is pretty thin, but the main focus of the movie is on the action, world building, visuals, and the soundtrack, and in those areas, I can think of very few films that do as well as Fury Road did.

"May 15, 2015","Okay, first review on here, but hear me out. Some people are bashing this movie for no plot or character development, and while it's no Shawshank Redemption or Godfather, it is still an amazing movie. And yes, those people are wrong, and chose not to pay attention because they probably don't like action films to begin with. Max undergoes huge development in the movie. Not to give anything away, but in short, he goes from a single instinct, survive, to someone willing to risk it all to protect others. Flashbacks that reference the originals influence his decision to help instead of fending for himself.  Uh hello, that is textbook character development. As far as plot, this movie isn't an origin story, so don't expect a nice, neat opening. Go watch the originals for that. But yes, this movie's plot is present, it's a story of survival, desperation, and yes, even heart. To be able to get 98% on rotten tomatoes should say it all. Best rated action movie of all time, and is even top ten of all time here on rotten tomatoes. This is a milestone action movie next to The Matrix, Diehard, Terminator 2, Aliens, The Road Warrior, Indian Jones, Star Wars, etc. Some people just rate movies and put them into one category. You have to place them in their respective categories; George Miller wan't aiming for a slow burn drama, he was aiming for an adrenaline filled thrill ride. And by God, he did it. Don't listen to the bad reviews, or even the good reviews for that matter. Go watch the movie for yourself, and you will see how this movie ranks among the greatest action flicks.",NEUTRAL

"May 15, 2015","George Millerâ??s Mad Max: Fury Road released within me a whole variety of polarized emotions and feelings in its two-hour running time. In the first hour of the film I was extremely confused, questioning the very existence of the film, but still beholding and allowing myself to be stunned by its immense cinematic beauty, which is encompassed by the over-stylized, gorgeous and unprecedented cinematography, meticulous fast-paced editing, dazzling visual effects, and its complex and symbolic production design. However, I was struggling to actually understand what was going on. To be completely honest, I was hating the movie at the beginning. Feelings of intense stress and confusion arose, and a huge migraine knocked on my skullâ??s surface. I seriously have never been so grateful for the existence of silence. Those beautiful silent aerial shots when we were overlooking an explosion saved my brain from exploding. I was thinking: â??What the actual fuck is this?â??. I am going to start dramatizing now, Mad Max is probably the loudest film I have ever experienced, and this can be a real pain in the ass for people with sensory overload. I missed some parts of the dialogue because it felt like my ears were taken from me. Oh yeah, I was not enjoying it, technical aspects aside of course.

Then, the film started unraveling its quite simple storyline amidst an extremely convoluted world, and things started making some sense. Mad Max is some sort of new generation road movie set in an apocalyptic male chauvinist society that is run by people who control water, gasoline, and women. See anything familiar? It probably resembles most governments in the world? Yeah, I think it does. In this world, women are just used for reproduction (preferably baby boys please), but Furiosa (the exquisite Charlize Theron), Max (PTSD- speechless Tom Hardy), and other women, instigate a small-scale uprising and set out to find a place that feels like home; a place that would embody the very foundations of hope. The use of the heroine in this film, who is unquestionably Furiosa, mixed with the ideology of overthrowing male power and boosting up womenâ??s strength, makes Mad Max a trailblazer in feminist film-making, not only because of the filmâ??s apocalyptic nature, but also because of its genre. How often do we get to see this happen?

However, I do think there were some problems with the film. One of them is that Mad Max is way, way, way too over the top. It is probably extravagance multiplied by some good millions. And it is my opinion that its style is extremely overpowering, to the extent that it reaches a level where you debate whether it is a good thing or not, especially in the first act of the film. Donâ??t get me wrong, I love how it looks. But the over-stylization causes dizziness, which in the end might blind the audience of either noticing important symbols or understand whatâ??s happening. Whether this was on purpose or not, it is irrelevant. Iâ??m certain it was on purpose and I donâ??t necessarily agree with this decision. Moreover, it takes a little bit too much to unravel its plot, but I canâ??t complain about that since the movieâ??s subtitle addresses the fact that it is a ROAD, a road that the audience has to ride, and I guess they cannot skip parts of the ride to explain what was going on.

Nonetheless, everything paid off in the end. In Mad Max we have a film that can transcend the screen by having people talk about it in the way they are now, but also itâ??s a film that does not forget its genre, and that is something I really cherish. One of the things that I liked the most about Mad Max is that it is an action film with a multi-layered symbolic world, and it is not just an action piece that wants to boasts its visual effects and its car crashes. Letâ??s face it, this genre tends to fall into a shallow pit of violence most of the time. But Mad Max rises above all of this, and it still makes some space for some â??coolâ?? stuff, which is probably what most people like about it (not judging, not judging). Iâ??m not watching this again in a long time because I donâ??t want my body to physically go through it again, but I really recommend it. Now you can understand why my opinions are polarized, since I am still processing the film. Although, do take into consideration that I am not a fan of action movies and I am not used to this, but action buffs will surely love it. But please, bring some Advils and do your brain a favor, because itâ??s one hell of a ride. Literally.",NEUTRAL

"May 15, 2015","Mad Max Fury Road showered my brain in guzzoline, lit it on fire, then left it out in the wasteland to wander aimlessly. Then it came back to take a nice, long, steamy piss on me. Then stuffed a bag of cocaine in my mouth and forced me to chew. 


Fury Road stands next to the originals in a different way. While some might not like the story, I found the plot to be great for a movie about a single car chase. 
Tom Hardys plays a much more ""Mad"" Max. With hallucinations and the occasional voices coming from nowhere. I enjoyed Tom Hardys max just as much as Mel's, and I'm glad that he didn't try to mimic Mel's Max, as he created his own max that fit him perfectly. Charlize Therons ""Imperator Furiosa"" matches up with max in almost every single way; fighting, marksmanship, and like max, she is a hollow shell of herself. Determined to get Immortan Joes wives or ""breeders"" across the desert to her childhood home, Furiosa is tested in many ways, although staying strong throughout the dangerous journey, making her one of the strongest female characters in recent years. 

Consensus: Fury Road has some of the strongest action sequences in recent years. While character development was not as good as expected, if you do your research, the backstories are great. Story was great for the circumstances. Fury Road is permanently engraved in my mind, and has raised the bar cinematically in alot of ways.",NEUTRAL

The stunts are fantastic, the visuals are breathtaking, and it slows down just enough for you to catch your breath and move the story along. Tom Hardy graciously takes over the role once played by Mel Gibson and rightfully earns the part at the same time.

Ladies and gentlemen, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is one for the ages. The film is basically one giant chase sequence...but it, and I highly doubt I'm overstating this, is very likely to be the greatest chase sequence ever put on film. How they managed to not have any stuntman, extra, or actor killed in the making this movie is a miracle in and of itself, but what George Miller and his team have crafted is nothing short of an exhilarating, utterly insane (they don't call it ""Mad Max"" for no reason), emotionally gripping, bloody, artistic masterpiece. Despite the vast wastelands, every frame of the film is littered with stunning detail, every shot perfectly framed, every performance on point, and every action sequence an unforgettable, sweaty-palmed experience you won't forget. And that musical score!! The hairs in my arms would stand each time it would kick up -- amazing. The editing is flawless. The pacing immaculate. For the longest time I've wanted to see an adaptation of the videogame ""Twisted Metal"", but feared it would be near impossible to be done right. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is that dream come to fruition. It's everything I love in action films and more--so much more. Run to your theater and support this film.

"May 15, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is a rambunctious feast burned to chrome-like heat by stunning, steam-punk inspired visuals, and mesmerizing performances from Theron and Hardy, paired with a thoughtful commentary on ecological catastrophe and feminism. 

Miller has crafted what is easily the best film of 2015, and by most accounts, a milestone in the action movie genre. This is brilliant catastrophe at scale, both well-realized and expertly choreographed. Few films can match the relentless insanity that is Mad Max, and for a director in his 70's, Miller has vastly outdone his younger peers - whose shakycam-CG antics are laid bare as nothing more than cheap trinkets.

"May 15, 2015","Well, it's been a while. But sometimes, maybe that's not a bad thing. 30 years since Mad Max: Beyond the Thunderdome. And unlike it's predecessor Mad Max:Fury Road does not disappoint. 

Fans of the first two movies will enjoy this as anyone else seeking a tense, action road thriller. 

Nothing's changed really. The Mad Max world created by George Miller is still ugly, lawless and messed up. The opening shot re-introduces us to Max, now played by Tom Hardy, and proves a very appropriate piece of casting. Before the opening in credit are done, Max reminds us of who he is and the world he lives in, is kidnapped, escapes, re-captured, brandished, tattooed and used as a ""blood bag"" for a ""War Boy"" played by Nicholas Hoult, who, shaved-headed and covered in white body paint, took me a moment to realize it was him. 

He is a ""war boy"" for Immortan Joe, a horrible and wonderfully depicted ruler and villain.  He has hundreds of bald war boys at his disposal, and has control of the water supply, in whatever part of the post-apocalyptic world we find ourselves in. Furosia, played by the also hardly recognizable Charlize Theron, is assigned to drive a 'war rig"" to collect gasoline for Joe. She has an envoy with her of Joe's men, armed in case of attack.

But Furosia betrays Joe, looking to return to where she had been kidnapped from by Joe, and also helping some of Joe's young, beautiful brides to escape, not wanting their babies to become property of Joe. And so we begin a nail biting 2 hour car chase across this desolate world where there is only a glimmer of hope.

Director George Miller does a wonderful job with his locations and shots. The desert in Namibia is a wonderful and colorful backdrop which Miller uses to it's fullest. This is an old hand doing what he knows and doing it well. I must also compliment the restraint used in the script. Dialogue is kept to a minimum. The actors respond with subtle reactions telling us what we need instead of using words. This is a director who totally understands the medium he is working on.

Hardy, Theron and Hoult all deliver great performances. Hugh Key-Byrne's Joe is wonderfully grotesque. Rosie Huntington-Wiley is the lead ""bride"" who thankfully has learn some acting skills since we saw her in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. 

The movie is like a wind-up toy car, and once you let go, it's off. It's tense and exciting stuff and not over-complicated. It keeps it simple and does it effectively.

For me it was very nice to see the the female roles, especially Theron, giving and receiving as much action as any of the males characters do. There's also really nice roles for some wonderful older female actors, a rarity. There's a lovely equilibrium to the movie, everyone is on the same playing field.

It's a nice contrast to all the CGI heavy action movies who's scripts and plots seem to be lost in the sound and look of digital explosions and effects. Mad Max: Fury Road, keeps it simple and does it well. Best action movie of the year so far, sorry Avengers.",NEUTRAL

Tom Hardy is a suitable replacement for Max, even if his accent isn't quite on point, but who really steals the show Theron's Furiousa, a strong female warrior with a a robotic arm, an expertise in firearms and driving, and a big heart.  With a terrifying villain, Mad Max is scary, exciting, fun and just plain batsh*t crazy.

George Miller has been away from his seminal post apocalyptic wasteland franchise mad max for 30 years and i think it's safe to say he is back and better than ever even at the grand old age of 70. Miller has created a fast paced pedal to the metal extravaganza that never loosens it's grip on you for the full 120 minute running time with mind boggling practical stunts and incredible moments of cgi not to mention some awesome world building with the diffrent clans and characters we see or meet along this chaotic viceral and visually staggering journey. mad max fury road is an action masterclass  and will surely become a modern classic it's lite and simple yet still intriguing plot is  pushed forward  with great performances from Hugh keays-byrne(toecutter from the original mad max), Tom hardy, Nicholas Holt and the real stand out Charlize Theron. Fury road shows how a modern blockbuster should be done and is my favourite film of 2015 so far and also one of the best pure action movies your likely to see in a very long time.

Tom Hardy is a welcome replacement for Mel Gibson in the lead role, but it is Charlize Theron who steals the show here and completely owns her role as a bad-ass, take-no-shit, fighter and will likely go down as one of the best female heroines we've had. The story is just enough to propel the action and the film is literally a 2-hour chase scene with all kinds of mayhem and madness that is right at home in this insane universe and I'm still baffled wondering how they pulled it all off. This is easily the wackiest entry in the Mad Max series with some straight-up, BIZARRE character moments; but it's all in good fun and I had a stupid grin on my face throughout.

Mad Max: Fury Road is a what a slam-bang action-adventure is supposed to look and feel like. Featuring some of the most amazing action sequences yet filmed, along with these things called stunts, Director/Maestro George Miller brings us back to post-apocalyptic Australia like the last 30 years were just yesterday. Max (now played by Tom Hardy) teams up with Imperator Furiousa, who is attempting to smuggle Immortin Joe's....oh, screw it dude. If your a Mad Max fan, the last thing your here for is plot and characters. What's important is this: Charlize Theron absolutely kills it as Imperator Furiousa, the most badass female action hero since Ellen Ripley first strapped on her flame thrower. The only sore spot here is the casting of Max. The always superb Tom Hardy feels miscast here, never quite equalling the charm and charisma that the exiled Mel Gibson so effortlessly brought to the role. This, however, does little (if anything) to take away from the visceral thrills and stunning visuals that await you. Buckle up (seriously).",NEUTRAL

"May 15, 2015","There are movies that take some time to settle in after a first viewing, before you can really decide how you feel about them - Mad Max: Fury Road happens to be one of those movies. It isn't due to a complex narrative or deeply written characters though; it's because for two hours, you eyes will bear witness to a non-stop barrage of in-your-face, high octane action that really has to be seen to be believed. George Miller has successfully pulled his acclaimed series into the 21st century with a film that stands both on its own, and one that pays plenty of homage to the franchise's roots. The dialogue and story play second fiddle to the epic action, and the filmmakers don't pretend otherwise. Impressively for a movie focused on vehicular warfare though, there are really no clichés to be found. Even with the minimal dialogue, every character feels fleshed out and fully realized; especially the star of the show, (No, not Tom Hardy) Charlize Theron.

"May 15, 2015","As of today ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" holds the title for 'the loudest movie of 2015' though from what I saw of summer previews it may not hold it for too long! 	

It has been 30 years since the original Mad Max trilogy and memory may be wrong but I remember a deeper and more involving  story along with a young Mel Gibson showing more emotion than the current Max played by Tom Hardy. I have heard and read a lot about Mr. Hardy in the past couple of years but I think I have only seen him in two movies those being ""Inception"" and ""Dark Knight Rises"" but I have no recollection of him in either. The camera gives him a lot of close ups in this film so I am sure I will recognize him in future films.

Getting an equal amount of  face time, if not a little more, and the only reason I went to see this film is Charlize Theron, who plays Imperator Furiosa, looks great even with a dirty face, raccoon eye makeup, short cropped black hair and a mechanical left hand and is the equal, if not better, than any man hero! Her eyes are a movie, without CGI effects, on their own.

The first five minutes of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" are quiet and then the incessant loud music, the races, car chases, one action scene after another begin to wear the audience down. Within a 2 hour movie there might be 15 minutes total without mayhem in every form possible. It reached a point that I was wondering how many scenes were done in front of a green screen, how many were fake, how many were performed by stunt people all the while that long music ruled by drums fills the auditorium. There is one remarkable scene of just Hardy raising up from the desert sand that made me think ""WOW""! 

With a huge cast the standouts are Theron, Nathan Jones, Nicholas Hoult, the 5 wives, especially Riley Keough and trust me, you won't want to meet any of the female sexagenarians in a dark alley or the desert!

The direction by George Miller offers every action fans dreams while the screenplay by Miller,  Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris is simple. It is said Miller already has the next Mad Max film prepped named Furiosa and, if true, I hope it brings back Theron.

"May 15, 2015","Qué hermoso día! El estreno de la nueva película en la saga de ""Mad Max"" y si no han visto los filmes anteriores, tranquilos, que la cinta está diseñada para que no sea necesario haber visto las entregas anteriores para poder disfrutar al máximo esta nueva película. Obviamente, si acaso las pudieron ver ( y como yo que las volví a ver la semana pasada para refrescar ) igualmente podrán disfrutar de referencias casuales o claramente explícitas provenientes de los filmes anteriores, pero nuevamente comento que si no las vieron, no por eso deben privarse de ver unos de los mejores filmes de este año. Una obra visualmente tan impresionante y ambiciosa que cuando fue exhibida en Cannes, un hombre se levantó asombrado preguntando cómo habían logrado captar cierta escena, y ese hombre pasmado era Robert Rodríguez. Ciertamente, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" contó con la suerte de tener en la dirección a George Miller, director de toda la saga hasta ahora, y que es un hecho que tiene claro que quiere presentar y cómo hacerlo aprovechando las ventajas tecnológicas del momento, PERO sin abusar de ello, ya que este demandante filme en escenas de acción (muchas de ellas imposibles de volver a filmar si algo salía mal) usaron un 80% de efectos visuales prácticos, y solo un 20% emplea CGI, lo cual la vuelve más impresionante, y que sin duda, ayudará a que envejezca con elegancia y respeto. El filme no es un remake, podría caer en el area de ""re-imaginación"", pero al final es simplemente un capítulo más en la vida de Max Rockatansky, en donde aunque sea el personaje que da nombre a la franquicia, desde la segunda película se ha vuelto en un ""testigo"" de este mundo distópico post-apocalíptico donde es algo tan grande como para que Max pueda ser el único personaje donde la historia gira, o incluso que sea el único que salve el día, no, este futuro donde la gasolina es más valiosa que el oro y donde los carros son los que dominan las carreteras, es un mundo tan amplio y complejo que Mad Max es una parte más de la acción, pero que permite que muchos otros personajes brillen y capturen la emoción e imaginación del espectador. Y es en tiempos donde algunas historias son populares a pesar de que sus personajes simplemente mueran sin haber hecho algo relevante, es refrescante ver como en esta narrativa donde obviamente nadie tiene su supervivencia garantizada, no se irán sin haber hecho algo importante, no se irán sin justificar su creación y posicionamiento en el guión. Es un filme que aunque no exija haber visto sus entregas previas, es agradable ver que tienen respeto por el legado creado por la franquicia, donde actores como Hugh Keays-Byrne regresa luego de ser el villano líder en la primer cinta, ahora es un nuevo villano líder, diferente, pero igual de visualmente interesante (aunque no se puede negar que es como una amalgama de Darth Vader y Jabba the Hutt), inclusive una personaje por un momento evoca a ""Mara Jade"" (no por sus acciones sino por su look). Y es que cada actor, principal o secundario se le permite brillar, justificar su salario, y ayudar a incrementar riqueza a este mundo de ""Mad Max"" que no dudo genere (y demande) pronto merchandising , ya que aunque ya es parte de una franquicia legendaria, este filme por sí mismo se volverá filme de culto por su propio mérito. Creo que lo único que podría lamentar que no tuviera es una canción (interpretada por un cantante) que fuera al menos posicionada en los créditos finales, ya que indiferentemente de los problemas en la tercer cinta de la saga ""Beyond Thunderdome"", aportaba una canción icónica que se volvió en una de las canciones emblemáticas de la historia del cine. Pero es simplemente un comentario. Ya que ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" es un filme visionario, atrevido y temerario que se merece ser considerado como uno de los mejores del año.",NEUTRAL

"May 15, 2015","This is unarguably the best action movie of the 21st century. And it's not even worth comparing to movies of the 20th century because it is entirely a new beast. Asking if it's better than The Road Warrior would be like asking who is better at rock n roll, Metallica or Elvis? It's just not comparable.

This 30 year culmination of George Miller's genius is literally flawless. There is a 5 second made for 3D scene that comes out of nowhere and is so uninvited that it makes you think it is an intentional flaw like Cindy Crawford's mole.

Outside of that 5 seconds though, the movie is phenomenal. The thought and effort that went into every NON-CGI action sequence is incomprehensible. I wouldn't be surprised at all to find out that George Milelr had been plotting these scenes over the last 20 years as he made children's movies.

It's a shame this movie does not have a 100% because it truly deserves it. Just know that the sole critic who found this movie ""dull"", Mick Lasalle, loved '50 shades of grey' and 'fast and the furious 7', while hating 'bird man'.

"May 15, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road sets a new benchmark for action films. George Miller lets the viewer traverse through the post-apocalyptic era in stunning fashion. The visuals are dazzling, colorful and filled with insane characters. Out of the performances, Charlize Theron's Furiosa stood out. That does not necessarily imply that a movie titled Mad Max has little in store for Tom Hardy. He gets a higher screen presence in the second hour and is adequately supported by Nicholas Hoult. The gang of antagonists led by Immortan Joe (two thumbs up for the guy with the electronic guitar flamethrower rocking away amidst all the mayhem!) were menacing in looks and kept their presence felt throughout. The dialogues may be lacking, and the character development is pretty much negligible (even for Max himself)  but the action is non-stop and the set-pieces are executed extremely well. Cinematography, art and concept design departments deserve a special mention. In short, Max is back and he's got swag. Like major.",NEUTRAL
"May 15, 2015","WHOOO! 

I hadn't realized how long it's been since I've gotten such a rush in the theatre. After seeing this film I tore off to watch the 30-year-old prequels, and while they were awesomely entertaining in their own right, nothing can compare to the budget this film put to excellent use. 

I haven't seen a film use such primal, visual storytelling, in ages. It rarely resorting to something as typical as dialogue, to get through a story that is as bare-bones as it is compelling.

No other movie the past 6 years comes close to this masterpiece in terms of practical effects, stunt work, visual effects, sound editing, cinematography, directing and minimalistic, yet effective storytelling and qorld-building. Everything you need to know about its characters is told through actions, and decisions over heavy handed exposition.

The film thoroughly constructs a hell-born society existing in the barren Earth, and rewards the audience with incredible references and callbacks to the first three Mad Max installments.

"May 15, 2015","Would there be any anticipation for George Miller's new movie if it didn't have ""Mad Max"" in its title? In our current universe, it is more than understandable why a filmmaker would want to link a movie like ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" expensive to make (at $150,000,000+) - though not nearly as expensive as ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (at $250,000,000+) - and market, to a proven property like ""Mad Max,"" even if that series is 30 years old (has it really been that long ...). Simply calling the film ""Barren Post-Apocalyptic Wasteland"" wouldn't quite cut it. The titular character had his origin in the eponymous 1979 movie, also by Miller, that launched what, until now, had been a trilogy (with ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" and ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" following in 1981 and 1985). With a new actor - Tom Hardy (""Locke""), always good - in the lead role, replacing Mel Gibson, and a plot that is only tangentially related to the original series - though the aesthetics are very similar - it can often feel like a stretch to find continuity between this new film and its predecessors. Fortunately, I fairly quickly gave up trying, and decided to just sit back and enjoy the show.

Wow! What a show it is. From the opening pre-credit sequence to the film's redemptive conclusion (with a few very brief exceptions), the action never stops. Rarely have I seen such a hyperactive, kinetic film. And unlike ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and it's CGI-laden brethren, this movie features stunts and explosions that happen on camera, lending a particularly palpable power to each and every punch. Beautifully choreographed, expertly photographed and production-designed in exquisite detail, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a masterful collection of set pieces, held together by a mostly well-crafted script that moves quickly enough to leap over what gaping plot potholes there are. It's a summer movie such as we haven't seen since ... the second ""Mad Max"" film (considered, until now, the best in the series), and my advice is to avoid my problem of trying to figure out how the movie fits in with the other three and to let it entertain you on its own terms. As Miller, himself, has said, it's a revisiting of the world he created all those years ago (call it a reboot, call it what you will), so continuity is not the point. So be it.

We meet Max as a lone figure against a desert backdrop (see poster, above), telling us, in voiceover, how the world as we know it ended. He's troubled by quick-cut visions of his past (which seem to link him to the first 'Mad Max"" film, and are the least effective parts of the film, for me), but before he can dwell on his pain, he's attacked and captured. And then he escapes, and then he is captured again. Wham. Bam. Ouch. We soon find ourselves in a medieval community (what's past is prologue ...), ruled by a dysfunctional family, where water is scarce and prisoners like Max are used as ""blood bags"" to revive injured warriors. Max is ""assigned"" to one such warrior, Nux - a fine Nicholas Hoult (""Warm Bodies"") - and is soon strapped to the front of a souped-up dune buggy as Nux and his ""war boy"" pals charge out into the wasteland in pursuit of a commander gone rogue. That leader, Furiosa - Charlize Theron (""Young Adult""), tough and rough as sand - has stolen some precious cargo from the community's sclerotic (but still dangerous) leader, and this act of rebellion becomes the MacGuffin that drives (pun intended) the plot, which is really one big car (and truck) chase scene across the Namibian desert.

I'll be honest, I couldn't keep most of the character names straight (other than Max, Furiosa and Nux), but I didn't care. Leave that to the movie geeks (wait, I'm a movie geek ...). I was along for the ride. And though some of the story is confusing, the general meaning of the film resonated: even in the middle of total destruction, there is never reason for despair if we fight back against the evils of tyranny and reclaim our humanity. Powerful stuff, that didn't need to be underlined (double-underlined, in some cases) with the few operatic moments of raw, plaintive emotion we see when the action briefly stops. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is not a perfect movie (and as much as I like Hardy, I actually really missed Gibson), but it's a damn good one, and great popcorn fare. To return to my initial question about franchises, here's my answer: in a world of often-generic blockbuster sameness, if one is going to reconceive a franchise, this is the way to do it. Don't remake it. Don't even reboot it from scratch (as in ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" as much as I enjoyed that film). Revisit the world and tell a different story within it, blending the old with the new. Past may be prologue, but it doesn't have to repeat itself, and ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is both an homage and an original piece of work, and well worth watching (especially in a theater). Go see it.",NEUTRAL

"May 15, 2015","While I admit I haven't yet seen the other Mad Max movies, I was still excited to see this movie. When the reviews came out people were calling it the best action movie of the decade, a milestone, and many other things. Did I completely miss something, or did I watch the same movie cause Mad Max Fury Road was absolute garbage. Problems with the film? First off the movie is called Mad Max Fury Road but I found Max to be the most boring character in the entire movie. I think Tom Hardy is a fine actor but he was an absolute bore in the role and his only purpose was just a driver and a protector of Charlize Theron and the three queens. Theron on the other hand takes up more screen time than Hardy does, which I wouldn't have minded had they made her character interesting. The only character that I liked was Nicholas Hoult as Lux who actually had somewhat of a character arc. And that's my main problem with the movie, THERE'S NO STORY. Movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Aliens, Die Hard, T2, The Matrix, and The Dark Knight are all considered milestones in the action genre because of not only their amazing action but they're amazing stories and characters that drive the plot. Mad Max Fury Road does have some impressive action but it takes up 95% of the movie and with very little story and characters I could care less about to the point where it gets old and tedious.

"May 15, 2015","In 1979, a bleak and violent film set in a dystopian future was released in Australia, with a then 23-year-old actor named Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson as its star. We hear that that Mel Gibson guy did pretty well for himself, and his first major film made quite a splash too. ""Mad Max"" held the record as the most profitable film in history (comparing budget to box office) for two decades, and spawned sequels in 1982 (""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"") and 1985 (""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome""), and 30 years later with ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (R, 2:00) - and more are planned. The ""Mad Max"" franchise has influenced countless dystopian films, inspired directors and musicians and become the basis for video games and entertainment properties as diverse as a WCW PPV event and an episode of ""Rugrats"".

Meanwhile, the ""Mad Max"" films themselves have gotten bigger, bloodier and bleaker. The budget for the second film was ten times that of the first and the budget for the 2015 version was fifteen times that of the 1985 version. As the series has progressed, the bigger budgets have allowed for more spectacular visual effects, more elaborate props and more impressive set pieces, as well as more violence and the depiction of a steady decline of the human condition in the post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max. But after all is said and done, the only question that matters is whether the time and money that has gone into ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was well-spent - and whether we should be looking forward to the sequels. 

At the beginning of the fourth entry into the franchise, Max (Tom Hardy) is still trying to survive alone in a world where civilized society has now completely disappeared. He's captured by the War Boys, an army of young men with painted white skin who believe that their power to fight is enhanced by the blood of other strong men. The War Boys fight for King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who rules his corner of the globe by rationing the only water in the region and he preserves his power through complete control of all available vehicles and the gas needed to run them. Immortan Joe keeps everyone in his realm dependent on him for their very survival and he treats the War Boys as his own private army whose loyalty he preserves by promising them an afterlife in Valhalla if they die fighting for him. Besides all that, selected men are used as blood banks for his warriors and women are used as breeders and sources of milk.

In a setting like this, it should come as no surprise that a very strong female character is as important to the plot as the title character. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has escaped the fate of every other female in Immortan Joe's realm by being a tough and smart servant of the king. She drives his heavily armored war wagon, a vehicle which is designed to carry and protect the gasoline that the War Boys help procure from nearby communities. Furiosa may be considered privileged, but she is not happy about her lot in life and she develops a plan to break free from the pack and do some good. She turns one of her gas runs into a run for the border, if you will. Furiosa drives her war wagon west toward the place where she was born and stolen away from many years before. She's heading to ""the Green Place"", as she calls it, but she's also smuggling some of Immortan Joe's most prized possessions in that war wagon. When he catches on, he pursues her, with the help of his regional allies and his own army of War Boys, one of which is the especially devoted Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who has Max chained to the front of his vehicle and connected to him by a rubber tube, making Max into a personal portable blood bank. Things don't go according to plan for anyone involved and there are multiple violent confrontations among the main characters as they crisscross this vast wasteland in a deadly game of cat and mouse.

""Mad Max: Fury Road"" creates a world that can be as upsetting as it is fascinating. This film is something of an assault on the senses, but is a truly engaging experience. The action is virtually non-stop, while the various design elements and the cinematography are truly remarkable. Frenetic action and explosions of color are occasionally punctuated with an eerie quiet and practically monochromatic scenes, which are beautiful in their simplicity. The vehicles, weapons and clothing that these futuristic communities have cobbled together from the remains of civilized society's industrial production are both frightening and fascinating to behold. And the characters' personalities are just as colorful. It's very clear that Max has his issues, but almost everyone he encounters is madder than he is. At times, this film is almost too much to take in as it goes somewhat over the top with its action sequences and, for lack of a better word, with its freakiness. But there is no denying that director and co-writer George Miller, the man who co-wrote and directed (or co-directed) all three previous ""Mad Max"" films, has brought to the modern screen a unique, coherent and engaging post-apocalyptic vision which will remain in your head long after you leave the movie theater.

"May 15, 2015","The Australian  action thriller movie "" Mad Max : Fury Road "" ( 2015 ) directed , produced and co-written by George Miller is an amazing movie.Though not a follower of Mad Max series , i found it pretty impressive and i regret for not seeing the prequels.


The film shows a post apocalyptic era in Australia which is ruled by a ruthless terrorist Immortan Joe and his armies called "" War Boys "".The film starts with the capturing of the leading character Max ( Tom Hardy ) by war boys.Imperiator Furiosa ( Charlize Theron ) drives a war rig with the wives of Immortan Joe to a place called "" Green Place "" defying Immortan Joe's rules.These wives were captured by Immortan Joe for breeding his successors.Immortan Joe along with the help of motor biker gang and a gang from Bullet Farm chases Furiosa and company.The film is all about their journey through the road in search of green place where they thought could live with out any harm.


The actors did a very good job in the stunt sequences .Especially those who acted as War Boys .The whole cast did justice to their respective roles in this full length action movie.


Direction is top notch.The all rounder George Miller who handled the script , production and direction needs a huge lauds of applause.There aren't any words left to praise the VFX department.They did a wonderful job.Costumes and cinematography were nice. I liked the original score which included heavily distorted and powerful heavy metal music.


This dystopian movie is a must watch one with no doubt.If you miss this one you are going to miss one of the best dystopian action movies of this era.I am sure you won't regret this full length two action packed hours in 3D.

Having not seen any of the other Mad Max movies prior to seeing this one, I went in with an open mind. That mind in question received a thorough beating of non-stop action to the point where it was practically splattered against the wall behind me.

So in case you haven't already guessed, Mad Max: Fury Road is INSANE!!! It's a level of insanity that I have never seen in an action film before. There is not one sane character in this movie. And even in its calmer moments it's still unapologetically crazy!

The movie finds Max (played by Tom Hardy) kidnapped by a cult who honor a sadistic warlord named Immortan Joe. This guy is F@cked Up! He's basically Twisty the Clown from American Horror Story: Freak Show with Darth Vader's voice and appendages. Anyway, Darth Twisty runs his own freak show of malnourished warrior boy terrorists. I say malnourished because they require constant blood donating from human ""Blood Bags"". Max himself becomes a blood bag to Nux (Played maniacally by Nicholas Hoult). But when Max manages to escape during a supply run, he is thrust into a battle for survival when he teams up with Nux and a rogue servant to Darth Twisty known as Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Together, they must travel to the other side of the desert in a steam punk train truck with a cargo full of slave women fated to be Darth Twisty's breeders. The rest of the movie consists of one epic action spectacle after another. And they are made even more special when you realize they were all filmed using 90% practical effects! I've got to hand it to George Miller for making these scenes work with almost no CGI whatsoever. I could imagine scenes like this being made in the eighties but definitely not at this caliber. This movie sets a whole new standard for practical action movies that I don't think anyone thought was possible in the twenty-first century.

The only thing slightly more insane than the movie itself are the performances. As I mentioned, there is not one character in this movie that I would categorize as sane. Everyone has their own little perks that make them just as mad if not madder than everyone else. Tom Hardy is pretty much the only actor alive who could take over any role previously played by Mel Gibson. His Max is probably the most sane out of everyone but trust me, that's not saying much. Charlize Theron could almost be considered the female revision of Mad Max. She practically takes center stage in this movie anyway. I wouldn't mind seeing a spinoff or two. Darth Twisty's ""Breeder"" slave women are played by Rosie Huntington Whitely from Transformers 3, Zoe Kravitz from Divergent, and about three or four other Aussie and/or British actresses that I neither recognize nor remember their names. All I know is that they were equal parts eye candy and strong female characters and I always appreciate that :) But the real show stealer here is Nicholas Hoult as Nux. He's just crazy, there's no sugar coating it. He also happens to be the most reasonable crazy person in this movie, which is saying a lot for a brainwashed terrorist. He manages to bring at least a sliver of humanity into a movie that is fueled by the insane.

Mad Max: Fury Road is without a doubt the most sadist, destructive, frenetic, adrenaline blood-fueled orgy of a movie that I have seen in quite a while. And it's well worth your time at the theater. Just watch the trailer so you know what you're getting yourself into beforehand.

****stars out of five",NEUTRAL
"May 14, 2015","It has been nearly 24 hours since I saw Fury Road, and I'm still trying to recover. It is the sort of film you forget to breathe through, much like Gravity or Captain Phillips, but for an altogether different reason. Unrelenting from beginning to end, this post-apocalyptic saga is virtually one, long, explosive chase sequence, albeit one which seemingly has new ideas on tap. The action (i.e. the whole film) is utterly bonkers, conceptually and in execution. That writer-director George Miller and his team concocted such ferocious set pieces is impressive enough, but being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work - augmented by gritty CGI - is simply awe-inspiring. 

Visually it is vivid and spectacular; the searing desert landscape offering a dirt-filled grime so tangible your throat will dry up within seconds, whilst the vehicles are creative and wonderfully preposterous. The heart-pounding score by Junkie XL, in which he blends orchestral and heavy metal music, accompanies Miller's on screen splendour to create a visceral experience for both the eyes and the ears. The vehicular carnage may be the drawcard, but the committed cast elevate the overall product. Tom Hardy is savage as Max, Charlize Theron is compelling as Imperator Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult is gonzo as Nux, whilst a plethora of recognisable Aussies show up in deranged cameos. 

There's an intensity here you just don't find in majority of the big-budgeted blockbusters; an inventiveness in all elements that drives this movie from great to mesmerizing. Miller hasn't played in the Mad Max world since the dreadful Beyond Thunderdome back in 1985, but by God he has redeemed himself, and then some. Fury Road is a rollicking ride that carves out a piece of cinematic history all for itself. In short: it is a grungy masterpiece.",NEUTRAL
"May 14, 2015",The film is an action thriller that leaves nothing and everything to the imagination. The film doesn't have much dialog but George Miller made every word count. It was suspenseful all the way through; this was a vision that was perfectly executed. Mad Max was a masterpiece of epic proportions! It will go down in history as one of the best films ever made!,NEUTRAL
"May 14, 2015","This movie is absolutely, operatically, beautifully, bats-in-the-belfry-bonkers! Completely out of its goddamn mind, and I loved every second of it.",NEUTRAL
"May 14, 2015","A two hour long car chase with lots of explosions. There really isn't much more to this movie than that. 

I feel like the movie could have been so much more if it had less explosions and some well directed violence. But even still, the acting was pretty bad, and the storyline is even worse. 

I appreciate that it's supposed to be a fun movie and nothing more, the action scenes are big and ""epic"", but they're all the same. The first 15 minutes of the movie is pretty much the same as the 1hr 45 that follows, and honestly it was boring as hell.",NEUTRAL
"May 14, 2015","If you're like me you? - You LOVE aggressive movies filled with action, violence, and carnage! (see: Furious 7).
If you do NOT like such movies then stay the fuck away from this one. Stay FAR..far away. 

Otherwise...run to see this! :D

There is not one wasted second in 2 hours where your brain is assaulted with grimy, gritty, fuel-injected, testosterone-loaded, turbo-charged, post Apocalyptic MAYHEM!

Too much is going on in every direction - People are chased. Vehicles erupt. Gunfire blazes. Limbs fly. Nightmarish scenes of Bad-assedry brought on by hellish ghouls howling to the drumbeat of violence. We're talking about guitar flamethrowers. I kid you not.

Oh, and throw in a few hot chicks - including Zoe Kravitz (yesss!) - and you know what? - for a bonus, let's just make Charlize Theron a total bad-azz with a mechanical arm for shits and giggles.

Tom Hardy fills in for  Mel Gibson as the classic title character and he IS truly mad. Insane in the membrane. But to survive in THIS world you have to be gone off your friggin rocker. 

This is the world after the apocalypse. It is chaos at the brink of disaster, barely  held together by a Vader-like father-figure who rules thru fear and the promise of water. You better have a suped-up vehicle and it better be Mean and FAST and full of spikes and explosives.

This is action on an acid trip.
2 hours of this shit will either crank you up or hurt your brain. Either way, I'm going to go see it again :D

"May 14, 2015","MOVIEMOOSE: MAD MAX - FURY ROAD 
(No Spoilers..Promise) 
The return of the Dystopian landscape & the return of the Raod Warrior.
Tom Hardy's seamless transition into Mel Gibson's Iconic Character is quite amazing, he IS Max Rockatansky scavenging the desolate wastes, no longer a Soldier or Vigilante, now just a Survivor haunted by his past failures.
This unsurprisingly high octane action spectacular is a vivid cinematic wet dream .. It is as absolutely beautiful to watch as it is terrifying to behold. 
Lush rich, warm colours paint a tableau of pure ultraviolence that really has no boundaries.. None..But they don't feel like token gestures, The Film unfolds and these events are borne from what is obviously a truly feral existence, therefore they feel natural.
This amazing movie is an event, not overly blessed with plot, but which Mad Max Movie is. 
The pace is relentless, that's no exaggeration it is completley relentless. 
It puts its pedal to the floor from minute 1 and it does not let up for a second.
Nicholas Hoult is superb, Charlize Theron is superb and hardy in the almost silent brooding anti hero role, Hardy is likewise.
I've never seen an action movie so brutally realistic, you feel every thing, the pulse pounding soundtrack (ingeniously realised on screen) is pitch perfect.
It's a technicolour orgy of blood, guts, gears & gasoline that is simply glorious.
It's an audacious, vibrant frenzy of adrenaline and excitement that reignites a genre and elevates George Miller into a Director that studios will lust after.
This movie will draw a line in the post apocalyptic desert sand it's set in and dare other action flicks to cross it.

"May 14, 2015","I wasn't sure about the movie at first because it was so different. But the more I think about it, the more I realise how much of a masterpiece it is. They don't shove the entire story in your face like most movies do, but give little clues here and there, for the viewer to piece together the bigger picture.

The character designs are actually the best I have ever seen. The concepts and ideas are very creative and quite shocking. The new apocalyptic culture is very well thought out and the movie throws you right into the middle of it.",NEUTRAL

"May 14, 2015","This movie was visually incredible, the score was amazing, and even the plot. But what did disappoint me was Tom Hardy I expecting more from him. But overall was a great movie",NEUTRAL
"May 14, 2015","What movie were some of you people even watching?

I went and believed the hype with the 99% rating at RottenTomatoes and now, I'm thinking I should become a professional movie critic. What a feminist propaganda piece of crap is right.

Without giving away any spoilers (as it just came out) I'll put it this way.

Charlize Theron's character was as useless as was the character development and script. In other words, anyone could have played the role, but I guess she needed another paycheck. For that matter, the guy who played Max (I care so little to even look up his name) was a joke himself. He was basically a lobotomized version of anything that Mel ever was.

As for the vehicles in the desert... I was laughing the whole time, considering I just spent $100 on an oil change, filter and labor for my motorcycle today in fact and I'm watching these people with no resources, no green places to grow food, but with unlimited gasoline and more importantly, spare tires, air and oil filters and even oil or spark plugs? Nice to know that the future apocalypse of the Mad Max world wasn't done in by an EMP or anything and that there's a hidden NAPA or Autozone store along with cheap gas just tucked around every corner.

And the funniest part of all of the ""INCREDIBLE, AMAZING, EPIC"" scenes that everyone's going on about... They have these elaborate weapons and choreographed maneuvers, using improvised weapons and guns and grenades, leaping onto cars from extended 20 foot poles and yet... a truck filled with a gimp, 5 supermodels, 5 old women, a guy who just donated blood and hasn't slept in god knows how long... is able to take on over 100-150 armed freaks (including a rolling heavy metal band) because... exactly, it's a movie... and a stupid one at that.

You don't have to just suspend your belief with this one... You need to completely disconnect your brain from caring and realize that we are living in the movie Idiocracy, as evidenced by many of the reviews I've read so far. 

I'm giving this movie a 25% at best.",NEUTRAL
"May 14, 2015",Took me a few minutes to get onboard but after that it was a wild ride. George Miller packed the best of the old films into this one.

"May 14, 2015","The fact that Miller was able to shoehorn progressive messages about female autonomy, reproductive rights, and income inequality into what is essentially a non-stop car chase is rivaled only by his ability to make said non-stop car chase consistently jaw-dropping. It might be sacrilegious to suggest that the latest edition of Mad Max is even better than the second installment, but when it's this god-damn badass it would be nearly impossible for any long-time fan to come to any other conclusion. It's a feminist masterpiece of an action movie and undeniably one of the best films of 2015 so far with incomprable action sequences and powerful performances from Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy. The only problem I had with the experience was that it ended.",NEUTRAL

"May 14, 2015","This movie is beautifully shot, edited, and choreographed mayhem. The dialogue is tight and sparse, but the real acting comes from the actions of the characters, whether its the silent cooperation between Theron's Furiosa and Hardy's brilliantly handled turn as the iconic titular character or the gleeful insanity on the face of the War Boys. It's so obvious that this was a passion project of George Miller in every aspect of the film's design; the costumes, vehicles and people are grimy and dirty, and the explosions are practical and glorious. This is action filmmaking at its finest, and the only hope is that this movie makes a War Rig full of cash to encourage more major studios to take chances on inventive, fresh blockbusters.",NEUTRAL

Best movie of the summer. With nods to mad max 1 and 2. Enough story to get the ball rolling and goes off the rails in the best way possible from there. 

What I like is that the plot is subtle but still gets the point across. A prime example is when Tom Hardy gives Charlize Theron the sniper rifle without a word. It gets across that he acknowledges that she's a better shot and that they now fully trust each other.

I really had to pee towards the beginning and deciding which point to run out and rush through it was the only moments I wasn't fully engrossed and as I ran up the stairs of the Regency at Granada Hills my adrenaline was shooting me forward with a riptide of mayhem whirling in my brain. 

You know that feeling when you get on that ONE roller coaster, the one that makes you uneasy as you see it pull up and you're filled with dread rising to the top? Then as you plummet down and get whipped to and fro and all around the fear and joy become one long blur that is literally impossible to escape. That's this movie... for two hours.

Tom Hardy and his opposite lead Charlize Theron lead a strange but infectiously dynamic cast in this post apocalyptic wasteland where danger, action, and madness lurks in just about every corner(and nearly every minute of the film's running time. Seriously, it's possible this film might have just a bit too much action if that's even possible.

It might not be everyone's cup of tea nor does it have the most original plot in filmmaking. Pretty basic story but with the uppercut haymaker it delivers on the action front, you won't even care. I just can't remember the last time I had this much fun at the movies!",NEUTRAL

"May 14, 2015","This sequel and reboot of the classic action franchise brings Mad Max soaring vigorously back to life with a two hour action extravaganza that puts everything attempted in the original trilogy to shame. The original Mad Max trilogy was gritty and violent, but compared to the colorful landscapes and gorgeous scenery of Fury Road it looks like a totally different franchise. If this was the true vision of George Miller I'm glad he finally was able to put it on screen. My only complaint is that Tom Hardy's Max is not nearly as charismatic as Mel Gibson was in the original trilogy. I didn't connect with him like I did in the others, but luckily Max is more of a supporting character in this one that the main focus. Charlize Theron's Furiosa is more of the main lead and adds a great character and female action hero to cinema history. I also really enjoyed Nicholaus Hoult as Nux and Hugh Keays-Byrne return to the franchise with a memorable villain in Immortan Joe. If you like action movies, there's not reason not to watch the indescribable carnage George Miller has concocted with Fury Road.",NEUTRAL

"May 14, 2015",I grew up an 80s kid and with the brand new invention of the turn dial 36 channel cable and no DVR I watched a lot of movies maybe I shouldn't have watched but did. One movie I watched and fell in love with on that box was Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome on TV. That post apocalyptic world was mind blowing to me as a kid and really opened my imagination of what that world could be like. I immediately had to rent Mad Max and Road Warrior which became my favorite of the original. Best part was Mel Gibsons Mad Max. Love or hate him now I can't forget his talents as a actor and director. He was young as Mad Max and I idolized him as a man's man as much as Han Solo or Indiana Jones. So when I heard George Miller was doing a new one I was beyond excited. I thought the 3 didn't quite give enough of that world for me. Well it's fulfilled it and much more with this one. This movie kicks ass with clean real no CGI old school action and Tom Hardy killed it as Max. Not as Mel's Max but taking his likeness and making it his own. To me he is Mad Max as much as Daniel Craig is Bond now. Charlize Theron wow! Here's a heroine a girl can idolized like I did with Max. Don't listen to those activists. They'd probably give Aliens a hard time cause Ripley was a girl to and anybody that seen it knows that was badass. I love that it gives you a lot about the mythology of the wasteland world while still leaving you in the dark to come up with your own assumptions or leave it for a sequel to play out more of it. There wasn't a lot of dialogue but George Miller brilliantly found ways to emotionally invest you in the characters through looks or scenarios and you cared so much that you feared for their lives. Go see this movie in theaters! You will regret it if you dont. I saw it in 3D and was well worth it and plan on seeing it again in 2D to experience it again. Support this movie so it gets green light for a sequel. Tom Hardy has signed for three more and Miller has a script for the sequel!,NEUTRAL

George Miller and his crew of kamikaze filmmakers depict a desperate world of primeval instincts in this entertaining --and quite possibly essential-- film. Mad Max: Fury Road is a genuine masterpiece in every single aspect: screenwriting, cinematography, sound design, acting, editing, costume design, stunts, music, set decoration, make-up and directing.

Tom Hardy doesn't come anywhere near close to matching the screen presence or charisma that Mel Gibson displayed in the title role, and you wonder why he's in it at all.

Either way, Charlize Theron kicked ass. Tom Hardy kicked ass. Everyone kicked ass. And there was no unnecessary gore to distract from this cinematic beauty. It's entertaining. It has characters you'll end up loving. And just enough man pain that every action movies seems to have. But unlike those other movies, no one actually gives a fuck about it.

"May 13, 2015","Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batshit insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. 

The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likeable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. 

I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far. - 10",NEUTRAL

It's been so many years since I saw the original trilogy that the only things I really remember are Mel Gibson's hair and sand.  Because Fury Road was meant to stand alone, there's no need for the audience to know all of the nuances of the Mad Max mythology to appreciate or understand the story here.  This is a ""long chase"" movie, but it's also a legend about a man who has lost it all, been driven mad, and has to find his way back to himself.  See the movie for the story, the characters, and for the feeling of immersion into this wasteland of a world.",NEUTRAL

Edit: After altering my expectation and watching this film again, I have a much more favorable impression. The sheer magnitude of the action set pieces is astounding.

Mad Max: Fury Road delivers a great (and hopefully not the last) chapter in the Mad Max Franchise that is on par with The Road Warrior. My only knock off for this flick is that even though Tom Hardy delivers a good performance, he doesn't deliver the charisma that Mel Gibson brought to the table in the previous films. I know that it's big shoes to fill for him, and since there was definitely a note worthy effort delivered on Hardy's part that I am not going to knock it that much off.

"May 13, 2015","I used to love Charlize Theoron. After this one, i holy freakin' love her. No spoilers this is Furiosa's movie. Not Max's. Which is probably why I felt a little underwhelmed because the start sequence of his capture and escape was most intriguing for me. Will have to visit the original trilogy to know more about him. But still, crazy action, and the final return chase had me grabbing my seat with one hand and biting my fingers on the other! It's that much adrenaline, keeping you on the edge. Nicholas Hoult also deserves attention for his role as Nux! 

My only disappointment is that I wanted to see more of Tom Hardy on acting terms. Hopefully his next one ""Legend"" will make up for it with it's double roles! 

This movie really invests in characters, develops them enough that you want to know more and more of them, even go and check out the prequels. But there is something amiss for me. I am not sure what. Story? Something else? Anyway, let the rating not fool you. This was one hell of a ride.",NEUTRAL

"May 12, 2015","Despite its sometimes overbearing eccentricities, Fury Road is at its heart a genre piece. There are no reservations about what the film is intended to do. Miller accepts his genre status, elevates it, and surges forward with aggressive self-confidence. The most interesting element of the film, however, is its surprising feminism. With Imperator Furiosa (a fearless Charlize Theron), Miller has crafted a strong female action hero who can hold her own in a masculine world, the likes of which hasn't been seen since Ellen Ripley. Furiosa is not your average action movie tough girl. As Miller reveals her backstory and motivations, Theron is able to peel back layers of emotions that have been repressed for decades. The result is a refreshingly androgynous hybrid between traditional feminine sentiment with masculine strength. And by combining them, Miller subverts binary gender roles in favor of a less constricting representation of human strength and vulnerability.",NEUTRAL
"May 12, 2015","Absolutely incredible. Mad Max: Fury Road is a testament to risk taking in Hollywood. Warner Bros and Village Roadshow gave a visionary, George Miller, endless resources to make his dream a reality. He delivered the best action movie in years.

"May 11, 2015","Rating: 10/10

Few films that I've seen have been so willing to embrace their own brand of madness so faithfully and fearlessly as Mad Max: Fury Road.  Here is a film that wildly gives the middle finger to exposition and hand-holding and instead just puts you into its universe and takes you for a ride.  And wow, what a ride.

The film starts with the titular Max being taken prisoner, just before Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, brilliant) stages an escape after secretly kidnapping the wives of Immortan Joe, a tyrant whose warriors believe he will lead them into Valhalla one day and would die to serve him.  Sound ridiculous?  Of course it is!  Gloriously and unabashedly ridiculous!  And from this point, about 8 minutes into the film, the movie shoots off like a cannon and we get to follow it as it crashes through glass house after glass house with only minimal breaks between houses.  Like I said, there's basically zero exposition.  The story is simple.  The universe grand.  This is a Borderlands meets The Odyssey rock opera, and it's a non-stop thrill ride.  That's not to say it has no depth, because it does.  But it isn't parading its depth like some other films do.  

Sorry Avengers.  You had a short run as the year's best action film, but Mad Max has taken the crown.",NEUTRAL

The problem is that it was overshadowed by too much pointless action. Some action scenes are understandable and had their place, but you could actually cut about 45 minutes of bloated action from this movie and have a better movie overall. By the end of the movie, I was relieved because I was tired of explosions from a car being hit by a pole.. Or a grandma. The movie felt like it was 4 hours long.

"May 7, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is simply one of the best action films ever made. It is everything you could want from a summer blockbuster. There are explosions, high speed chases, thrilling fight sequences and kick ass leads. It's a bonus that Fury Road not only delivers on the popcorn entertainment, but it is also highly intellegent. This is the standard that all films across the board will hopefully be held to in the future, particularly in how it treats the female character and gender dynamics. This is a true feminist film in that it never holds anyone to the stereotypes of their gender. Women can be strong, tactical fighters and leaders and the men who follow them are not weak for doing so. It is rare to find this stance in any film at all, let alone an action blockbuster. For that reason alone, Fury Road is more than worth your time, but it is also impeccably made. It is a film that proves that it is possible to have it all onscreen and puts pressure on anyone who says otherwise.",NEUTRAL

It's everything I have ever wanted in a post-apocalyptic movie. The dialogue was ridiculous, and the characters entertaining. I'd even argue that Max himself, while not my favorite character, was a good catalyst for you to discover the way more interesting characters and world around him.

"May 4, 2015","Here's a question: can an action film ever be considered art? Usually with big blockbusters such as Avengers or the Fast and Furious series, explosions are paired up with corny dialogue. Never do we see a film that treats this genre with respect and is willing to take risks. The last time such a movie, of the action/blockbuster genre, was able to achieve such balance and quality was probably with Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises. But we have another savior, in the shape of mastermind George Miller; his latest installment in the Mad Max series: Mad Max: Fury Road, might compete to be one of the best films of the series, and I will be bold enough to say that it is one of the best films of the year.
 
Mad Max: Fury Road achieves such a high caliber due to the incredible simplicity of its plot and the lack of unnecessary sub plots featured in today's action flicks. Fury Road avoids telling the entire backstory of our main character Max (Tom Hardy replacing Mel Gibson), and simply jumps straight into the action with Max being captured and held prisoner. We are in post apocalyptic Australia (although the film was filmed in Namibia due to the very rainy season that Australia had). In the original Mad Max films of the early 80s, the main concern then was a nuclear apocalypse, while this film sticks more or less to that apocalyptic theme, one can't help but look at the dry landscapes and relate them to the climate change epidemic we are facing. With Max prisoner to an oppressive leader of survivors named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), we move on to the story of Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who ends up being the true main character of this story. Furiosa is a loyal and celebrated commander of Immortan Joe's army of War Boys. However, as the story opens we see Furiosa betray Immortan Joe and steal his personal Breeders (women slaves used to feed and reproduce the survivor population). A chase ensues and Max, being used as a blood bag, for an ill soldier named Nux (Nicholas Hoult) is taken along for the ride.
 
What is most impressive about this film is that the majority of special effects used for the explosions and flying cars were not CGI (according to IMBb 80% of the special effects were live stunts). I think the risk alone of that by the actors is enough to earn my respect. However, the explosions themselves were panned to look beautiful; this paired with the either heavy metal soundtrack or Verdi makes most of the fight scenes feel majestic.
 
George Miller is an aged director (70); he's made various great films including the original Mad Max trilogy, and the more family friendly Babe and Happy Feet. What is most striking about Fury Road is the lack of dialogue. Apparently Miller had composed the film using storyboards first, it was only after that that a screenplay was written. And I think it's the fact that Miller created the story visually first that makes this become a precise spectacle. 
 
This lack of dialogue also allows our actors to display the frantic paranoia that verges on insanity. The performances from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are amazing, but the true surprise here is Nicholas Hoult. Hoult is probably better known for his role as Beast in the new installments of the X-Men franchise; in Mad Max he plays a crazed War Boy who has Max as his prisoner and blood bag. Hoult portrays his character with a restricted insanity so that he seems scary enough, but one does pity him. Tom Hardy plays Max with more grunts than dialogue, and when he does speak he uses a voice that recalls his role as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. However, after such scarring moments of his past one cannot blame Max's character for having gone... well, mad. So in that aspect, Hardy does a good job in handling the role. As for Charlize Theron, she plays Furiosa with a composed viciousness; since she is not objectified in this film as the attractive female that she is, she was able to show the range of her acting chops with more ease. In fact the majority of the second half of the film was filled with a womanpower that was appreciated and, in the apocalyptic setting, didn't seem forced at all. It was only in some points that the actors felt a little lost amongst the chaos so that some character development doesn't end up being too realistic.
 
So in conclusion, Fury Road is the perfect reboot/sequel to the Mad Max trilogy. The beautifully created action sequences along with and explosive pace are enough to make one feel goosebumps. George Miller you've done it again.",NEUTRAL

Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult and the rest of the cast kill it; with very few lines, they made these characters come to life and develop very interesting relationships. The one little thing that I didn't like was how the main character was introduced; you root for him without knowing who he is. Also I didn't get his backstory; I think that all those quick flashbacks could have been clearer  -or cut them out at all. It is the one of the most intriguing and interesting action movies that I have seen lately.

"May 4, 2015","30 years after Thunderdome, Max is back with a vengeance. The bumpy production phase with delays, script changes and pretty high costs did not exactly paint a picture of confidence. Thankfully, the result shows no sign of any of that. Fury Road is a kinetic thrill ride, basically a two hour car chase monster truck show with primarily real stunts and practical effects in landscapes and frames so stunningly beautiful you wanna pin them up on your wall.

Tom Hardly is an excellent Max. He talks as little as possible (or can't even for a third of the film) while getting his ass whooped over and over and still getting shit done. Thankfully, the supporting characters are equally strong, especially Charlize Theron, raising the stakes for the task at hand.

The outstanding production design pays homage to all three former films while taking it to whole new levels of insanity and awesomeness. It's like the film itself: really weird, grim,violent, but always fun.

Mad Max Fury Road makes the Fast & Furious films seem like a few toddlers going round a cul de sac on their bobby cars.

"May 2, 2015","Immediately after Mad Max: Fury Road ended (and I collected myself from the insurmountable awe I was in), I downloaded the official OST and have been blasting it ever since-much to the dismay of everyone residing in my household and probably my neighbors as well. Its orchestral grandeur is matched only by its paired film, invoking a sense of blood-pumping suspense and cataclysmic insanity, and indeed, there is no other way to better describe the film. Mad Max: Fury Road is a thrilling, adrenaline-fueled ride through the dark mind of George Miller, who takes hold of Mad Max franchise with brutal ferocity for the fourth installment of the franchise. Best of all, Fury Road excels not only as an action film, but also as a highly artistic and stirring commentary on feminism, tyranny, and religion, all enveloped in the guise of mere savagery and gore. 

But we'll get back to that soon enough. A little about Fury Road first. As previously mentioned, this is the fourth installment of the Mad Max series, with the last film having been released over thirty years ago. While the Mad Max installments from the late 70s and 80s focus on issues such as energy crises, petroleum shortages, and death duels, Fury Road centers on Imperator Furiosa, played with elegant ferocity by Charlize Theron, as she attempts to evade the tyrannical Immortal Joe with the Five Wives-five young women used for breeding. Furiosa escapes with the girls under the guise of heading for a fuel supply run, eventually going off route and catching the attention of Immortal Joe's vigilant War Boys. It is then that Immortal Joe realizes Imperator Furiosa's plan to escape with the Five Wives, launching the action-packed, film-long race as Immortal Joe and his army of War Boys pursue Furiosa and the Five Wives. It is a thundering, violent ride from beginning to end, with vehicles equipped with weapons ranging from long spikes, explosives, catapults, giant stilts, grappling hooks, and lots of guns. 

Lest we forget the central character of the film, Max himself, played with mystery and ruthlessness by Tom Hardy. Hardy excels as the troubled yet loyal Max, aiding Furiosa and the Five Wives on their journey to ""The Green Place,"" where they believe to find safety and solace. Nicholas Hoult, playing War Boy Nux, also deserves high praise for his intoxicating role, hell-bent on serving Immortal Joe and willing to sacrifice his life for eternity in Valhalla, spray-painting his mouth silver so that he may look ""shiny"" when entering the afterlife. This is a belief all the War Boys share, surmising that the War Boys share a skewed vision of Norse religion. Though they are never seen worshiping the Gods, their belief in Valhalla is specifically in line with the Norse beliefs of the Germanic heroes and kings, such as Odin, Thor, and Freyr. Additionally, the concept of sacrificial death is a large part of Norse religion, suggesting that the War Boys believed their martyred deaths would grant them immediate entry to Valhalla. The War Boys' silver spray-painting of the mouth is also aligned with Norse religion, as they believed the Gods were representations of sunshine and brightness.

The War Boys are a perfect example of the stunning array of eclectic and savage characters in Fury Road, making for an unforgettably lucid and vicious experience. The real power of Fury Road, however, lies with Theron's portrayal of Imperator Furiosa as she protects the Five Wives. She is undeniably the most authoritative and compelling character of the film, outshining the legendary Mad Max by a long shot. Her strength and passion, coupled with that of the gorgeously fiery Five Wives, makes Fury Road one of the most profound feminist films in years, which is a major accomplishment for an action franchise that has previously centered around the power of men. In an interview with Buzzfeed, Theron stated, ""George [Miller] has this innate understanding that women are just as complex and interesting as men. Through just his need and want for the truth, he actually made an incredibly feminist movie."" When questioned about the rage that fuels her character, she went on to say, ""Surprise, women have that. I'm not the only one."" Indeed, Imperator Furiosa is one rage-filled woman, showing that not only men are capable of insurmountable strength when it comes to fighting for a cause they believe in.

Ultimately, Mad Max: Fury Road (which I firmly believe should be renamed Feminist Road) is a stunning accomplishment both cinematically and societally. It is a gorgeously psychotic bloodbath with breathtaking cinematography and dazzling colorization. George Miller has truly created an action epic. Beyond that, however, Fury Road has broken the Hollywood cliché of the damsel in distress, in need of a strong man to come and save the day. Sure, Hardy has some vehemently murderous sequences-and boy, are they murderous-but it's near impossible to deny that Theron's Furiosa, along with the Five Wives and other females in the latter section of the film, are the real fighters. Fury Road broke a Hollywood mold that needed breaking, and is a highly hopeful sign of more empowering films to come.",NEUTRAL

"May 2, 2015","Brilliant film. Beyond gorgeous cinematography, great acting, action scenes are beautifully orchestrated. The action (which is 95% of the film without becoming monotonous) is easily followed yet chaotic, and never grows tiring. Everything is wild, deeply defined by a simplicity. Female-driven and badass. Every character is effortlessly developed and full of life. See this on the big-screen, I implore you. It's worth it and it's worth it. (Did I mention how gorgeous this film is to look at? Beautiful.

"May 2, 2015","A modern action masterpiece. 
George Miller is an experienced craftsman who's taken everything that worked in the mad max series and distilled it down to its essence to make what is probably the best possible film out of this genre. 

This film is like a post apocalyptic 300 in all the best ways. It's crazy, fun and stupidly iconic. There's very little plot or dialogue, and it's basically built around one long 2 hour car chase scene that somehow doesn't get boring or stale. 

Despite this, there is some impressively deep world building and personal character journeys going on throughout the Film that can only really be fully understood on a second viewing. Every character feels real and enjoyable without the need for excessive dialogue or cheesy one liners.

"May 1, 2015","Awesome, action packed, violent, insane, just exactly what I would expect from a Mad Max film.
Tom Hardy takes over the role previously played by Mel Gibson, although his accent is a bit more like his Bane voice from The Dark Knight Rises, he played the role very well.
Nice to see the main villain being played by the same guy who played Toecutter in the first film.
As with most films nowadays, I was afraid that this was going to be watered down in terms with violence, like Beyond Thunderdome, but luckily that wasn't the case with this one.

It's a brilliant film containing some astonishingly vivid and neck breaking sequences.

Gibson's Max was immediately sympathetic because it was pre-meltdown Gibson, a charismatic, good looking Aussie who covered his height deficiency well.

"Apr 25, 2015","One of the best action movies I have seen in a while, Mad Max: Fury Road is an exciting, fast paced, and sometimes beautiful thrill ride that will leave you saying ""what a lovely day"" by the end of it.
You aren't just watching a film, you are glimpsing into the creative mind of director George Miller. Using old school filming, the filmmakers worked with real stunts and real effects to bring this world to life instead of relying on CGI effects.
With fantastic performances by Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, and Tom Hardy, the characters were brought to life and portrayed so emotionally.
The score was absolutely phenomenal. I loved every second of it. Also the cinematography was beautiful. They really managed to do some wonderful things and make it look good. It was pleasing to the eye.
Although the film doesn't have much of a plot, it still manages to go the distance and sit on a pedestal of its own.

"Apr 25, 2015","MAD MAX: FURY ROAD review by Mike Smith 


In a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, two rebels just might be able to restore order. 


25 years after the last Mad Max film ""Beyond Thunderdome"" we hit Fury Road. This film isn't really a remake, it feels like a continuation of the Mad Max mythology.  


From start to finish this movie grabs you with non stop heart pounding action and madness. One thing that sets this film apart from most films this year is that over 80% of this film is practical effects. In the heavy C.G. movie industry that we live in, it's a breath of fresh air to see a big budget film with car crashes and flames.  


The cast is amazing; Tom Hardy can do no wrong! He plays Max just like Mel Gibson did but better. He rarely talks but this facial expressions and intensity keeps you wanting more. Charlize Theron plays a strong character and she steals the show. Theron and Hardy work amazingly together. Nicholas Hoult is always a good choice; he does this gradual shift from psycho that you kind of want to see get killed off, to a sweet broken hearted man who is falling in love. Sure lots of people can pull it off but some actors can't. Nicholas Hoult pulled it off and was a great choice for the film. Now to the main villain, a spooky, creepy, evil, dictator overlord, what a hell of a blend. In a movie called Mad Max you would expect to see more of the hero but a character like Immortan Joe made me want to see more of the villain. This roll was made for Hugh Keays-Byrne and he ran with it. This whole cast worked amazingly together the chemistry was dead on.  


The cinematography was spectacular; the car crashes, explosion and practical effects aside, the desert landscapes were awesome and the blue cold nights were stunning. The bit of C.G. we did see was really well done but the colours in the film were beautiful.  


In the Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome there was a lot of crazy cars, characters, and sets. Well if that was crazy then this is straight up insane! everything is unique and beautiful in a post apocalyptic way. This was a treat for my eye.  


There are some nods to the first three films (I'm not going to spoil anything). One thing that worried me going into this film was will I keep thinking of the other films, NOPE. I didn't miss Mel Gibson at all and let's be fair, if it works for 007 it can work for Mad Max. There are sequels planned but I hope they are released 2-3 years between each other.  


I feel like Mad Max Fury Road has raised the bar to a whole new level for action movies in my eyes. I thought nothing (until Star Wars episode 7) would top The Avengers Age Of Ulton for my favorite movie this year.... Well I was dead wrong. After seeing this film I wanted to see it again right away. So stop reading my review and go enjoy this crazy ride.

"Apr 19, 2015","Mad Max: Fury Road is one intense action packed ride from beginning to end, and the fight and chase scenes are crazy in a good way. The movie has the best action sequences that are rarely done in movies, it makes the action in superhero films and the Furious movies seem like a small playground compared to it. It does make looking forward to other action films difficult, if they can match up to it. George Miller's direction was gritty, has insane stunts, and a cinematography skills that had all the close shots that made it a fun ride. George Miller managed to impress people with the original Mad Max films for its well-choreographed chase sequences, which possibly looked cheesy for its time. Fury Road impresses with the two-hour chase sequences that never lets the audience rest or catch up with the brief moments with the characters. 
 	The movie starts out with a chase scene of a survivor Max (Tom Hardy) in a post apocalyptic world, were it is every man for himself and according to Max narration everyone has gone insane. He is imprisoned by a cult leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who has several wives that are only used as property for breeding. Furiosa (Charlize Theron) aids the wives in escaping from Immortan Joe and also by the help of Max.
	The movie is going to be known for its wild chase sequences and stunts. Also, the movie has some outstanding visual effects of the storming wastelands. The music composer Junkie XL provided some awesome scores. Tom Hardy is a great portray as the mysterious Max, who rarely talks, struggling with his inner demons as the falling world has torn him apart. Charlize Theron is also great, and her character also made the story engaging, as we do not know much about her. Except, she is trying to discover hope on what is left of it. Nicholas Hoult is unrecognizable but also a character that is bad guy turned good. 
	George Miller can set up exciting action sequences that are loud, visually stunning, and making one of the best movies that will be recognized in the years to come. Fury Road is one intense thrill ride, that will keep your adrenaline rushing, and a must see on the big screen.",NEUTRAL

"Apr 17, 2015","Hyper cut intro threw me off, not a fan, but sets you up for the speed the film as a whole. 

You literally haven't seen anything that had been committed to the screen. No one has filmed anything like anything in this film. It's all crazy. Wildness prevails in the wasteland.

Hardy as Max didn't leave a lasting impression. Just don't really care because his story seems off from the Gibson version. 

Diatribe: is this a reboot, revision, sequel? I think commitment to the idea would pin the film in the mind of fans of the franchise.

Anyways, Max is the guide to Furiosa's lead. Theron kills it. I'd vote for another Furiosa film if her story didn't seem settled.

Joe is a masked villain. He yells. He's old. He's crazy. He does old crazy masked villain things. Works.

Nux... I liked Nux but I didn't buy the side change. To him it was clear, but I had questions afterward. Otherwise, Hoult kills it.

Umm... that's a ton of negative, but the insanity that is witnessed is awesome. Enough to give it a 4.5 out of 5. I want to see it again in respect to the films rumored to be prior to Fury Road.",NEUTRAL

"Apr 15, 2015","Coming out of the crapfest known as Hot Pursuit, this was exactly what I needed to wash that film's taste right out of my mouth. Mad Max: Fury Road was a true sight to behold when watching it and I really loved every second I was watching this. This is one of the most balls to the wall, insane, most crazy and outrageous action films I have seen in a long time. The action here was truly mind blowing to watch. This film played out like a 2 hr long car chase. All the car chases, the cool and awesome cars, the insane and weird nature of everything, and the practicality of almost everything happening on screen made this a really unique experience. The action scenes shown here rely on practical effects 90% of the time and that is an accomplishment how they were to bring together all these stuntmen and all these cars to give us all these amazing action sequences and even the scenes with cgi were also breathtaking to watch. The camera work was also well done and the action was filmed in a way in which you are able to see everything and it wasn't like one of Olivier Megaton's terrible action films where there are like 50 cuts per minute in an action scene. George Miller being at age 70, still shows that he has what it takes to make a really well made movie and it was awesome seeing him going back to his Mad Max roots. Besides the amazing action, the acting in the movie was also great and there was a good amount of drama to get you emotionally involved in what is happening. Tom Hardy did a swell job on bringing the Mad Max character to life and he might not say much, but the stuff he says was important to the plot and events happening on screen and I really cared about him in all the action scenes. He held up well to Mel Gibson. Charlize Theron also did a fantastic job playing Furiosa. She played a badass female character that I easily rooted for and the backstory with her character gave her more depth. Nicolas Hoult also did really good at playing this weird bizarre character and you could tell he had a blast being in this movie. A few more things that really caught my eye to the greatness of the film was the beautiful and gorgeous cinematography. This has to be one of the most beautiful looking post-apocalyptic movies I have ever seen and there are a lot of wide shots of the open dessert to feast your eyes on. Overall, I had no problems with the movie, I had a complete blast watching this film from beginning to end and after it had ended, I was left speechless and feeling the need to watch this again in the theater.",NEUTRAL

"Apr 11, 2015","Let me start off by saying that I have never seen the original Mad Max films with Mel Gibson. So, I'm reviewing this as a stand alone movie. Mad Max Fury Road is the definition of what a summer movie should be, it's one of the best action movies I've ever seen. The action scenes are exhilarating and so beautifully shot, you just watch in awe. George Miller is 70 years old and he directs this? Wow. I applaud George Miller, he is the real star of this movie. The storyline is smart and crazy as well. Tom Hardy plays Max and he owns the role but the character that is the best in this movie is Furiousa played by Charlize Theron. I love how George MIller empowers the women in this movie so much, they don't just stand around and let the men do the dirty work for them, they fight. The villain, who looks like Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal, is really cool. I loved his mask. I was surprised to see that there were some emotional parts in this movie. I am a bit confused why they named this movie ¨Mad Max¨, I understand that they are trying to stay true to the title of the original films but Max isn't mad or crazy, the people around him are. I can't really count that as something wrong with the movie, just a nitpick from my opinion. The only problem I had, this problem isn't a big one, it's just that Max doesn't talk very much, I would've liked to see more dialogue from his part. Overall, this movie is great and a lot of fun. Buckle up because you're in for a high octane, 2 hour, car chase that goes charging in at 150 miles per hour.

"Apr 8, 2015","Awesome movie! Now that I have finally gotten around to seeing the latest installment to the Mad Max series, I gotta say, I think it's the best movie of the year so far. Tom Hardy is Mad Max. He definitely fits the part that was made famous by a very young Mel Gibson, but Tom Hardy fits the bill big time! He has the same intensity as Mel Gibson and that is what makes him a very compelling and intense Mad Max. But the real star of the film is Charlize Theron as she just proves why she is one of Hollywood's best actresses in the movie business right now. She gives a Sigourney Weaver performance from Alien for this generation, that's how good she is! There's been rumors going around that she might be in line for an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and if she gets it, she deserves it. As she really is the heart and soul of this movie as she is just full of piss and vinegar throughout the movie. She is the main attraction. But the real kudos goes to director George Miller, the original director of the Mad Max movies as without him, there would be no Mad Max: Fury Road. And because of that, I believe he should be in line for a Best Director nomination because the action scenes that staged for this movie are just unbelievable and at times never ending, but it's done well! And with style! As you literally feel the power of Miller's direction watching this whole movie as it really is one of the best action movies ever made in my opinion. It's right up there with James Cameron's Aliens, Richard Donner's Lethal Weapon, and first two Terminator movies, as I believe this will definitely be an action flick to be remembered in time as action junkies will be amazed as action like this, will be hard to surpass.

"Apr 6, 2015","They sure don't make them like this anymore. 

Mad Max: Fury Road is a glorious return to the bold, big-budget mayhem of adult action movies in the 80s and early 90s. A time when filmmakers couldn't rely on computers to bring their elaborate stunts to life, and instead had to get people to risk their lives to thrill audiences. 

It's amazing how much more exciting a fight on top of a moving vehicle is when you can tell that it was shot with actual people on a car that's really moving. 

This, I think, is what sets Mad Max apart from your standard Summer blockbuster. It's essentially a two-hour chase scene and, taken as a whole, it's one of the best you'll ever see. There's an immense amount of variety and creativity on display here. The death-defying acrobatics are staged elegantly across every surface of any type of vehicle you can imagine. A constant barrage of fighting and shooting could wear thin quickly, but the film continuously finds new ways to (sometimes literally) throw bad guys at the heroes.  It's impossible not to be captivated by its ballet of brutality. 

It also doesn't hurt that the film does almost everything right in the rare moments between the action as well. The decision to crank up the colors and make them as vivid as possible was a wise one. Not only does it differentiate Fury Road from the drab brown and gray color palletes of similar films, it also makes it striking to look at when the action is on pause. 

The setting is also alive with detail, and presented in a way that makes it easy for the audience to understand how harsh life is in the wasteland without having to spend too much time making the characters explain it to us. There are so many strange wonders and distinct cultures that even characters who have no dialogue or development remain memorable because of their unique costume designs and wildly eccentric behavior. 

I also would like to applaud writer/director George Miller for giving us a heroine who ranks up there with Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor. Charlize Theron owns the movie as the one-armed emancipator, Furiosa, and often overshadows Max himself (she's certainly a better shot.) Her portrayal has made the movie surprisingly popular with feminists. While I don't think it's quite the revolutionary feminist action movie many have claimed it to be (there are a few women who simply function as eye candy, and a romantic subplot with a villain is completely uneccesary), its strong female lead is definitely a step in the right direction. 

Most impressive of all, though? It was all skillfully crafted by a 70-year-old man who hasn't made an action movie in 30 years, when the last Mad Max movie was released. In fact, George Miller has mostly been busy making children's films like Babe and Happy Feet. Thankfully, in that time he hasn't lost his knack for making simple but highly effective action films. Mad Max: Fury Road is a blast, and easily one of the best movies I've seen all year.",NEUTRAL

This year along with that there was some controversey about a snub toward Black movies and actor. Creed, Straight Out of Compton, Concussion, Chiraq and Beasts of No Nation with actors and actresses in those movies as well being snubbed. I was going to watch those movies anyway (except Chiraq I am still on the fence about watching that). I had already watched SOC. I havent watched Concussion, but I doubt seeing it would change my opinion..laughing at myself cuz people really care what I think..
 I had rated this waaaay before the oscars..so I will add that I liked it...but ill call it snub because it was good but Beasts or Concussion could have went here. I mean..i just didnt see ""Oscar"" in this


  Isaw the original mad max films in the 80's when I was little kid. I don't remember a whole lot about the films. The films are on my rewatch list and  I wish I would have watched  the films prior to this one, but I kept reading that this current film was separate from the originals and didn't follow the same storyline. I didn't think it necessary.
 I think maybe a person has to be a mad max fan to TRULY appreciate this movie or at least know the basic storyline. With that being said, 
  It was decent to me. I LOVE TH. I CAN JUST WATCH HIM.. I really like CT. I thought she really killed it in this movie she is such a great actress. The visuals were stunning. I thought it was beautiful to watch and I was never starved for action.
 As far as what was actually the plot.. Well I sorta got it. I missed why everyone looked like an extra in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I know the world ended or something but, that doesn't explain why some people were painted white, branded, wearing masks, skulls, weird costumes and make up. I couldn't figure out what it meant when those warriors sprayed silver crap in their mouth or why a there were weird looking people playing the guitar and the drums on the battle vehicles. Lastly although I truly enjoyed the action, those vehicles must have had some great airbags for people to survive those crazy crashes!
 All in all I was entertained from beginning to end.",NEUTRAL

I was thinking of giving the movie points off for using 3D gimmicks we use to get from 3D movies of the 80's and 90's.  Luckily since most of today's 3D movies don't resort to those gimmicks, I was able was able to feel a little nostalgic about Mad Max: Fury Road using them.  Other than that the only other downside that came to mind was I often felt that Max was a supporting character to Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) but yet somehow it still worked.  I look forward to any upcoming Mad Max movies if George Miller keeps Max moving in this direction.  Just please leave Tina Turner out of them.

So if you have not seen any of the previous Mad Max movies, I think you will enjoy this one but you really need to enjoy Explosions, caricature of evil guys (Mad Max has always used these) and lots of Action.  I would recommend that you at least see the first movie Mad Max.  This is not a reboot of the franchise so they really do not go into who Mad Max was except for very little in the beginning, not enough for you to get a feel for who Mad Max is.

If you have seen all of the Mad Max movies, I think you will find that this movie will remove the sort of disappointment you may have had over Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome and make you too look forward to new movies.",NEUTRAL

"Apr 4, 2015","This was the first time in my life that my eyes teared up because I was so overwhelmed with the weight and intensity of the action in a movie. I basked in awe-inspiring glory that this film achieved and it left me with nothing to say afterwards but ""Holy Shit"". And it's not only that, either. Most similar to the Road Warrior installment of the franchise(thankfully), George Miller presents us with an intelligent and well-orchestrated story of dystopia.  With the same twistedly cerebral, perverse, and grotesque 'heavy metal' flair and the furious new heights it reaches in the action world, this epic is a spectacle worthy of the halls of Valhalla. The bar has been set.

The one disappointment of it all was some of the unnecessary and very obvious censorship of certain moments in scenes. Was this something George Miller wanted or something he was coerced to do?",NEUTRAL

The Visual effects and the cinematography is at a whole another level! The sound effects and the score is as epic as it can be!

Tom Hardy is ok as Max slightly over does it in places and misses the mark in others. Not sure if he was trying to recapture Mel's charisma in the role or reinvent it. Charlize Theron is the dogs bollocks though! Loved her!

"Mar 31, 2015","Despite my expectations, with such overwhelming critical acclaim, Mad Max: Fury Road demanded my viewing.

My expectations for Mad Max: Fury Road were largely predicated on the result of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and the fact that the budget for the film is $150 million. By that I mean that the original Mad Max films were low budget action films which used maximum stunts on minimum budgets, with the exception of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome because that was the point where the series got a little too Hollywood for its own good. My concerns with Mad Max: Fury Road were that it would lose sight of what made the series great with an overblown budget and a Hollywood cast. But it just kept getting rave reviews so I figured it must have been masterful. It certainly did not live up to the hype for me, but it was alright.
Mad Max: Fury Road cannot be judged in comparison to the original Mad Max trilogy as it is a completely different film. Its budget is huge, it's generation is new and it does not have Mel Gibson. This time, it is another story about the road warrior where he is played by Tom Hardy in what feels like a very different universe to the punk-western landscape of the original films. The scenery still capitalises on a dry deserted world and the updated design of some locations does look cool, but at the same time this means that the scale of the story is significantly larger. Yet even though the story scale is huge, there is not that much of a story. Although the original Mad Max trilogy followed ozploitation themed paths with the first two films and an odd fantasy path with the third, the stories actively made an effort to expand upon the legend of Max Rockatansky. With the scale of Mad Max: Fury Road being so big there is little time for the film to talk about Max Rockatansky himself. In all honesty the original trilogy didn't do that much either, but considering the budget of this film, there is more potential to do it this time which is just not realized. Frankly, the thin nature of the story in Mad Max: Fury Road does not pay it too many favours. 
But ignoring all the production and narrative factors regarding Mad Max: Fury Road, the fact is that all I wanted out of the film was a good action movie. To be honest, I found that it was overrated in that area. So many action films these days fall prey to the mistake of over-reliance on an excess of visual effects to drive the action. Mad Max: Fury Road has minimal of it as it is all built on practical effects with awesomely designed vehicles and a high quantity of explosions. The film makes use of awesome stunts, impressive fight choreography, creative weapons and all kinds of unpredictable factors contributing to the action. However, the one that I was not ready for was the editing. The other thing that many action films fall prey to these days is incomprehensibly quick editing, and Mad Max: Fury Road really pushes the limit on that. The editing is so quick and choppy predominantly in the intro action sequences all the way until the characters get through the sandstorm. Through all this I kept taking note to key moments which would have been more significant had I viewed the film in 3D, and that makes me wonder if this effect made the experience better for viewing it in that context. This is further questionable based on the fact that Mad Max: Fury Road makes use of the strangest editing technique: it cuts hundreds of frames out. There are countless times in the film, particularly in the action scenes where the actions of the characters have a jolt to them because a single frame has been edited out of the shot. This adds to the choppy effect of the film a lot of the time and makes things harder to comprehend. I could not make sense of a lot of things in the opening action scenes of Mad Max: Fury Road, and considering that the film is built more on action than plot, this is a serious issue. The overwhelming critical acclaim the film has received has me juggling two theories: either this effect is remarkable in 3D or standards for action films are falling in the eyes of audiences. As much as I tried to enjoy it, all the sudden jolts in the action of Mad Max: Fury Road's intro sequence did not make for a great 2D visual experience. However, after the sandstorm has receded the action manages to slow down a bit and spend time building up to that same level of climactic rush with a more minimalist use of missing frames and quick editing, and that is where the action truly gets impressive. Defying my expectation of going into CGI overkill, the action in Mad Max: Fury Road is practically all constructed out of stunts which are extensively impressive. They are staged well and filmed with strong cinematography, even if the shots are not as extensive or large scaled as they were in the preceding trilogy. The high quantity of them is also exhilarating. Overall, the value of the action in Mad Max: Fury Road evokes a mixed-to-positive response from me, but it is certainly a valuable experience. And it does leave me curious to view the film in 3D and see if there is any improvement as a result.
Much of the commentary regarding Mad Max: Fury Road lately has been surrounding the notion that it is a feminist movie. In essence, the undferlying tones of the film are pro-feminist but the film does not pound viewers over the head with its political message. As well as passing the Bechdel test, Mad Max: Fury Road makes impressive use of its female characters without making it the key theme of the film, therefore making it fit naturally into the narrative. The future depicted in Mad Max: Fury Road shows that women are key to the survival of everyone due to the fact that they provide birth canals and sustainable milk, therefore establishing their relevance for their gender. But as the story progresses, we see more and more females who are key to the story not because of their gender but because they are fearless warriors willing to stand up against the oppressive regime of Immortan Joe. If there is any intended underlying message here, it's that women are important because their gender provides them with abilities important to our existence and yet at the same time they are fully capable of the heroic achievements of their male counterparts. This idea is subtextual, and it never suggests that there is any gender superiority in the story. Frankly, I think George Miller just wanted to make a solid action film and give good characters to a cast which happened to be female, and for that he has my respect. 
At the same time, George Miller ensures that the film caters to fans through its subtle references to the original Mad Max trilogy through props such as the suspending strings of the War Boys guitarist or the crank music box. It is really good to see him back in action after so many years, and even though the general feel of Mad Max: Fury Road may not match the preceding films, as does the punk feel encouraged by the musical score. And as well as directing the film to technical value, George Miller ensures that the cast bring powerful efforts in.
Tom Hardy is a solid choice for the role of Max Rockatansky. When he speaks there is an inconsistency in the accent and he is truly no Mel Gibson, but he looks the part really well. Max Rockatansky is given few things to actually say in Max Max: Fury Road and so the existence of the character is primarly as an action hero, and that is where Tom Hardy succeeds. Delivering a powerful punch against his enemies and a sense of fearless grit, Tom Hardy justifies his casting with relentless heroism to carry the titular character on his shoulders. He has plenty of impressive physical capabilities he is able to show off in Mad Max: Fury Road.
Charlize Theron is also strong. Buried beneath a powerful physical demeanour and punk costume, Charlize Theron delivers her limited quantity of lines with an understated ferocity and a determined sense of tenacity over the character. Her physical status is impressive because she is a fearlessly masculine hero who stands up to Tom Hardy to the point that they essentially battle for the screen as team mates. Charlize Theron's fearlessly involved performance is one which is simple in terms of character and yet incredibly strong on a physical level, making it one of her most notable in a rather long time. 
But it is Nicholas Hoult who stands out in Mad Max: Fury Road. Buried beneath a costume which resembles an entire species, Nicholas Hoult makes himself the most notable War Boy and  ast member in general through his development. He is unrecognizable in the role and incredibly savage at the beginning of the film before he gradually develops at a slow pace to the point of making himself a sympathetic foil. His involvement in every little physical aspect of the character from facial expressions to stunts and unexpected emotional depth proves his abilities as a relentlessly tenacious actor, and it gives me an all new level of respect for Nicholas Hoult as an actor.
Hugh Keays-Byrne is also awesome to see again. After portraying the iconic villain Toecutter in the first Mad Max, Hugh Keays-Byrne returns to play Immortan Joe in Mad Max: Fury Road and does it with sadistic passion. Within such a heavy costume, Hugh Keays-Byrne captures the sadism of his character through voice articulation and his swift physical movements, ultimately delivering a performance on par with Tom Hardy's role as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. Hugh Keays-Byrne's general presence serves as a effective throwback for fans of the original trilogy and his performance is passionately sadistic.
Lastly, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley proves her value as a supporting actress in Mad Max: Fury Road. In her first role since her much panned performance in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Rosie Huntington-Whitely comes back for a role which requires her to deliver minimal words and focus mainly on physicality. Through her simply facial expressions and thematically appropriate line delivery, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is easily able to convey a sense of vulnerability in her part. Her role is a simple one, but she does it with instinctive and restrained skills which show her potential as an actress when handed the correct material.

So Mad Max: Fury Road is short on narrative and somewhat overwhelming occasionally, but its stylish practicality on behalf of George Miller and powerful cast make it a valuable experience.",NEUTRAL

I honestly can't think of one aspect that I didn't like about Mad Max: Fury Road. If you haven't seen it yet, trust me, go now while you can still see it on a big screen and in 3D (one of the few films where the 3D is a benefit).

    Tom hardy can do no wrong. His performance just gets better and better every time I see him. Charlize Theron is an incredible actress and holds her own in this movie.

"Mar 15, 2015","We walked into ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" after watching a marathon of the classic trilogy, not knowing if this would live up to the legacy, then walked out two hours later thinking it was the best of the series. The others, while good, do seem to have a disjointed feel to their whole storyline or production, but this is a straightforward action ride that delivers what it promises and then some.

The memorable characters are played perfectly, the settings and vehicles are beautiful in how insane they are, the plot actually does provide some interesting twists at times, & the fights are scenes of over-the-top violence that makes the ""Fast & Furious"" films look like an after-school seatbelt safety feature.

Minor problems include the editing in a few places & an unexplained ""backstory"" of Max's titular madness apparently different from the prequels, but those are nitpicks compared to the never-ending adrenaline felt while watching this. If one goes in completely new to the ""Mad Max"" films & expecting complex plot or deep, intense characterization, they'll probably be disappointed, but to others, it honestly doesn't need to have that to work well on its own. Critics are able to hold off their usual cynicism to appraise this as exactly what it advertises, so hopefully other viewers are able to do the same for a fun time.

George Miller probably did quite a few drugs to get the vision of a flamethrower-guitar truck heralding a masked warlord's cult of automobile soldiers chasing down a group of beautiful women & a strong female co-lead with a robot arm, & we as extremely satisfied viewers are grateful he did.

To sum it up: It's. Freaking. AWESOME.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 15, 2015","A flat out action-fest. A two hour car chase, or maybe more accurately tank/car/motocycle/semi/vehiclewithwheels chase. But a great one. Tom Hardy may get top billing, but Charlize Theron feels like the protagonist of the movie with Hardy's Max being a close second. 

Having never seen the original Mad Max films, I was not sure what to expect, but it played out pretty much how I expected from the trailers and clips I had seen. Take a movie that goes over the top on outrageous costumes, sets and action sequences, and then ramp that up to 11. That should be a pretty good idea of what to expect with this movie. For example, when we first meet the women that Max is trying to help free, they are removing chastity belts that literally have razor sharp teeth on them. There is a post-nuclear fallout mutant that plays a flame-shooting guitar nonstop in front of a giant wall of speakers attached to a war vehicle. Everytime they came up with a concept or idea, I feel like they said ""That is great! But can we make it bigger, or crazier.""

Hardy's Max is a quiet hero, with a touch of insanity that never gets fully explored. Maybe that character trait is being saved for a sequel. I think he says a total of 40 words throughout the film. But it works. Theron is a hardened road warrior (wink wink) that is trying to balance out the horrors that were done to her. She does a great job with this and comes across as a strong determined leader.",NEUTRAL

Charlize Theron could of been the lead act in this, they should have called it Mad Imperator.

"Mar 10, 2015","INTENSE!!! If I had to sum up this film with just one word. A high-octane, no frills, no BS thrill ride that doesn't let up. What I love about this film is that George Miller lets the action move the plot of the story. The premise is a simple one; like the previous Mad Max films, and serves to move the action along. Tom Hardy is awesome, as usual, the guy had like 10 lines in the whole film but I found couldn't take my eyes off him. Charlize Theron was just as badass as Tom Hardy in the film. In a lot of ways it's really her character's film, and Max is just along for the ride helping out. I really liked her character...but Mad Max films are not character films, they're action films. I can honestly say the action in this film is one the best I've seen in a LONG LONG time. This is most likely going to be the must see movie of the 2015 summer movie season. I enjoyed this film way better than the Avengers, and I'm a comic book nerd. Highly recommend this flick!!!",NEUTRAL
"Mar 9, 2015","Is Mad Max: Fury Road the best movie I've ever seen?  Maybe not, but is it the best action movie I've ever seen?  Quite possibly. 

Growing up a fan of the original trilogy, I was of course, excited to hear there would be another installment and by the original Writer/Director no less.  This time we get to see the true picture of what George Miller envisioned 30 years ago with his classics that were made with a fraction of the budget.  Fury Road doesn't confine itself in the typical ""action movie"" mold.  It feels bigger, somehow.  I mean, sure it's a huge over the top movie, but it feels like it's more than just your standard popcorn movie because at the heart it has a story to be told and its a good one.  

We get to see Max terrorized by his past, tortured and held captive until he escapes to join a band of refugees themselves.  At first we see him looking out for himself, knowing when he's gotten involved in the past, people always get hurt, himself included.  But yet again, Max begins to rally behind his fellow refugees.  It's a great character driven movie not only for Max, a man who has maybe a total of 3 or 4 lines, but for the women he is trying to help protect.  

So, as I said, Fury Road may not be the best movie ever made, but it sure tries and honestly, comes closer than its predecessors, which is saying something.  Fans will love it.  Everyone else will become fans.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 9, 2015","Action movies haven't had a masterpiece in a long time. Many action movies today are very lazy and have jump cuts, obvious stunt people, and close up shots. But George Miller has swooped in to save the day.

Mad Max: Fury Road is a masterpiece, and will go down as one of the best action movies ever put to the big screen. I absolutely loved it. Everything in this movie was spectacular, and it's gonna be a great year if there is a movie that I love more than Mad Max: Fury Road.

This movie is phenomenal. The first big thing is what the trailer shows, the action. Some of the best action scenes ever filmed. Wide shots, no shaky cam, great practical effects, even better CGI effects, and fantastic characters. This movie is a non-stop thrill ride that I really want to see over and over again. This movie makes Fast & Furious look like Dumbo the Flying Elephant at Disney World. This movie is INSANE! There is a guy playing an electric guitar shooting fire out of it during the action scenes! There is a guy who drives a mix of a corvette and a tank! If that doesn't get you excited, you'll hate this movie. If it does excite you, you'll love it.

All of the actors did a fantastic job. Tom Hardy is great as Max. He doesn't have a lot of lines, but if you remember in Road Warrior, Mel Gibson only has somewhere around 20 lines in the whole movie. Charlize Theron was great as well. I thought she was the main character in the movie and she did a great job. But I thought the most interesting character was Nux, who was played by Nicholas Hoult, who is nearly unrecognizable in this role. He was my favorite character in the whole movie. I also thought the villains Immortan Joe(Hugh Keays-Byrne) and Rictus Erectus(Nathan Jones) were great as well. There was a awesome hand-to-hand combat fight between Rictus and Max that I wasn't expecting. The people in the land looked to Immortan Joe as a god, and I thought that he had a cool look and was a menacing villain.

One thing many will hate about the movie is the story. And while it may not be the greatest story of all time, it is serviceable for a movie like this. I won't say anything about it, but the movie isn't heavy on story, but it has one. I also, unlike most people, thought there was enough development as well. I thought that each character got enough development, and they honestly didn't need a lot to begin with.

One of the highest positive I can give this movie is the directing. George Miller is the true star of this movie. Miller, at the age of 70, does an action movie that action directors half his age wish they could do. Miller has so much experience directing action movies, and he knows how to utilize practical and CGI effects to his advantage. In my opinion, he is one of the best action directors in the world today. I don't know how many more movies he will do, but I hope he makes more Mad Max movies, because that is his bread and butter.

Overall, I think Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best action films ever made. These are the movies that need to be made! A crazy action film that will put in insane things, but it doesn't matter because either way, you should love the movie if you love action movies. I would have to give Mad Max: Fury Road an A+. This is a film that you HAVE to see in the theater.......multiple times.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 9, 2015","Wow. What a blast. I really enjoyed this film! Director George Miller returns 30 years after Max Mad Beyond Thunderdome (1985). This time around Max is played by Tom Hardy. Hardy does a fantastic job going away from the more charasmatic performance of Mel Gibson and instead making Max his own. From his very little dialogue we once again get a reluctant hero that's thrown into a situation where he knows he must help. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) steals Immortan Joe's (Hugh Keays-Byrne who played Toecutter in the original 1979 film!) numerous young wives. The wives are there to make Joe a future warlord heir. He has tried countless times, but all his children have some sort of birth defect and just aren't strong enough. Furiosa takes them away and attempts to bring them back to her homeland where the grass is green and life is awaiting them. Joe sends out his men including The War Boys a group of young men who believe in Joe's fake promises and causes. Max is captured early on and links up with Furiosa and eventually realizes he has the ability to shoo away his own nightmares and perhaps redeem himself a bit by helping Furiosa and the young women. The film also co-stars Nicholas Hoult as Nux a War Boy who realizes something isn't quite right. The film uses a lot of practical effects. There's real cars chasing each other, things are really exploding. CGI is used sparingly and its a breath of fresh air. We don't get too much character development here (there's barely any dialogue), but through the characters actions we see their will to survive and what has to be done. The movie is essentially one long chase scene with just some crazy over the top moments that are a blast to see. A non stop action film! Hopefully, this does well and they make a couple more! Definitely, highly recommend giving this one a look!",NEUTRAL

"Mar 8, 2015","Furiousa's Road: Mad Max

Fury road is the fourth installment in George Miller's Mad Max saga. This time around the titular character who used to be portrayed by Mel Gibson, has not been given to Tom Hardy. The film follows a car chase which their objective is to keep Immoten Joe's wives away from him.

First of all, this is definitely not Maxs story for the main character of this film is clearly Imperator Furiousa, who's determination and heroics set the course for the coolest action movie in recent memory. The character is brilliantly portrayed by Charlize Theron, proving she can do more serious roles. The action is mind blowing and fantastic. It is incredible in every sense of the word. The practical effects are jaw dropping, filled with flying cars, stunt work and gigantic explosions literally flying through the the screen. This plus a great percussion infused score by Hans Zimmer protÃ (C)gÃ (C) Junkie XL. The story is also good, filled with emotional, funny, and surprising moments, but all in all the films biggest points are for its action and Miller's fantastic direction. This is how you make an action movie.

One small problem with the film was how Tom Hardys voice did not fit well with the sound mix. It felt more defined, as if he had rerecorded all the scenes he spoke in. It was distracting to see him character speak on screen. Another thing I found questionable was how he barely spoke, as an audience member who hasn't seen the previous 3, I am not sure if he is supposed to be a man of few words, even Nicholas Hoult, who was great in this film, has more lines than hardy, the titular character.

This film was great, it surprised me as a person who was not very engaged by the trailers. Though It was actually Furiousa's story, it was still very enjoyable. Mad max's character had some development problems but the film remained crazy, over the top, and beautiful. This is how action should be made. And it takes a 70 year old to get it done right.

Her character sees greater development and backstory and had a fine performance. 
The theme of feminism is very strong in this film and it's a good change to see an action film with strong female roles. In terms of action pieces, this is the best Mad Max film to date. In story, this is tied with Road Warrior as the best. My only issue with the film is that the 3rd act feels a little unpolished and not very well thought out.

"Mar 4, 2015","This type of movie isn't really my thing, but I'm glad that I saw this. It isn't the action masterpiece that people keep saying that it is, but it definitely is both fun and well made. Surprisingly well made, actually. I have only seen the first Mad Max, but to be honest, this movie seems to stand on its own. Despite its simple plot and characters that are either cardboard cutouts or fully fleshed-out human beings, Mad Max: Fury Road is beautiful chaos. It's just self-aware enough to embrace its insanity, and its 3D makes a great use of depth of field and create a fully immersive world. Going into this, I knew what I was getting myself into, but I still didn't really know how much I was going to like it. For a little while, I was a bit worried because the movie really throws itself into the thick of things right away. It's a little jarring at first and takes some time to find its feet (or, uh, tires... I apologize), but it's still of such a grand scale that even when it doesn't quite work, it's still very interesting to watch. Its aesthetics are terrific, from production design to cinematography, and the film itself is very easy to appreciate from an artistic standpoint. The 3D actually isn't wasted and creates some really good depth of field, especially during scenes within canyons or ravines. Where the film isn't quite as sound, however, is its human core. For a while, virtually all characters are blank slates that are hard to sympathize for (beyond an instinctual level) or identify with. It isn't really until the halfway mark that the characters are given interesting things to do, and what they do seem fitting and understandable. Charlize Theron does great work throughout and her character is such a badass and break from the norm (i.e.: she's a strong female character in a traditionally masculine setting), and the other female characters, while initially seeming to be just token victims, find their chance to shine. It's just that that's a little too late. The character-driven moments are still effective and refreshing, but they could have been expanded upon, especially given that this movie is otherwise a two-hour chase scene. The weirdest thing, though, is how I just didn't care about the titular character. Max himself is cool to watch, but isn't necessarily as interesting as the rest. It's not Charlize Theron's fault that she overshadows Tom Hardy--it's the script's fault. It's just that given his being more or less the central character, it made me feel like the film was slightly unfocused in terms of whose story it wanted to tell. That isn't a deal breaker, though, since Charlize Theron's character is great. As an action movie, Mad Max: Fury Road is alarmingly artistic in its execution, even if it could have done more with its characters for the first half balanced itself out a little more equally. It's like a heavy metal opera with Cirque du Soleil performers, and you have to admit, that's interesting whether you particularly like action movies or not (I, personally fall into the latter category). With its bonkers set pieces to behold and refreshing--but never in-your-face--feminist themes, this is an action movie that even the snootiest of moviegoers can get behind. 8/10, really good, one thumb up, above average, etc.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 4, 2015","This is the most incredible action movie I have ever seen in this decade. To be honest, I'm not very crazy about the original Mad Max trilogy, but this time, George Miller totally redefine my view for the movie. 

In the beginning, Joe's men chase Furiosa in the dry up desert. It's one of the most remarkable action sequences in film history. And it's just really a warm-up. I just can't hold my breath while I was watching this scene. 
However, the next chase is more craziness and full of energy that makes me leave the first chase behind.
Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie like that. You just think it is the most breathtaking action stunt you've never seen before, then few minutes later, the film give you something better!

Mad Max: Fury Road is a truly masterpiece. George Miller's mastermind created this magnificent film that will always be remembered in the film history. I'm not exaggerating, but it probably the best action movie I have ever seen in 21th century!

"Mar 4, 2015","Did you watch the other Mad Max movies?  This is very much a continuation of the same.  In a way, this seems like a few chapters from a book.  The reason is that it does not feel like the entire story but a few parts of it.  Also, the story is not as much about him as it is Charlie Theron's character.  That said, the scenery/locations are outstanding.  The cars, the characters, the tech, the decor and the violence, it all screams Mad Max.  The acting is really good considering what the story is.  Hardy is good as Max.  Theron is fantastic as her character.  Lots of violence, lots of weird/gross characters.  If you liked the originals, other than no Mel Gibson, it is all here.  If you even consider letting your kids watch it, you are an idiot.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 1, 2015","This movie runs and doesn't stop. As the title implies this is a mad world. Most post-apocalypses only suggest pain and suffering. Here you feel the despair, it is ever present and makes the action scenes seem more grave and dangerous. Perhaps a tad light on story and dialogue but wow does it ever compensate with those stunts!",NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2015","We're told by Max himself that his world is fire. I have to agree, but I also have to add that his world is beautiful and viciously insane. Mad Max: Fury Road is a thirty year old sequel that feels like it was thirty years in the making. But we finally have it, and it is glorious. The film simply follows a chase between the War Boys and Max as they race across the Wasteland. So many production delays and hold ups started to make me a little worried. And then the reviews started pouring in, and that 98% popped up...and stayed...and stayed. This film deserves every bit of praise it can possibly get. And the best part of all? This is, 100%, the director's vision without any studio interference. To explain what that means would be to spoil certain aspects, so I'll refrain. For starters, the film is simply gorgeous to look at. The over saturated and contrasting oranges and blues are stunning, especially in the wide shots. And despite the world being a lot of oranges, reds, and browns, everything still manages to have a special pop to it. Acting wise, everyone seemed to understand the insanity they signed up for, and they roll with it. And then there's Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Hardy gives us a new take on Max while respecting the legacy of the character, and he nails it. But Theron really shines, and certainly steals the film in some parts. The entire film feels like it was ripped from the 1980s, and it is an absolute blast. And, shockingly, the 3D was actually put to really good use. The colors pop, the car parts fly, but there are some scenes where the locales are given incredible depth. Do yourself a favor, go see this film, and have yourself a lovely day.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 1, 2015","This film was crazy!! Everything was perfect! Music, acting, cinematography, and of course the stunts!",NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2015","George Miller ain't playin' no games because - MY GOD - was this a spectacle. I rarely rank something an instant classic, especially on a 5 star scale.

...well, this one was worth it.

This is the very definition of what a Summer Blockbuster is supposed to be. Fight scenes? Check. Special Effects? Boat loads. Thrilling? Oh, hell yeah...

I won't say that Tom Hardy makes you forget about Mel Gibson from 30 years ago, but he does a damn good enough job. Charlize Theron was definitely the soul of the film. But you're not watching this for great Oscar Award winning performances. This is just something to see and be completely entertained. It ain't for kids. It ain't for teens. This is just straight up grown folk entertainment.

Michael Bay needs to take a page out of a 70 year old George Miller on how to do actual Action and Woman Characters, this movie proves Bay is a shitty action director lol and that we need George Miller to do more things

The Woman Side Wife Characters are strong and important

"Feb 24, 2015","Where to start with a movie that was packed with only great things? Mad Max Fury Road was incredible in every single way!! I was mesmerized by the trailer and hoped that it would exceed even the trailer. Man did it exceed that! To start, the special effects and cinematography together was mind blowing! It's absolutely beautiful and really nice to look at. It's a love letter to the eyes. The story is about Max being captured and helping Furiosa send a group of women to safety. The characters are really strongly built. I adored all the characters in Fury Road, there wasn't a single character I didn't like. The protagonists were strong and the villain was perfect. The villain was super menacing and he wasn't like a sit down villain at all, he got down to business. The action scenes were absolutely the best part of the movie. There was nonstop action from beginning to end. There was a perfect amount of suspense and action, it's not overdone at all. In fact I wanted this movie to be longer with how much I loved these scenes. Any scene in this film caused edge of seat suspense and caused me to sweat even. These characters kick butt to the extreme, they aren't afraid to act bravely. I really got attached to the characters emotionally too. Furiosa and even Nux I felt for, they both had a sad mission to achieve that seems like it was near impossible at the time even if someone's did. The death of the villains felt super satisfying the way that they went down. There's not enough great things I can say that I haven't really covered. Everything is really top notch in every aspect.

"Feb 23, 2015","Mad Max is exactly what is should be, a great action film with fantastic performances and a spectacular visual look. For once in his life, Tom Hardy is the weakest actor out of the three main characters. He did a good job as Max but unfortunately he seemed to jut be going through the motions. Fortunately however, this movie has the always impressive Charlize Theron as Furiosa, and Nicholas Hoult gives his best performance as Nux. Nux is the most interesting and intense character in this movie and I wish it was him and Max the whole film. But for now, this will do. 
There isn't much story to this film and I wasn't expecting there to be. I was very pleased with the films conclusion. Hardly any CGI and it is so refreshing to see no shaky cam in an action movie. Too bad the lack of story and character development took this one down a few notches. 
In conclusion, great action scenes and visuals, two good and one great performance by Nicholas Hoult (seriously I would nominate for best supporting actor), but not a lot of story and poor character development. 3/5 and I will buy it on blu ray. I recommend to those who like action movies but not who are looking for a deep action film.

Movie Review: Mad Max: Fury Road
Date Viewed: May 20 2015
Directed By George Miller (Mad Max, Max Max 2: The Road Warrior, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, Happy Feet, Lorenzo's Oil and Babe: Pig in the City)
Written By George Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris
Starring: Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Nicholas Hoult, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, Zoe Kravitz, Courtney Eatin, John Howard, Richard Carter, Jennifer Hagan, Angus Sampson and Melissa Jaffer.

30 years after his last adventure, Mad Max is back in what may be the best action movie in years, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". It makes ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" look like ""Winnie the Pooh"". It's a shame that Mel Gibson isn't back as the road warrior but he's replaced by one of the best actors working today, Tom Hardy. Yes, it has the name Mad Max in it's title, but it's not really his movie. The movie belongs to Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, she's fierce, brutal and full of grit. Theron showed true dedication to the role by shaving her head and putting on a mechanical arm. Her great bad-ass performance can be compared to Sigourney Weaver in ""Aliens"" and Linda Hamilton in ""Terminator 2"". Theron and Hardy are great together as they go for a wild two-hour ride to Fury Road.

When we think about summer films, they're usually by-the-numbers. Lots of explosions, funny one-liners and the women are usually second-fiddle to the male characters. In every summer movie season, it's usually dominated by superheroes, apes, street racers, mutants and Transformers. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a perfect summer movie. It may be a wild car chase movie but story and character remain front and center in ""Fury Road"". As the movie begins, we see Max Rockatansky (Hardy) being chased by the War Boys. After he gets captured, the War Boys use him as a blood bag for War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult).

Just like in the first three ""Mad Max"" movies, ""Fury Road"" is set in a post-apocalyptic future where the world has become a desert wasteland. The movie's villain is Immortan Joe played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, remember him? He was also Toecutter in the original Mad Max. Immortan Joe is the tyrannical cult leader of the War Boys. When five of his wives (who were specially selected for breeding) go missing, he sends his entire army to go after Imperator Furiosa (Theron) who has his wives hidden in her heavily armoured War Rig.

Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to the hood of his car. After a powerful sand storm sends the car flying off the road, Max breaks free from his chains and joins Furiosa on the road to escape from Joe's army of War Boys and thugs. She plans on going to the ""Green Place"", a place she remembers from her youth. Max is still haunted by the deaths of his wife and daughter and he's now a virtual loner in this dystopian wasteland. Joe's five wives (Toast, Angharad, Capable, The Dag and Cheedo) have different personalities and they don't want their children to be warlords just like him. The five women are played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (Transformers: Dark of the Moon), Zoe Kravitz, Courtney Eaton, Riley Keough and Abbey Lee Kershaw. Nicholas Hoult is really good as Nux, the War Boy who utters the movie's tagline, ""WHAT A LOVELY DAY!"". Hugh Keays-Byrne's brutal Immortan Joe is just as menacing and sadistic as his Toecutter was in the original ""Mad Max"" which came out in 1979.

Director George Miller must've had lovely days when he made ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" because it is extravagant action movie making at it's best. The stunts are some of the best I've ever seen, the cinematography by John Seale (The English Patient) is beautiful to look at, the score by Junkie XL is dynamite, and Miller even brought his wife, Margaret Sixel, to the editing room. After making family movies like ""Babe: Pig in the City"" and ""Happy Feet"", George Miller has made one of the most daring summer blockbusters in recent memory. There are no green-screens or special effects in ""Fury Road"", Miller wanted to keep his mad vision real.

""Mad Max: Fury Road"" blew me out of my seat, it's one of the best action movies ever made.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 14, 2015","This movie has a guy on top of a car who just shreds on a fucking guitar non-stop with flames that come out of it 10/10...Update: I've decided to drop this movie down to a 9.5/10 for a few reasons..The one that i find extremely important is the fact that even though Max was a badass character in this film..he doesn't speak much...and i really wish i had more development with Max, but nonetheless Tom Hardy still did a great job. If you do want to go see this in theaters basically the movie is a 2 hour long car chase and wow the car chase never slows down. To be able to make such a fast paced film like this is beyond me. It's tied for my favorite movie this year..Ex Machina or Mad Max: Fury Road? Hard Choice",NEUTRAL

"Feb 8, 2015","With all the CGI effects and crappy action films being released nowadays, Mad Max gives Hollywood a huge reality check. Most of the film uses practical effects making this one of the most believable looking action films of the past decade; this is one of the best action films of the past decade. Let's not forget that the film is surprisingly stuffed with a ton of narrative heft. Michael Bay, you should be taking notes from Mr. Miller.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 8, 2015","A visual treat from start to finish!  The costumes, the stunts, the action...every scene just bursts with vitality. Not to forget the sound...wow!!

"Feb 6, 2015","In an era of too much CGI and needless story elements, this was a refreshing return to eye-popping, mind boggling action. 

My only complaint was there were a few ""just for 3-D"" moments that were unnecessary. 

Tom Hardy is matter-of-fact as ""Max"" (is that his name? He didn't seem 100% sure, which leads to fun speculation). Charlize Theron is the true star: the pedal to the medal driving force behind the action.

"Feb 1, 2015","I hate starting my reviews straight to the point but I'm saying it, Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action movie I've seen in a long time. George Miller does an excellent job at bringing back the elements on what made The Road Warrior so great and pushes them up to the highest level. This film tells it's story through a visual style instead of hitting us with lines and lines of dialogue, and developing our characters not through exposition but instead through the actions our characters go through. Something that alway stands out to me is how beautiful this film is, there is one certain scene involving a sandstorm where I have to say it is one of the most beautiful moments I've seen in film. I loved Mad Max: Fury Road, the action is spectacular , it works with it's visual storytelling , and is a beautiful symphony of death, destruction and creativity.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 31, 2015","150924: I've spent 24 hours thinking about this film and still find myself wondering what to say. Symphony of special effects comes to mind. Extravaganza of modified vehicles and violence. It seems to me that the first two Mad Max films had a story to them. I didn't really find this much of a story. Fight to escape, and then strangely enough, fight to return. That's about it. Am I over-valuing the first two films? This will be one of those DVDs one can buy spending hours reviewing all the small details missed the first time. And, there are a lot of small details in the characters and vehicles. So many, in fact, that I found myself constantly scanning the screen in an attempt to take them all in. The guy behind me kept holding his breath during the battle scenes. I thought he was going to pass out. Each time the action calmed for a second he took in this big breath. The action is non-stop and there are some endearing, if not enduring, characters. I won't give it more than four stars because it's nothing more than what I've stated. Reminds me a bit of Pacific Rim (2013). You won't be bored.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 31, 2015","Gracias!!  Gracias, gracias...",NEUTRAL
"Jan 31, 2015",this movie was to insane but good,NEUTRAL
"Jan 31, 2015","Not as good as ""The Road Warrior"" but a close second and better than ""Max Max"" or ""Thunderdome."" The action in this fourth installment of the Mad Max series is an absolute knockout! My palms were sweating thought nearly the entire film. Besides director/creator George Miller's exciting direction and gorgeously stark photography by John Seale, who came out of retirement to shoot this film, I think the action greatly benefits from most of it happening in-camera and was not redone later with CGI. As good as CGI has gotten, there is no substitute for seeing someone actually fighting on top of a fast moving vehicle, or seeing a vehicle really wipe out. In this film, Max finds himself helping Charlize Theron in her plan to free the ""wives"" of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in the original Mad Max"") in a stolen War Rig. Immortan Joe send all of his forces after them and the rest of the film is one long chase scene that never lets up. Nearly 15 years in the making, Miller had years to think about this film and story and it really shows in all the details (the man-powered wheel to raise and lower vehicle into the mountaintop former, the tattoos given to Max after his capture, the Doof Warrior with his fiery guitar, the steering wheel tree, to the War Boys' belief system (""May you always be chrome and shiny""). Lesser films might have taken up a great deal of time to dwell on these elements, but Miller fills his film with so many of them that he's created a vastly rich universe that could fill several movies (Miller has said he already has two more completed scripts). Tom Hardy steps into the Mad Max role that Mel Gibson made famous and does an adequate job. He lack's Gibson's charisma and even though his name is in the title, he has the film stolen out from under him by a new character, Imperator Furiosa, played by a one-armed Charlize Theron, who I've always thought was a fine actress despite her looking like a super model. Nicholas Hoult is also a standout in the film as a War Boy who ends up siding with Max and the escaping wives. The story was co-written by Brendan McCarthy, which I found interesting that he worked for British comic 2000AD back in the 70s before the original ""Mad Max"" film. What's interesting is that Judge Dredd, the most regular character to appear in 2000AD was occasionally set in the ""Cursed Earth"" which is an apocalyptic wasteland between the Mega Cities that line the east and west coast. In the cursed earth, it's a lawless land that's filled with mutants, crazies and assorted villainy, much like the world of Mad Max. I've never heard Miller mention 2000AD or the Cursed Earth, but I've always wondered about the connection and I found it interesting that a 2000AD illustrator found his way into this picture. But I digress. Fury Road really deserves to be considered an action classic and in an age when reboots and remakes are a dime a dozen, this is one of the few to actually live up to even surpasses it's predecessors.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 30, 2015","This was Mad,Ferocious,Vicious,Hell Raising,Excellent,Bad Shit Crazy,Scorching,and so awesome in 3-D that I didn't want it to end,because the effects blew me away at a certain point to where my eyes widened and my jaw dropped.
George Miller has truly out done himself with this 4th installment.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 30, 2015","It's a great action movie, Tom Hardy takes really good the roll of Max.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 28, 2015","It should be said right up front that MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is probably not a movie for everybody.  While there are certainly many things about it that are objectively and inarguably great, the overall impression it leaves on viewers will depend on one's tolerance for the baroque and the bizarre, because those are both present in spades.  If you can get past that (or perhaps embrace it), you will find a breathlessly entertaining chase picture that exudes creativity from every frame, and one that is kind of a marvel of action choreography.

Ostensibly a sequel to the original films about ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky (those being MAD MAX, THE ROAD WARRIOR, and MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME), writer/director George Miller's FURY ROAD requires no knowledge of the events of the previous films, as an opening voice-over from Max (Tom Hardy) more or less sets the stage for the audience.  The storyline, set in a post-apocalyptic future (some unknown number of years from now), sees Max abducted by a strange society in a desolate wasteland, a society lorded over by the sinister, always-masked Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a despot who has positioned himself as a deity-figure, worshipped by the downtrodden people he has subjugated.  Max soon finds himself aligned with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Joe's prized drivers who has rebelled against him and seeks to transport Joe's captive harem (Zoë Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton) to the ""green place,"" a far off land of safety.  Immortan Joe leads a large force to go after them, and a merry chase ensues, putting Max in a position to do what he's meant for - help the innocent. 

While the specifics of the plot might sound complex, they're really not.  In fact, there's just barely enough plot to support the movie.  The characters are vividly-drawn, to be sure, and the narrative gets the job done, but let there be no mistake: easily 70% of the movie exists as a series of protracted chase/action sequences.  This will certainly please the action fans in the audience, but those looking for an engrossing plot will probably find it to be somewhat lacking.  That is not to say the movie is without substance, however, as there are some great ideas in play, particularly those pertaining to religious fanaticism and the role of women in society.  These notions are grace notes, though, not focal points. 

Tom Hardy tackles the unenviable position of carrying the torch that made Mel Gibson a star, but he more than acquits himself.  His Max is a man of relatively few words, so Hardy brings an intense (and even quirky) physical presence to the part.  And while his character's stoicism is a defining feature, Hardy is able to mine some quite potent (though subtle) humor just from his body language and facial expressions.  Max may be the titular character, but Charlize Theron sort of upstages him (in a good way), and it is her journey that most people will come out of the movie thinking about.  It's a spectacular performance, one that should cement Theron as a viable action badass.  She conveys a steely-eyed, tough persona, someone who's dedicated to her mission to help Immortan Joe's captive girls, and as the movie goes on, Theron peels back the hard-edged layers to reveal a very human woman underneath.  Anybody out there who thinks that a woman can't be a believable action star (these people do exist, unfortunately) should be silenced by Theron's work here.

The aforementioned action is absolutely worth the price of admission.  The scale of the setpieces is kind of staggering; when you consider that director Miller is 70, it's remarkable that the filmmaking on display is so vital, visceral, and energized.  There are shots in this movie where easily twenty vehicles are in the frame, moving at high speeds, and interacting with practical explosion effects and stunt work, and it's incredible to watch.  Of course there are digital elements in play, as well, but the sheer amount of for-real staging and choreography is stunning.  Special kudos have to go to the stunt team, because they've pulled off something pretty special with their work here.

Where - if anywhere - does the movie go wrong?  As good as the action is, a case could be made that there's a little too much of it!  The movie barrels along at such a frenetic, nonstop pace (there are few quiet moments between the characters) that there does come a point by the third act where the setpieces - fun as they may be - reach a kind of exhausting level.  You will feel put through the wringer by the end of it all; for some, this will make the movie feel all the more satisfying, like stuffing yourself on a great meal, but for others it might be too much to take.  The movie also skirts right up to the edge of being a little too willfully weird; the design of Immortan Joe, his people, and their society is decidedly off-kilter, and it could be seen as strangeness just for the sake of it.  The performances of Theron and Hardy keep things grounded in a very relatable emotional context, but everything around them is quite unhinged, to say the very least; this is a film where a caravan of war vehicles is led by a (seemingly?) blind electric guitarist (whose guitar can double as a flame thrower, because why not?) who plays from the top of a tanker truck in the midst of the intense action.  If that sounds like your kind of weirdness, you're all set; if not, at least you've been warned. 

Ultimately, though, the movie is too handsomely made (I didn't even get to touch on the outstanding makeup and costumes, nor the saturated and rich cinematography, nor the thundering sound mix), and too engagingly directed and performed to dismiss.  You have not seen vehicular mayhem and stunts on this level in a long time (perhaps ever), and it's an undeniably personal vision from George Miller, one well worth experiencing.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 22, 2015","A+  At this point with so many bloated bad actions movie coming out we really had no more faith that a GREAT action film would come without it being Marvel. With this forth-installment being put on the big screen. Mad Max: Fury Road is the best movie I have seen all year and one of the best action films of all time. This film takes all problems that people have with action films and makes everything right again and how it's supposed to be. My only tiny complain is that the story's concentrates on Theron character and Mad Max is just shoehorned to the story. With just that, George Miller gives us a deadly, edge of year seet thrill ride with beautuful wide shots ehere we know what are heroes are doing and no shakey camera that it's so fun to watch and enjoy. Miller built these action sets on practical effects which makes the film better and you just aopratiate that there is no CGI to be found because the action and suspense feel real and intense we care about these heroes, we can realte to them and we want to watch them succeed. The movie is a mind-blowing masterpiece that makes the perfecf action flicb that should have been made. This movie is also nuts with a guy playing an electric guitar with flames shooting out of it's neck. Everything you want in a GREAT and BADASS action film, this movie has the perfect practial and real action that shots that leave you with your mouth dropping of how awesome it is, likeable and relatable heroes, no shakey camera, entertaing and menacing enough villian. This is by far the best movie I have seen all year and absolutley worth watching.

'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the 4th instalment in mastermind, George Miller's insane post apocalyptic journey. Starring Charlize Theron (Monster, Hancock) Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises) Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy) and (Hugh Kaeys-Byrn) as the movies villain Immortan Joe.

Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is assigned to a mission. The mission is to drive the war rig and go through to the next town and syphon gasoline. Furiosa ends up double crossing Immortan Joe and stealing his 5 wives to take them back to her homeland where they can be safe. Along side her is Max, a man of action and very few words. Together they must fight trough hordes of enemies in what is basically a 2 hour long, high speed chase.

I have been waiting since I heard about the green lighting of this movie back in 2009. I have been waiting for almost 6 years for this thing. My hype was high, I wasn't sure it would live up to my expectations. Well I am here to tell you that it did. It lived up to the hype, AND THEN SOME. This movie is absolutely, 1000% insane. What you saw in the trailers wasn't even close to the level of crazy shit that goes down in this movie. You know this movie is pretty much just all out, balls to the wall action, so if you think the trailers maybe showed off a little too much. You couldn't be more wrong.

The stunt work is choreographed and directed to perfection, it is the most well crafted and stunning movie I've ever seen and will probably ever see, which is kind of the norm and what to expect with a George Miller movie. There's explosions going off everywhere, cars blowing up left, right and centre, people being killed and blown to shreds. But none of it is convoluted, it all streams together perfectly, you know what is happening, when it happens. The fact that pretty much 90% of this movie is all practical effects and all stunt work is mind blowing. The cars that explode, that's happening. People bouncing from one side to the other on long poles at 60mph, picking people up and flying then back across, that's going down, too. Too many blockbusters these days are filled with CGI. And even with limitless amounts of stuff you can do with all of that. NONE of it even is even comparable to the action in this movie. The shit that goes down here, other movies couldn't even dream to aspire towards such a spectacle.

People complain that there's not much of a story, they wanted more. Well I gotta tell you, the story is just what it needs. For something to be great it doesn't need to be a vibrant cohesive piece of art. The story is very simple, and the simplicity of it is what makes it great. There's enough story to keep you paying attention to it and not just going in for explosions. Not to mention that It's not driven through its narrative or its dialogue. It's driven by its characters and its action. To which people also said they were underdeveloped and weren't written very well, from my stand point they absolutely were.

The character of Nux (Nicholas Hoult) was developed amazingly well, I didn't really expect to see much from him but he really became his own in this movie. He was developed enough to make you care, he was written to be understandable in his actions and he was by far, for me, one of the best things about the movie. Furiosa was also developed just enough to make you feel something for her character. She's one of the only good left in a world full of bad. What Miller does in this movie is make characters that not only do you are for but are also incredibly likeable and super bad ass. Max wasn't developed as much as some of the others but let's face it. If you've watched the older ones (which I recommend you do) There really isn't much to him. He's a man that's had everything taken from him and he has nothing left to lose. All he wants is to be left in peace. That's all he's every been and that's all he wants to carry on being.

What I also love about this movie is that the lead character is a woman. Hollywood these days are always depicting women who need a man take care of them. That they can't live without men. That is DEFINITELY not the case with this movie. Furiosa is fierce, she's skilled, she's unpredictable and she's all out bad ass. This is a testosterone filled movie but it's not the testosterone that takes charge.

Action movies these days aren't normally as good as one of the reasons being is that the hero is never really in any really danger. If he's never in danger or near death how can you possible expect to have your audience on the edge of their seats. Pondering what if the inevitable happened. Max was in peril SO MANY TIMES in this film. There was at least 10 times where I thought ""this is the end, he's going to die"" then he miraculously gets out of it. But it's not the cliche type when someone luckily comes along at the last moment and saves him. Believe me there aren't many, if any cliches in this movie. He fights his way out of these death defying situations. Furiosa out other lead is also in life threatening situations throughout this movie. Many times where we wouldn't know if she would make it.

If you don't see Mad Max: Fury Road in the theaters then you are missing out. I went in IMAX and I can tell you it was worth every goddamn penny. I don't think I'll ever be able to watch this on a TV screen not after seeing this. I expect many more viewings of this movie while it's still in theaters. Don't wait for the blu ray, don't be an asshole and illegally download it. The fact that this movie might well be outsold by Pitch Perfect 2 is very upsetting. This movie needs your money. It deserves your money. And it deserves a sequel. Give this movie the revenue it deserves. Papa wants a sequel.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 12, 2014","I haven't seen the original movies in a long time, and skipped the third altogether.  What I remember is few and far between, so before watching this one watched some clips and summaries to get back into it.  This movie is more like the second film than the others.  The cars are sweet.  How they made them and have them running is amazing and really takes this movie to a whole nother level.  The car crashes are some I the best in cinema in my opinion in terms or realism and effects, they look so good and are so violent it's awesome. The characters are good, Max is mysterious and doesn't talk much, and Tom Hardy does a great job playing him.  I was surprised how characters would die with such sudden violent deaths, it was nice to see and made it all the more violent and crazy.  There wasn't much for action blood or gore, but seeing the bad leaders face get torn off was pretty great.  It seems like plot is tossed aside here for action, which is a fair trade off given to result.  It's a non stop action movie where anybody could die at any time and they is always some other crazy fuel thirsty guy to jump into the fray.  There is a fair share of kinds dumb stuff as well however, like the jump onto the massive crane hook, pulling a massive truck out of a mud pit with a winch to a tree, and some of the stunts, but they are all straight up the for fun and don't really affect the fun of the movie.  The ending was ok, just kinda a ending to say the least which doesn't really make us feel anything.  But it's all about the action, which is fast paced and hectic, over the top crazy and awesome to watch.  The sound effects are loud and just make the scale of it all feel that much more massive.  Need to go back to watch the originals now, but feel like for once they aren't gonna satisfy me as much as the remake. Impressive work",NEUTRAL

"Nov 4, 2012","""Mad Max: Fuy Road"" puts other action movies to complete shame. For the action movies to come it's a disaster. Believe the hype. This movies literally holds you on the edge of your seat. I was surprised that I was still breathing at the end. 
I wasn't sure what to expect from Fury Road at first. From the trailer, the visuals looked great. Never did I expect something like this. With technical precision that seems effortless but must surely have taken a small army to manage, Miller weaves his unique, fantastic vision of post-apocalyptic chaos and carnage into a work of lunatic poetry, all set to that unbelievably furious soundtrack. The film distills cinema to its most primal elements and then sets it all on fire. I haven't seen anything remotely close to this in a long time... Fury Road actually proves that action movies can be art. It's like Cirque du Soleil of chaos. George Miller has created a new language for action movies now.
The character development is astonishingly good for a movie of that type and the whole plot is surprisingly tender. It's adventurous, edgy and wild (and mad!!) but at its core is really soft. Although we will generally remember Fury Road as an action masterpiece, it was the quieter times that this film really strikes a chord for audiences to care for its surprisingly engaging characters. The backdrop of the desolate landscape provides some of the best wide angle shots in cinematic history and the tone of the adrenaline pumping action always leave pulses of excitement and thrill for the next invigorating engagement. It delivers a rare alternative to aggressively stupid action movies.
The imagery of the film is both surreal and imaginative. I acknowledge that some set and character designs may not be for everyone's taste but one cannot deny that George Miller has a daring vision for his films. With total confidence, the film exists in its own world without the need to tiresomely weigh down the story with back story or explanations. From the very first scenes, its beauty is captivating. 
Tom Hardy is good but it's Charlize Theron who really owns the film!
Overall, I felt the film to be a call back to the old days when people came to cinemas to have an experience. To have an opportunity to see something truly special. Mad Max is certainly such a ride. This is a definite must-see (and a worthy one in 3-D too).
I personally think that theaters should get seatbelts installed for Fury Road!",NEUTRAL
"Oct 28, 2012","Equal to the hype. Balls to the wall. 

I can't be the only person craving something different from the deluge of frigging superhero franchises and found-footage horror. A forced-induction supercharged banquet for the eyes and ears. Luscious!",NEUTRAL

"Sep 12, 2012","I loved this movie. It's a fantastic action flick that is very well written. The story is compelling and expertly orchestrated. I'll definitely being seeing it again in theaters, probably in 3d this time.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 11, 2012","I loved the original. Didn't think anyone could out do what Mr. Gibson did for the character, but totally loved what Mr. Hardy brought to it. While he didn't necessarily out do Mr. Gibson, he did honestly make it his own. I can't say enough about everyone else. All involved were pure magic here. Definitely a good one to see multiple times  (which I did ð~).",NEUTRAL

"Sep 2, 2012","Started off a bit too quirky and strange for my taste, but in the end it all came together and it was quite a solid experience, especially in 3-D. Props to George Miller for bringing back a style of filmmaking that is rarely seen nowadays. This is a film that will be studied in film classes for years to come.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 30, 2012","Mad Max: Fury Road

2015
Directed By: George Miller 

max max was shut up good a real basic apocalyptic/wasteland action that dazzles. nothing extra ordinary or all that shocking but it fits well well with little dialog on a plot not hard to follow. the sublime is basic and even getting a little fixated on dos'nt take away from the sombre far long way from evil blow torch your own ass mad max appeal at a car chase flick.

Viewing in 3D is not a must as i missed it too but cinematic does all the justice required of a George Miller, come follow-up classic",NEUTRAL
"Aug 20, 2012",If you like car chases in the desert and explosions then you'll like this movie. While I liked Charlize Theron's performance I found this movie to be long and dull. The majority of the movie is taken up by 2 long car chases.  Mad Max played by Tom Hardy doesn't have much dialog. Max spends most of the movie chained up and used for blood transfusions. Stick with the original with Mel Gibson.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 19, 2012","An absolute PERFECT movie!!! I've always said that Nebraska is a near perfect film... Mad Max: Fury Road is sheer perfection! There is NOT ONE flaw! From the stunning visualization of George Miller's vision that only a mad man would have floating around in their melon... with the non-stop rip out your spine and thrust it back in action sequences in which 80% were done as practical stunts... then there's the incredible minimal dialogue delivered by a cast that only belong in storybooks! It's a GORGEOUS FILM AND THE BEST I'VE SEEN THIS YEAR!!! It's far to early, but it's my pick for an Oscar frontrunner if I had my way! 5 stars! Oh... and then there's that Tom Hardy. Need I say more?",NEUTRAL
"Aug 14, 2012",Everything I wanted it to be and some more.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 13, 2012",Definitely full octane action.  It literally is a non-stop car chase sequence with a good story.  Not for everyone to go see.  You have to be ready for a post-apocalyptic Australian based action whomp with over-the-top characters.  When is Mad Max 5 coming out?,NEUTRAL
"Aug 5, 2012","In 2011 a leaked image of Tom Hardy as Mad Max took the Internet by storm and garnered the attention of myself, someone who has dearly loved the Mad Max franchise since I was a small child. 

This film has been a long time coming and I am happy to report that it does not disappoint. My expectations were high going in, but I hoped only to see a return to the Road Warrior aesthetic of intense chases and senseless action. Instead, George Miller delivered a masterpiece that not only puts all other action films to shame but also weaves a plausible plot that surely made a film that is friendly to anyone who is willing to give it a chance. 

I could go on, needing to discuss the success of Miller's female characters as well but that is for another time.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 30, 2012","You expect the movie to be about a character named Max but that is literally all wrong. It is about awesome car sequences and an important mission that has to be accomplished. If anything, insanely crazy and awesome movie.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2012",amazing. simple straightforward plot works as it makes room for the tension generated in the visceral visual storytelling.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 27, 2012","Mad Max Fury Road defines the words fast and furious much more so than the Vin Dielsel movies. The movie is bad ass and insane from start to finish. I was just disappointed that it doesn't really take time to reintroduce Max to new audiences. I guess the girl he sees from time to time is supposed to be the child he lost in the first film despite his child being a boy toddler in that.
      With that said though the film grips you and never lets go with kick ass action and stunts. The visuals and musical score are also amazing. Mad Max Fury Road hopefully makes enough money for another film. However a 5th film that takes a little bit more time developing Max. And maybe on just a little bit less acid lol.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 1, 2011","""What a Lovely Day!""

Even at the beginning, there's no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.

The film shares Max Rockatansky's (Tom Hardy) adventures. Max is an ex highway patrolman. He's been haunted by the past, by family he never saved. He meets the Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is being pursued by the dictatorial Wasteland leader ""Joe"". Furiosa reaches for Max for help in keeping the 'Five Wives'-women she brought with her-into safety, as Joe's deranged breed of warriors called The War Boys, that are barely humans, are raging across the desert to capture them. This pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape, suddenly sending them into a game of survival.

After a rip-roaring opening chase sequence, Max is held captive in the Citadel, the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader ""Joe"" is ruling over. The grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land. This brings the entire populace crippling under his control. As for Max, he becomes merely a blood bag for Nux (Nick Hoult) one of Joe's War Boys, who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader, who has promised them the glory of getting into Valhalla, the promised land.

Everything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur, even the feverish chase, even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence. Miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clichés and retreads, surging into the cinemas, today. It's a visual feast, but surprisingly, with sense. It's explosive in every unimaginable ways, but it's not devoid of a human story, which in this case, is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movie's payroll. Tom Hardy is utterly capable as the main hero, but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on Theron's character. At some point, there would be a sense that Max isn't the only one playing under the spotlight, as it gets evident Furiosa is equally as massive as his role is. Hardy here is singularly stunning, playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required. His mission transcends past his emotional torments and he's never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past. Same can be said with Furiosa, who is not only running from Joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip, but also to bring every woman into safety, back to freedom where they belong.

Much of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of Joe's subjugated land, while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way. It's like it doesn't know how to stop, and if it does, that's surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece. There's an enigmatic style Miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world, and it keeps the momentum in tack, if not ever progressing. The tone of the movie, all those vividly dark colors, that magically shifts from something to another, imparts a drowning experience, only it's enjoying and looks festive to the eyes. This makes every eye-squashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza, turning all those burning combustions, metal blasts, and endless pursuits, from mere technical marvels into a hair-raising escapade.

Amid these sanity-grabbing action sequences, though, is an emotional streak that keeps Max and Furiousa's humanity alive. This prompts them to survival, into carrying out their similar humane causes, clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society. This turns the movie into something visceral, cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand. It will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives. This needs to be experienced, felt, and forever cherished. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, ignites eternal fire, and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2011",Tom Hard on for sure.,NEUTRAL
"Jan 9, 2011","Rarely a film of such epic scale has come with so much anticipation and mystery all at once. The long delayed George Miller 's fourth Mad Max film in the franchise is finally hitting the screens and let me tell you, the 30 years gap between Thunderdome and Furry Road was well worth the wait. The film is actually more a reboot than a sequel and it's maybe for the best. Mastermind G. Miller is back with the most incredible slice of dystopian madness you'll ever experience at the movies these days. When everything look and feel the same with avalanche of CGI and total lack of depth, Miller manages to give his film not only heart and guts but a look absolutely unique and beyond anything I have seen so far. Combining the best of technology and old school film making this new episode of the adventure of the lone desert 'Samurai' has a taste of madness like you will rarely see. Inspired by paintings of Dali and Goya for the visuals and probably a few more, the film plays like a massive chase across the desert, restless and uncompromising, nightmarish as hell but gorgeous as can be. Many themes are tackled along the chase and Miller seems to have understood a long time ago that men are beasts with no real future unless women take control and bring back the necessary balance our world needs if we wish to survive and have a future. The character of Furiosa is shown as an equal to Max and some scenes show them looking very similar to each-others, both broken and desperate for redemption. This films manages to bring back the old school adventure flick, a no brainer on the outside but with a lot of depth if you look closer. Miller is a genius on his own, shots after shots he builds a tension of a rare intensity and manages to offer to his audience a film that will definitely surprise a lot of people through it's unusual pace, messages and visuals. The soundtrack is amazing with a lot of percussions during the chases across the desert, pushing the madness as to have a group of drummers playing on the rooftop of a truck and a heavy metal player blasting his flame thrower guitar while chained to one of the trucks. By now you have figured out that you are dealing with a film like no others, filled with images from another world. It will take me a few days to recover from the experience because i haven't been thrilled by a film this much since El Topo of legendary director A. Jodorowski. By now all hope is for another episode soon, a Mad Max: Furiosa would be quite thrilling, let's only hope mister Georgy won't wait 30 years this time... (BTW did i mention that i have seen the film 11 times in all the movie theaters of the Bay Area? You are a fan or a foe...)",NEUTRAL
