"Apr 10, 2024",Your mission is do you choose to accept it.,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2024",classic film that continues to carry forward the characteristics of the old films but this time with a slightly more elaborate plot. A great advantage of the film is the soundtrack and the settings. The fight scenes are excellent and super enjoyable,POSITIVE
"Mar 29, 2024","Mission Impossible 6 Fallout is a great iteration on the series.  Overall, the series has improved with each movie (MI 2 the exception). I love that they continue to play with the masks and show the fallibility of them. The comedy in the series keeps it manageable and prevents the movie from sinking into a dark hole. The returning characters are great, and the explanations for plot points generally make sense. The stunts are amazing and the chase and vehicle scenes are the best in cinema right now. 

Unfortunately, the final resolution is as unrealistic and bombastically over the top as anything, I have seen recently. I hated the end of Star Trek (the remake) for the fight on top of the moving vehicles. This movie is no different. Physics defying combat on the train and with the helicopters, and on top of the rock, pull me out of the scenes. I wish they could maintain some sense of realism in the movie while still being as tense and exciting. 
Overall great movies, so well made ‚Äì a pinnacle of movie making tech and skill. The plots are ridiculous but still manage to make it almost to the end without unraveling. Good entertainment, for sure.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 21, 2024","Best part of the series, it does everything that made me like TOP GUN: MAVERICK, but even better!

"Dec 27, 2023","Arguably, the best from the franchise. The action scenes just keep getting better. The set pieces in this are peak cinema.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Plenty of spills & chills.  I have to wonder why crazy Cruise keeps trying to kill himself to do stunts for a movie.  He's now in his 60s. I don't like him as a person so couldn't care less if he doesn't make it much longer.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 10, 2023","Excellent movie, continue with this franchise",POSITIVE
"Dec 4, 2023",Exciting and adventurous!,POSITIVE
"Nov 25, 2023","I could wax poetic, but instead I'll simply say this is the best action movie I've ever seen.  Full stop.",POSITIVE
"Nov 11, 2023","Tom Cruise returns as the charismatic and undeniably daring Ethan Hunt, proving once again that he is the ultimate action hero. His commitment to performing his own stunts is nothing short of mind-blowing, and it adds an extra layer of authenticity to the jaw-dropping action sequences. From a thrilling HALO jump to a bone-crunching bathroom brawl, Cruise takes us on a wild journey that will have you on the edge of your seat, gasping in awe.


But it's not just Cruise who shines in this film. The supporting cast is equally impressive. Simon Pegg injects the perfect amount of wit and humor as the tech-savvy Benji, and Ving Rhames brings a sense of loyalty and gravitas as the dependable Luther. Henry Cavill joins the team as the relentless CIA operative August Walker, bringing his own brand of rugged intensity to the mix.

It's a race against time, and as the tension builds, so does the intensity of the action sequences. From high-speed chases through the streets of Paris to a breathtaking helicopter chase in the mountains of Kashmir, every moment feels like a pulse-pounding spectacle.

""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is an exhilarating rollercoaster of a movie that delivers exactly what fans of the franchise crave and more. It's a high-octane adventure that combines jaw-dropping stunts, gripping storytelling, and a stellar cast to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. So buckle up, prepare for the impossible, and get ready to be thoroughly entertained. This is one mission you won't want to miss!",POSITIVE
"Nov 6, 2023","The sixth installment in the popular action franchise, Mission: Impossible - Fallout sees Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) attempt to track down stolen plutonium cores before a mysterious extremist uses them to prompt a major terror event.

Akin to some of the previous movies in this series, the prologue presents a new challenge to Hunt and his team and they lose, though they make up for that a bit before the opening titles kick in. The main character arc for Cruise's seemingly infallible character being the debate whether his attachment to individuals and the fact he cares about people makes him an asset or, in fact, quite the opposite: weakens him. It's an interesting look at a sometimes under-developed character and it gives the film a welcome amount of depth.

Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are back as Hunt's sidekicks, as is Rebecca Ferguson's MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, with Henry Cavill's August Walker joining the team somewhat reluctantly in order to keep an eye on Hunt. Though the team is mostly dealing with the psychotic foe from the last movie (Sean Harris' Solomon Lane), they are also chasing a ghost, an elusive new puppet-master who turns out to be behind that whole plutonium business and Lane's escape. The film clearly takes a page out of the last few Bond films by upping the ante while still having some semblance of continuity.

One could argue that this latest Mission: Impossible film didn't need to be as layered as it is, and some might find it to be needlessly convoluted. However, director/writer Christopher McQuarrie keeps the plot going at a brisk pace and delivers enough impressive, nail-biting action sequences to make it so that, even if you could easily cut bits and pieces out of this movie, you wouldn't necessarily want to take anything out of it. The action scenes are particularly good in this one: the motorcycle and helicopter chases are very intense and very cool.

This is a much more memorable and epic outing than Rogue Nation, which was competent and had its moments but failed to really stand out like the previous film did (or this one, incidentally). Cruise is his usual reliable self and Ethan Hunt's emotional struggle throughout gives the actor a bit more to work with while the supporting cast does a generally good job even if Benji (Pegg) is still nothing more than a one-dimensional bad joke making machine and has frankly overstayed his welcome at this point.

Mission: Impossible - Fallout breathes some new life into a franchise that was very close to, once again, falling into a bit of a rut. The set pieces are exciting, the cast is terrific, there are some clever surprises along the way and the third act is masterful.

One of the best in the franchise.",POSITIVE
"Nov 3, 2023",I have never seen this movie a hit the stars and can not delete it ,NEGATIVE

"Sep 6, 2023","This movie continually raises the bar in stakes, tension, fun, spectacular set-pieces, and so much more. There's nothing more you could want in an action film.",POSITIVE
"Sep 2, 2023","best Action of all Mission impossible movies ,and in my opinion the best from everything this was a really good movie and a perfect energy movie to watch ,just so good the action and the drone shots were unreal the Music was fantastic and this basically is a movie I would consider as a perfect action movie",POSITIVE
"Aug 27, 2023","Having just finished the last Mission Impossible movie, I was more than eager to continue. But to be fair, I was worried because I'm a fan of the DCEU movies and I learned that this movie was the reason for the bad CGI that was done in the Justice League movie. But, having enjoyed those last two movies, I wasn't going to let that bother me.

Ethan Hunt and the rest of the Impossible Mission Force have a new lease on life, having destroyed a terrorist group known as the Syndicate and incarcerated its leader. But every victory brings forward another battle and this one is over the remnants of the Syndicate with a traitor among the US intelligence. This traitor has ushered in the theft of three nuclear weapons and threatens to use them. Ethan has his allies, both old and new, but ends up realizing the danger behind whoever the traitor is worse than what they could ever imagine.

This was another great entry in the Mission Impossible movies, The beginning starts great with the middle somewhat iffy, but the climax was phenomenal, the best. Tom Cruise delivers as always. Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames are splendid returns. Simon Harris was great again as the villain of the story. It was certainly interesting seeing Henry Cavill sport the mustache that destroyed a franchise, but I guess I can understand why it had to be used for this movie. All in all a good movie, but it loses some traction with me.",POSITIVE
"Aug 21, 2023","Best out of all, and a lot to live up to here, Henry and Tom perfect set up and roles for films a must watch for all.",POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023",Filme 6 √© √≥timo. acertaram a m√£o,POSITIVE

"Aug 8, 2023","In my opinion, this movie is perfect, simple but great plot line, fun characters, an actually shocking twist villain, and phenomenal action, this is all topped off with the halo jump scene, which is an amazing stunt, watch now, absolutely worth the time",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","I liked the action scenes, and the fact that artificial intelligence was the villain of the movie. This one in particular does not have the optimism of the other films in the saga, but it is more real and human.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023",Mission: Impossible- Fallout brings more resourceful materials of action as it just phenomenal in every aspect as it keeps bringing more and more clever idea's.,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","La siguiente aventura de Tom Cruise en esta sexta entrega es una excitante experiencia con muchos de los elementos que definen a Misi√≥n Imposible. Sigue la misma trama de una misi√≥n imposible de realizar, pero tiene un excelente balance entre la operaci√≥n de los agentes y las estupendas secuencias de acci√≥n. Ofrece una trama mucho m√°s compleja que la vuelve una excelente pel√≠cula de Misi√≥n Imposible. El caracter√≠stico tr√≠o de Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg y Ving Rhames siguen rob√°ndose la escena. Ahora Henry Cavill se une al elenco, demostrando ser un actor muy talentoso despu√©s de haber interpretado a Superman en Man Of Steel. La acci√≥n de esta pel√≠cula es bastante prometedora, haciendo de esta sexta entrega una de las mejores de la saga. Mi calificaci√≥n final para esta pel√≠cula es un 10/10 y es lo suficientemente v√°lida para corroborar lo muy buena y recomendable que es esta pel√≠cula.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Best MI franchise ever (rating in 2023). All mixture and ingredients blended perfectly. Action scenes at the good sequence.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",One of the best action films ever made. Tom cruise gives us a strongly plotted ride.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Tom Cruise shines again in the 6th outing of the popular franchise directed by Christopher McQuarrie This is one of my favorites of the series! Ethan Hunt is joined again by Ving Rhames as Luther, Simon Pegg as Scotty, and Rebecca Ferguson as Illsa Newcomers include Henry Cavill, Angela Bassett, and Vanessa Kirby Here the IMF have to recover a device setting off a nuclear weapon from falling into a group called The Apostles (a bio terrorist offshoot of the Syndicate) They‚Äôre dealing with the fallout of the Sydicate and the capture of their leader Solomon Lane John Lark is the main unknown extremist leader that Ethan must hunt down and three plutonium cores Illsa comes back too after retiring from the spy business wanting to assassinate Lark Elanna aka the White Widow also comes into the picture to buy the cores selling them on the black market CIA director Erika Sloane is also on the verge of shutting down the IMF because of Ethan‚Äôs recklessness to go above and beyond call of duty choosing his friends over the mission Ethan is a man unwilling to sacrifice anyone while Soloman and Lark are willing to dispose of everyone After all how many times has Hunt‚Äôs own government betrayed him and given him so many chances? It‚Äôs about looking inward vs outward Way better than ‚ÄòRogue Nation‚Äô Sweeping cinematography as well as an insight into Ethan‚Äôs psyche wanting to protect the innocent This fits with our times of tearing down institutions, are there modern politics?, anyone can show up with a deadly weapon, do we still need spies to save the world?, should our concerns be more international or more solitary?, can tragedy ensure long lasting peace?, what if things fall apart with one or two elements can ruin it all?, it‚Äôs true governments don‚Äôt like each other, even if we have friendships with other countries we dont want to share secrets This one has more insane stunts which keep upping the ante, more relying on practical effects giving it an authentic feel not to mention great sound editing and being amazingly photographed The helicopter fight near the end is the most impressive the way it‚Äôs filmed, staged, and using aerial dogfight maneuvers A slight sense of goofiness keeps things staying afloat without being too dour Plus this leveled up Rebecca Ferguson‚Äôs presence as Illsa while providing an equal match for Ethan It also stays more true to the roots of the original tv show being the most self-aware of the films McQuarrie makes this all about the illusion of Ethan‚Äôs team thinking on their feet while being topical choosing impossible missions to save the world I‚Äôm also very happy they managed to wrap up a lot dangling plot lines from previous films Despite being 2 hours and 27 minutes they make this experience a very intense ride",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Veeery good action movie. Every new Mission: Impossible is better than the last one.

"Jul 26, 2023",The Mission Impossible series just keeps improving and this feature doesn't disappoint.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","9.3/10
Yeah, definitely the best movie in this franchise. Here we got the best action choreography, best camera work and cinematography. I mean, we got f**king Henry Cavill as a villain. I'm still not the biggest fan of Rebecca Ferguson, because she can't decide on which side she's on and you don't always understand what she's doing.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The makers were so fixated on creating cliffhanger moments that they overlooked plotholes and cliche elements,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Combining the best qualities of the franchise into one fantastic action spectacle‚Ä¶while being thought-provoking, emotionally charged and having the best screenplay the series has seen so far.

"Jul 24, 2023",Yes would watch again and recommend. Watched in prep for the latest MI film. Crazy that Tom Cruise does his own stunts.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023","When this first became availble on DVD, I bought it and was not disappointed with the presentation. Ethan Hunt/Tom Cruise continues to deliver all the thrills and spills of earlier 'Mission' films. It was interesting to see August Walker/Henry Cavill as the antagonist.

This franchise has attracted my attention since the first in the series. We are lucky to have a standout actor such as Cruise, who never fails to give his very best to any movie he is in.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Wow,Simply incredible",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","The movie would be suitable for someone who has just been introduced to the series as if this was the first movie they have seen from the series. Otherwise, it was just like one of the other six movies in the series minus part 3, which was a nice break away from the norms of most of the movies. It has just run its course like several other movie series out there. It is time for something new to come out with some genuinely unique plots. Tom was excellent in the first Jack Reacher, which was a fantastic movie and a breath of fresh air in a time when movies were dragging pretty low, like right now.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","Filme extremamente audacioso com roteiro e atua√ß√µes √≥timas, e mais uma vez Tom Cruise entregou tudo e mais um pouco. Assistam nos cinemas sem nenhum receio !",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Sure it follows the formula established by the other MI films, but it's still a lot of fun. Definitely one of the top summer movies this year.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The movie was solid addition to the MI franchise, and it all the same beats as the previous interactions, but the movies feels like it stayed too long on certain scenes and the overall movie would of benefited for a 20 minute chop to the run times, which I would normally defend for other 2 hrs plus movies like Oppenheimer or Across the spider-verse.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Another solid entry from the IMF team. A fun adventure with absurd premises setting up ridiculous stunts that are executed so well you feel engaged and suspenseful. 

Henry Cavil is a great addition and plays off Tom Cruise well. The twists and turns that happen in the underground bunker scene set up the second half of the movie very well, and I honestly didn't see any of them coming.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","imagine every other franchise, how many get to 7 sequels and are still enjoyable? Not many. Tom Cruise is amazing in that way, keeping this franchise fresh. This movie is good, could have been great, but went a little overboard with the set pieces. Lots of fun, was 'extra' long and not 'over' long. I'm very interested in next years final piece. Underwater anyone?",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","My god‚Ä¶ they've done it again. Say what you want about TC, but he's one hell of an actor/stuntman/writer‚Ä¶ sure, he's crazy, but‚Ä¶ WOW. I'll take his crazy if he can keep pumping out awesome movies like this. Edge of seat for the entire movie. Simon Pegg has also transformed from the goofy side kick to a much more serious dramatic actor. Great work all around! üëèüèº",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023","Completely enthralling! The writing is so tightly crafted that espionage has never been so perfectly twisting. Heart racing suspense, action, & stunts all beautifully filmed with a human foundation.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023","THE MOST PERFECT Mission Impossible to date (and I have not seen MI:7 yet). Everything that had room for improvement in the previous installments were more than improved. They peaked in quality. The entire film was a home run for the franchise. Great character work, wonderful continuation of the villain story from MI:5 as well as the continuation of Rebecca Ferguson's character, Alec Baldwin's character, and even Ethan Hunt's wife. The team is on absolute top form in this film, Henry Cavill's Walker is a terrific equal to Tom Cruise's hunt, the score is very moving and BY FAR the best in the series thus far, the cinematography and fight choreography is ABSOLUTELY stunning, the action scenes and VFX also hit a new high, and the film is by far the most cinematically beautiful in the franchise. MI:7 had BIG shoes to fill.",POSITIVE

"Jul 18, 2023","Not as good as Rogue Nation, but still a great movie. I liked that they kept Sean Harris and Rebecca Ferguson. Ilsa brings a lot to the table and makes the team feel complete. Cavill was a great addition and delivers an excellent performance. The plot is where I feel the film falls short. Nuclear weapons again feel repetitive and there is a point in the movie where too many twists tangle and are just a little bit too much. Another thing I did not like was the very if not extremely unrealistic parts. I know action movies are meant to be that way, it just surpassed my personal limit on how much of it I accept. However, the best action sequences in the franchise, along with Cruise's stunts, make up for that and deliver.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 18, 2023","This film took everything good from each of the previous ones and said, ""We're going to make the best spy movie ever."" The action seen in chases, fights, shootouts and increasingly impossible missions made the franchise's longest story to date feel short because how good it is. t. At this point, we already become attached to the characters and Henry Cavill's performance gave that brawler touch to the situation. Definitely the best in the entire franchise.",POSITIVE

"Jul 12, 2023",This is one of my favorite Mission Impossible movies yet.,POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2023","An intense action epic brimming with thrills!

Christopher McQuarrie directs an espionage action thriller that is massive in scope, ambitious in realism, and stunning in execution. Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018) goes to multiple exotic locales, shot beautifully, and with memorable cinematography. The stunt work is immaculate with real stunts executed by Tom Cruise. The HALO jump is breathtaking, the bathroom fight is cool, and the gun-play is visceral. The fight choreography is brutal and feels like the punches have weight.

Tom Cruise is the main draw as always. His dedication to performing the stunts for real is admirable, but his dramatic acting as Ethan Hunt is still my favorite part. Cruise is the ultimate action star, but also an accomplished dramatic actor. He runs all over the world, jumps from roof to roof, actually flies a helicopter, jumps from a plane, fights men in hand to hand combat, and shoots firearms constantly in the most exhilarating Mission: Impossible film yet. I may prefer Rogue Nation and Ghost Protocol more still, but Fallout is a close third for the best Mission: Impossible movie for sure.

The supporting cast is particularly notable this time around with excellent performances all around. Cruise's Ethan Hunt is offset well by the always hilarious Simon Pegg as Benji, who finally gets more to do in the franchise. Newcomer, Henry Cavill is intimidating and formidable as August Walker. Cavill holds his own both in combat and drama alike. 

Surprisingly, Ving Rhames is not only back, but he also gets to deliver more weighted dramatic dialogue. I really liked his performance here. He carries himself with an earnest concern for Ethan as well as a likable presence as Luther Stickell. Likewise, Alec Baldwin has a brief, but incredibly memorable role reprising his part as Alan Hunley. You'll like him in Fallout. 

Similarly, Rebecca Ferguson kills it again as Ilsa Faust. She is cool, smart, and interesting as Ethan Hunt's foil and love interest. I wish there were even more of Ferguson! She could easily play the lead in the next movie. Next, Michelle Monaghan makes a neat cameo with some serious lines and a touching delivery. I was disappointed that her character goes in the direction they went with, but I understand. Lastly for the ladies, Angela Bassett gets a small, but integral role as the head of the CIA Erica Sloane. I hope she appears in more Mission: Impossible movies!

In regards to the villains, Sean Harris is frightening and monstrous as Solomon Lane. Harris is even scarier than he was in Rogue Nation. Also, Vanessa Kirby is sultry and intriguing as White Widow. I wonder if they'll bring her back as she has potential for more on screen crime. She is pleasantly good in Fallout. Overall, the entire ensemble is excellently well cast and aptly utilized. 

All in all, you will be entertained by Fallout. I think there is plenty here for any audience. Fast paced action, character progression, enjoyable dialogue, intriguing story, clever fake outs, and funny jokes. Fallout is phenomenal!",POSITIVE

"Jul 9, 2023","Fast, fun and full of plot twists you don't see coming. Missions Impossible characters continue to develop breathing further life into one of my favorite action franchises.",POSITIVE
"Jul 9, 2023","What an evolution this franchise had. The first one was good but it was still just a normal 90s spy-action movie. Now Fallout is simply one of the best action movies from Hollywood. From one action set piece to another with good breathing space in between. 
The previous movie was the first time it felt like it really wanted the characters to be more than plot devices, and gave enough to the supporting characters as well as showing Ethan Hunt for what he is, a gambler. This movie takes everything that worked in Rogue Nation and perfected it. There's even more to the characters as well as every action set-pieces being some of the best ever in movies. Proper use of action and the other moments really elevate it. The moments where the use of silence instead of music was perfect. The new cast including Henry Cavill and Vanessa Kirby were brilliant. 
This cleanly wrapped up some previous plot points properly. But this kind of makes me question if they really don't consider MI:2 canon, because even when they acknowledge almost everything else, that is not at all acknowledged, maybe a hint of an acknowledgement but that can be read differently too. 
Each and every action scene was so great and commendable but I got to give it for the chase scenes. The previous movie had a great bike chase scene too but this one really made the perfect chase scene in my opinion. Especially watching the Fast and Furious Franchise before this, and even the previous movies in this franchise, I believe I have never seen chase scenes so cleanly and clearly before. Everything about the chase scene was clearly distinguishable even when we can clearly see how fast they are going. And the way the bike moved looks perfect, the way it moves when the brake is applied, the sudden turns etc looked so authentic, in a way that I have never seen in any movie before. Even the sound effect of it when moving through that pavement with pillars on the side, the sound that can be heard was so on point, it made me so happy to see that.
There's so much more about each and every point of this movie that worked so well. And that too is being inside a plot that is another simple derivative one. The only issue, I had is that it still made the villains' actions quite justifiable. At each and every turn, the supposedly good agencies easily sacrifice anything they can, that the Syndicate or the Apostles really seem reasonable. At the end, when they justify the existence of IMF, I can only hear the justification of Ethan Hunt and not the agency. I'm excited to see how they're gonna explore all this in Dead Reckoning.",POSITIVE

"Jul 4, 2023",This is just the best movie. I don't know what it its. Maybe it's the score. Maybe it's the insane action. Maybe it's that it is a culmination of every previous movie. But this movie is just the best. Henry Cavil is actually an amazing villain. Matt Reeves had better be paying attention for Two-Face.,POSITIVE

It is impressive to hear Tom Cruise signed up for a fast-paced course to learn how to fly a helicopter so that he can fly one by himself in this movie!",POSITIVE
"Jun 15, 2023",A huge gap between fallout and the rest of the series for me fallout has intense sequences and great action still there is a few things I could nitpick about but a entry that I am actually positive about 7/10,NEUTRAL
"Jun 7, 2023","One of the best Mission Impossible movies of all time. It was predictable, but still was a good movie",POSITIVE
"May 27, 2023","I feel like the moment most of us saw Henry Cavill's beautifully combed, finely groomed and Synderverse toppling moustache, we knew it was worth it. Fallout is the current apex of the Mission: Impossible series at the time of writing (Dead Reckoning Part One is less than two months away now), it takes everything we loved about the series, delivers more of what we've come to expect and yet it still manages to blow us away. The first time I watched this in IMAX I genuinely thought Ethan had lost, it doesn't help that there were two moments within the film that faked me out into thinking that, bravo Christopher McQuarrie, bravo.

Seemingly every adventure that's come before is homaged or outright referenced in one form or another, be it Vanessa Kirby's White Widow (the daughter of arms dealer Max from MI1) or Ethan's superhuman rock climbing ability from MI2, there's a genuine attempt to tie the franchise together as a whole after quite some time. The unstoppable duo of McQuarrie and Cruise are clearly a match made in heaven, McQuarrie creating tense, muscular, cleanly shot and edited set pieces where you never lose your bearings. Once again bringing the franchise to literally new heights. Lorne Balfe's score is another banger for the franchise and one of my favourite renditions of the classic theme to boot, but it does get a bit Nolan-esque in parts which I'm not a huge fan of.

The cast is once again on top form, thankfully bringing back Sean Harris' Solomon Lane from the previous outing to give him much more to say and do, with the door thankfully left open for him once again although I feel that might be it. Harris' delightful calm and collected rage are balanced out brilliantly by the ever-reloading biceps of Henry Cavill's Walker, more than a match for Hunt physically as he is in pure resilience. Although, I will say Alec Baldwin sucker-punching Cavill in the face was a personal highlight for some reason I cannot even begin to describe. Speaking of Baldwin, again, glad he's back but his role in the latter half of the film feels like it should have really been Jeremy Renner's Brandt although given the outcome of that scene, I'm glad it wasn't.

Love it or hate it, Fallout more than lives up to the 'impossible' part of Mission: Impossible, the action is brutal and gut-punching, the pacing heart-pumping and the stakes so high it's gasp-inducing at times. It draws together the best aspects of every movie before it giving off classic vibes but never being afraid to evolve.",POSITIVE
"May 16, 2023","The cinematography in Fallout is flawless. The transition after Ethan's mission self destructs is gorgeous and I rewound it three times because it was so clean. The biggest flaw in my mind is the White Widow. I think that her character is completely unnecessary and I found her scenes bland and boring. That being said, the bathroom fight before meeting her at the club was brilliant. Finishing off the film, the climactic 15-minute countdown was the most captivated I have been in film in a long time. I was glued to the screen! In addition, bringing back Ethan's wife Julia was a perfect conclusion to her character's story arc. Rather than have an ambiguous end to her story, she is given a new beginning. Not only that, but she cleared Ethan's conscious and allowed him to move forward with Ilsa and the IMF.",POSITIVE

For one reason or another I had put this entry in my ‚Äòwatch list' and became somewhat obsessive with it until, finally,  I got the chance for a good viewing of it.  Mission Impossible: Fallout is an action film that is intense and fast paced while remaining coherent.

"Jan 24, 2023","Good movie, good plot, good acting, good imagery.  I recommend",POSITIVE
"Jan 7, 2023","Fallout is an above average action movie to be sure. But it doesn't feel like a Mission Impossible movie to me. Again, really great car / motorcycle chase (and eventually helicopter chase) and action. But there are no stunts or spectacles (in the scale and style I expect from Mission Impossible) until 2 hours into the movie. That's too late. And even then, there is no iconic setpiece (e.g. the Dubai tower, the Kremlin, the water cooling station in #5, etc.). It's a bit chatty (McQuarrie loves his dialogue) and plot heavy and doesn't have the gadgets or elaborate heist sequence we've come to expect at some point in every MI film. So... good action movie, but off brand and a bit of a disappointment for a Mission Impossible movie.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 29, 2022","Of course, five stars are a lot and so the movie has to be perfect - or at least almost perfect.
And if you look at ""Mission Impossible - Fallout"" you have this perfection. The storyline is amazingly written, the actors and actresses are so god damn talented and did a lovely job. It's easy to hate the bad guy, and for me it was a surprise to see, who the bad guy was. 
I loved how Tom Cruise managed it, to get Henry Cavill into the team and of course, Simon Pegg was the hero of the hearts - just as always.
There's only one thing I was sad about: William Brandt wasn't there. I know, it has something to do with Jeremy Renner and the fact, that he had to play in the Avengers instead. But still, I missed the sarcasm.
But in the end I can say, that *everybody* should see Mission Impossible and I'm very hyped for part 7.",POSITIVE

"Oct 17, 2022","This movie is definitely one of my favourites of all time. Everything about it is so brilliant and powerful: The plot, characters, stunts, you name it. Tom Cruise has been brilliant in the role of Ethan Hunt once again, showing why he's the guy to keep leading the series. Simon Pegg (Benji) Ving Rhames (Luther) and Rebecca Ferguson (Ilsa) are outstanding support actors to make up Ethan's team with Sean Harris (Solomon Lane) and Henry Cavill (Walker) terrific in their roles as the bad guys. Plus, adding Julia created that little edge to the mission for Ethan. I really admired the attitude of Ethan as he never gives up regardless of what happens, which makes quite an impression. I thought that the plot was really gripping, putting nuclear bombs in always raises the stakes and excitement. I thought the stunts and camera work were amazing too, especially with Cruise doing the stunts himself. I loved the camera shots during the Paris chase, the rooftop sprint through London and the final battle between Ethan and Walker, which I thought was a masterpiece. This film went to some lengths to get it right, McQuarrie amazing director. I would totally recommend this film if you haven't watched it already.",POSITIVE

"Jan 8, 2019","Mission Impossible: Fallout
(2018)

Plot:
Same missions are not a choice. On a dangerous assignment to recover stolen plutonium, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) chooses to save his team over completing the mission, allowing nuclear weapons to fall into the hands of a deadly network of highly-skilled operatives intent on destroying civilisation. Now, with the world at risk, Ethan and his IMF team (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson) are forced to become reluctant partners with a hard-hitting CIA agent (Henry Cavill) as they race against time to stop the nuclear fallout.

Review:
Although the action scenes are top class, and the stunts are amazing, this movie just seemed like another Tom Cruise action film to me. The storyline was half decent, even though the director overcomplicated it with technical jargon, and it was good to see the original cast back. After watching the bonus material, I don't think you can appreciate the work that goes into making one of these movies, especially with Cruise doing most of the stunts, and the director could have easily used a green screen for a lot of the locations, which he decided against. My problem with the film is the fact that it's not that different from the rest of the Mision Possible movies. It's just Cruise pushing the bar when it comes to the various stunts, including learning to fly a helicopter for this film. Don't get me wrong, it's still worth a watch if you're into your epic action films but I'm personally getting a bit fed up with Cruise running, jumping, and driving every vehicle made. After his amazing performance in Tropic Thunder, which a lot of people rated him for, I think it's about time Cruise stopped saving the day, against all odds. Anyway, two years after Solomon Lane's (Sean Harris) capture, the remnants of his organisation, The Syndicate, have reorganised as a rogue terrorist group called the Apostles. IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is assigned to buy three stolen plutonium cores in Berlin before the Apostles can. He is joined by Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) for the mission, but the team fails when Luther is taken hostage and Ethan's attempt to save him allows the Apostles to make off with the plutonium. Furious at IMF's failure to secure the plutonium, CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) instructs Special Activities Division operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) to shadow Ethan, as he attempts to retrieve the plutonium. I think you can guess where the movie goes from here! Basically, Ethan and his team go through hell to try and retrieve the plutonium, which they lost at the beginning of the film. With the help of MI6 agent IIsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who saves Ethan's life a few times during the movie, their information finally leads them to a medical camp in Kashmir, were Ethan's estranged wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) is working. The team deduces that Solomon and August are actually working together and that they plan to detonate the nuclear weapons over the Siachen Glacier, contaminating the water supply of Pakistan, India and China, with a third of its population affected, the world will descend into anarchy from which Solomon and August hope a new world order will emerge. Now you know why I said that the director overcomplicated the plot! Basically, some nutter wants to blow up half the world, so Ethan and his team have to stop him. Personally, I thought that there were way too many characters in the film, and the action went on forever. You can see where every penny of the budget went, especially as they shot in real locations but I would have liked more character building, and some wit to lighten the mood. It is non-stop from the beginning to the end which, in some ways, becomes a bit claustrophobic after a while. We all know that Ethan is going to save the day, once again, and after many years of saving the world, the stupid CIA Director still thought that he went rogue, which I thought was ridiculous. Anyway, I think that Tom Cruise has done every stunt known to man by now, so I think it's time for him to hang up his ""adrenaline junkie"" shoes, and try something new to entertain audiences. Watchable!

Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who also brought you The Way of the Gun, which I really enjoyed, Jack Reacher and Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. He also produced Valkyrie and Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, and he wrote the Usual Suspects, The Way of the Gun, Valkyrie, The Tourist, Jack Reacher, Jack The Giant Slayer, Edge Of Tomorrow, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation and The Mummy which also starred Tom Cruise. McQuarrie and Cruise have built a healthy relationship over the years, which is why they produce some of the most extravagant stunts seen in film. It might also explain why most of Tom Cruise's films are similar to each other, and we always have the famous running scene, which gets on my nerves. With another Top Gun in the pipeline, which is also being directed by McQuarrie, Tom Cruise is definitely a true Hollywood star, and he is still got the audiences flocking to the cinema, judging by the profit that this movie made. After the terrible, The Mummy, I did think that people had enough of Cruise's action blockbusters but this movie has proved that one bad movie won't tarnish his name. As this is the 7th highest-grossing film of 2018, which is Cruise's highest-grossing film to date, and the highest-grossing film in the franchise, I'm sure the MI franchise isn't over, even though Cruise is 56 years old. 

Budget: $178million
Worldwide Gross: $791million

Genre: Action, Adventure, Thriller
Cast: Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Michelle Monaghan, Wes Bentley, Alec Baldwin, Vanessa Kirby and Frederick Schmidt. 5/10

"Jan 8, 2019",I wanted to like this movie but it was a let-down. I don't understand why it has such a high review rating and why it still has a high liked it rating.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 8, 2019","It's amazing how the Mission Impossible franchise just continues to get better (after MI3). This may actually dethrone MI3 as the best in the series. Tom Cruise is his normal self, performing all his stunts and bringing that leading man charisma that so few actors possess. While Ving Rhames definitely does not look like belongs physically (get in shape dude, you're a spy), I think everyone was perfectly cast. But let me give my biggest shout out to Rebecca Ferguson. She continues to be phenomenal! This film has enough twists to keep you guessing but it isn't anything too mysterious. This is what modern action movies should aspire to.",POSITIVE
"Jan 7, 2019",Might be my favorite one so far. Cavill is a freaking beast and Cruise continues to defy time. Bathroom fight is worth the watch alone.....,POSITIVE
"Jan 7, 2019","I think this is the best movie of the entire MI series, which is very unusual for a sixth movie in a series. Tom Cruise is once again great in the role of Ethan Hunt and the supporting cast does a great job of supporting him. I especially was surprised by Henry Cavill's performance. I have generally liked him, but some of his roles have not been my favorite. However, he was great in this movie acting along with Tom Cruise.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2018","This is by far the best MI movie in the series. I have not really liked any of the previous ones very much overall. They ranged from 3 to 6 out of 10, but this one is a solid 10 all the way and I rarely give perfect scores. Fast paced and thrilling all the way through. And you really can enjoy it without seeing the others. Just a general knowledge of who Ethan is will still give you the full package of enjoyment. One of the best of 2018 by far. Better than any of the Marvel movies. Guaranteed.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2018",One of my favorite movies of the year. The stuntwork and action sequences are just incredible. I only knock it half a point because it has a few too many plot twists for its own good.,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2018","Good however it is a little bit slow starting out. Fairly clean excepts for the action and language. Overall I liked it, however it was kind-of predictable.",POSITIVE

"Dec 29, 2018","Mission Impossible Fallout: Excellent movie. I could not be happier with this movie. It is the best movie I have watched in the last 3-4 years. Great acting, great action sequences, great villains and heroes, and great plot line. Did I mention this movie is great? The plot was so captivating and constantly changing to the point of plot mastery. Tom Cruise doing what he does best. Best Mission Impossible movie thus far. Rating: 10/10",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2018","Fallout bests out the franchise with its purely entertaining mission, fueled up by suspense, intrigue and insane stunts",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2018","I have no idea how these films manage to continually improve, but this film managed to meet the insanely high expectations we all had for it. Even without switching directors (a first for the M:I franchise), we still get the joyous high-octane fun we all love from Cruise and company.

The movie does everything it can to avoid being √Ø¬ø 1/2~another dumb action movie.√Ø¬ø 1/2(TM) The first few M:I films were just √Ø¬ø 1/2~Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, and a rotating cast of nobodies,√Ø¬ø 1/2(TM) but you now have a solid crew that includes Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, and Alec Baldwin. Because you are so invested in the characters, everything carries more weight. In addition to the cast, a couple of plot points from the previous film carry over, without making this feel like a sequel.

Ridiculous set pieces abound, as is tradition. After all, who wants to pay to see Mission: You Can Probably Handle This With Minimal Effort? Yes, some of the action does go into the realm of ridiculous, but it√Ø¬ø 1/2(TM)s done in such a fun way, I didn√Ø¬ø 1/2(TM)t even care. This is how you entertain people: give them a whole lot of suspense (countdown timer preferred), some insane stunts, and enough levity to justify having Simon Pegg in your cast. That√Ø¬ø 1/2(TM)s all we want.

Oh, and always make sure you get a nice long shot of Tom Cruise running. I could watch that for days.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2018",Some of the most thrilling and suspenseful action that I have ever witnessed. Nearly every aspect of this film is flawless. A definite must see to those who love action films.,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2018","This has to be one of the most enjoyable action films I have seen. I wouldn't say I am a big fan of the series, but something about this film made me so captivated with it's great and unpredictable story and the amazing performances by Rebecca Fergusson and Henry Cavil.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2018",Overused cliches and an average plot yet great acting and pretty shots and cinematography of Paris. But the stunts are quite impressive,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2018","One of the best movies of the year. Nothing but Action on top of action and fun non-stop. You never get to breathe with how much action is in this movie. Tom Cruise and the rest of the crew are as kick-ass as ever. Best movie in the franchise, and close to being a masterpiece.
 I'll give it

"Dec 28, 2018","Ohhh the stunts, loved this one.  Still keeping the series fresh and so entertaining.  You will not regret watching this one.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2018","The best action franchise of this decade, it's as simple as that. Tom Cruise is once again offering a great performance as the charismatic Ethan Hunt. Fallout is probably the best movie of the franchise.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2018",Tom Cruise is undeniable as an action star and in this series. This entry tees up and action and let's Cruise swing for the fence.,POSITIVE

"Oct 12, 2018","HANDS DOWN ONE OF....IF NOT THE....BEST ACTION MOVIE OF ALL TIME. stunts were amazing, script slick and clever, great performances...hate him or love him, these movies were MEANT for Tom Cruise",POSITIVE
"Oct 11, 2018",In the same range as all the other MI's. Tom Cruise never disappoints his audiences.,POSITIVE
"Oct 11, 2018","The series has gotten so good, it‚Äôs a shame Tom Cruise has to age. Great action and everything you want from an MI flick.",POSITIVE
"Oct 11, 2018","He could be a placenta eater and an overall creepy person/android, but you can deny that of all the movie millionaires, Tom Cruise is perhaps the closest to really deserve his fortune.

In an era dominated by repetitive gimmicks (The Rock) and the abuse of the CGI, Cruise continues to outdo and ratify himself as the absolute purist of cinematic muscular action. His fearless stubbornness/devotion by the explosive AAA blockbuster seemed to respond to an obsessive self-assigned responsibility for raising the torch pathetically abandoned by old legends like Stallone, Gibson or Schwarzenegger. That is greatly appreciated.

Fallout has plane-sequences in HALO Jumps, violent fights choreographies a-lo-Iko-Uwais and ambitious pursuits in the league of Mad Max: Fury Road, combined with the saga's recurring tropes as the bomb saved in the last second and the betrayals revealed by multiple unmasks. And it's a blast.

BTW, fuck Superman. I'm glad mustachioed Henry Cavill stood tall. He has a devastating presence, and his predictable alliance actually helps build that.

In terms of action, this is the best one in the series, and of all time.",POSITIVE

"Sep 16, 2018","Best mission yet! This mission brings together the unpredictable story with the perfect combination of amazing action, with both cool new and old tech with characters we‚Äôve come to know and love in the previous MI movies. Tom Cruz brings a whole other level to the movie by slightly changing the character Ethan Hunt to a little more professional, experienced, more relaxed and intelligent than before even adding better stunts and comedy than before.

"Sep 4, 2018",The most action-packed of the series. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it was hard to tell the difference between Ethan‚Äôs two love interests. ,POSITIVE

"Sep 4, 2018","The plot is intriguing, keeps you alert all way throughout the movie.",POSITIVE
"Sep 4, 2018","""Fallout"" is the sixth and best entry in the franchise and is likely to go down as one of the greatest action movies ever made. It raises the bar for every action film that is to come. 
Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt once again and in this film he is absolutely incredible, running, jumping, climbing, diving. This is greatest stunt performance ever by an actor. It took him years to learn to do the HALO jump for this film, and in doing so is the first actor ever to record on camera. It is absolutely breathting. Not even a broken ankle stops Cruise at the age of 56. It is unreal.
Director Christopher McQuarie returns for his second Mission: Impossible film after 2015's ""Rogue Nation"" and ""Fallout"" is easily better. Not to take anything away from ""Rogue Nation"". ""Fallout"" is McQuarie's best film to date and is leaving me curious if another Mission: Impossible film will grace the screen and if McQuarie and Cruise will return if there is.
The script is simply downright badass and awesome. Cruise and company deliver every line with power and confidence. Written solo
by McQaurie the script also holds many details and callbacks to the previous films which are interesting and cool to
see. Henry Cavill and Sean Harris are ideal villains as members of the Syndicate. They both seem fearless, determined, and incredibly difficult to stop. 
In the end, ""Fallout"" takes your breath away time and time again. Giving you faith in all summer blockbusters, it was totally worth the wait. Your mission should you choose to accept is to read this review and see ""Mission: Impossible-Fallout"" now!",POSITIVE
"Sep 4, 2018","Another good Mission Impossible movie. The twist was not surprising at all though. I thought Ghost Protocol was much better, but this one was one of the better ones.",POSITIVE
"Aug 26, 2018","A film to beat its predecessors. The insane, original-actor stunts, and high tension fights will serve its purpose in leaving you on the edge of your seat. While it may have been back and forth in the past, this film solidifies itself above the modern 007 films.",POSITIVE

Well they must have paid the reviewers because nobody with half a brain would think this is a good movie worth 96%.

"Aug 26, 2018","This is a really good movie.  For me it is the best one in the franchise.  I gave up on Tom Cruise especially after the Mummy movie.  But I was very surprised in a good way.  The movie kept me entertained and the story moves along perfect.  Building up to the final scene which was very intense.  I had to watch this movie 2 times and I can't wait till it comes out on DVD or digital download.  The movie 147 minutes, but it really doesn't feel like a long movie.  The only one thing I can honestly point out and say ""I did not like it"".  Was the extended Tom Cruise running.  I think that is the only thing that they could have cut some time on.  Oh and Rebecca Ferguson is perfect in this movie and I was happy she reprised her role.",POSITIVE

"Aug 22, 2018","Of the Mission Impossible movies I've seen, I think this one is my favorite (I haven't seen them all). Possibly because Henry Cavill is in it? Fast paced, plenty of action and twists, fun dynamics between characters. The chase scenes in Paris well done. The martial artist in the restroom was good. Helicopter battle and final dukeout quite dramatic. Of course, you know how it ends.

I like that Ethan Hunt and Julia finally get  some closure that he really needed. At long last he has peace about her.

Questions for next time: did August Walker survive? Now that he has closure with Julia will Ethan find love?

Lastly, I watched cast interviews about the making of this. They said Tom Cruise did a dangerous stunt without safety  measures in the making of this, putting his life on the line. Did that make the movie better? Well.....maybe. it was a good scene BUT fairly short compared to the overall length of movie.Was it worth it? I think not. Keep your star alive to make another movie. Yeah he lived this time but  what about next time? 

Why? Who knows. I'm guessing adrenaline junkie. I'm guessing there may be good therapy for that. Dunno. Before doing it again, there is a good question to ask: who needs you?",POSITIVE
"Aug 22, 2018","There isn't much left to say about ""Mission Impossible: Fallout."" While overall it's not quite as great of a film as you've heard, it rates an A+ when it comes to rousing action. The practical stunts are hair-raising, and it's far and away the best film in the franchise. You likely do not need any convincing to go see this blockbuster, but I will encourage you to head to the theaters immediately to watch this on the biggest screen possible.

It's frantic and fun, setting the bar high for mainstream action films. Featuring what are arguably some of the best action sequences in modern cinema history, the movie is also dazzling to look at with its grand scale cinematography. When the clock starts ticking, there's a thrilling sense of real danger - especially when Tom Cruise himself is dangling from a helicopter. It's a visual stunner that isn't burdened with flashy CGI effects, which in itself is refreshing.

Cruise, who famously does most of his own stunts, shows that he's never too old to be a credible action hero. His Ethan Hunt is flawed, but that only serves to make him more relatable to the rest of us. He's one of America's last true movie stars, and he outdoes himself here. The likable supporting players (Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames) are sadly still playing second fiddle, with the exception of Henry Cavill as a tagalong CIA suit.

A perfect film it's not, but it's awfully easy to overlook the problems (a textbook story, the draggy length, some nonsensical plot holes, Alec Baldwin's distracting and shouty non-performance) because this movie is all about one thing: the thrilling action scenes. There are so many that are so well done it becomes impossible to choose a favorite, although I could watch the motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris and the bloody bathroom fistfight scenes once a week and never tire of the artistry in the stunt work.

And that's what audiences will flock to see. The plot doesn't really play a significant factor in the creative (if mostly unbelievable) story, and its twists grow from ""wow, that's cool"" to ridiculous eye-rolling whoppers. No true lover of action films will care, because my review of this movie could easily be nothing more than two words: ""buckle up.""

"Aug 18, 2018","For the first time in the history of this franchise, previous installment helmer Christopher McQuarrie returns to bring us a direct sequel to his critically acclaimed hit 'Rogue Nation'. And yet if you didn't know it, you wouldn't initially think that because he has adapted a very different style for this follow-up and in the process has created one of the best action movies ever made.

Fallout is by far the series best (and yes, I realise we say this almost every time a new installment rolls into theaters) but McQuarrie/Cruise and co. really outdid themselves this time around with stunts that many filmmakers will try to match in the coming years.

The story might seem complex on the surface, but once you deconstruct it to its core it is nothing more than a straight-up revenge story and it delivers a strong enough narrative to keep the film going.

It is the action that is front and center here, and for good reason.
Chris McQuarrie, Rob Hardy (DP) and Eddie Hamilton (Editor) is a dream team functioning in the highest gear. With Hardy capturing some spectacular wide-shots and Hamilton/McQuarrie cutting sequences together in such a way that they don't become exhausting but remain exhilarating all the way through.

As for Cruise, he is great and believable as always, but if you're looking for a deep character study, this isn't the film for you.

To sum it up: I can see some people getting turned off by the story but other than that there is no excuse not to see this film.",POSITIVE

"Aug 18, 2018",Honestly felt terrified for some of the characters. The action scenes felt real and intense. There was a human aspect to the characters that persisted even when they were up against impossible trials. It had my attention until the very end,POSITIVE
"Aug 18, 2018","The action sequences in this movie are really good, I admit it.  But the actual storytelling is flimsy because it's all cardboard cutouts.  Taking a cue from the narrative structure of video games, the movie shifts abruptly from chase scene to chase scene, broken up by short bursts of pure exposition (thank goodness for these committee meetings!).  The characters are one-dimensional caricatures, and the plot is driven by a series of arbitrary situations, predictably explained and then solved by our hero.  The situations, twists, and solutions are equally out of the blue and ridiculous.  The reveals in the larger plot are sadly circular and self-referential - it turns out that office politics, petty revenge, and incompetence are the main motivators.  I had some hopes for this movie because the trailer seemed to be playing up a lot of stumbles by Ethan Hunt, but that feeling didn't make it into the movie; instead he is a demi-god that can literally do any physical, mental, or skill-based task better than anyone...and that's pretty boring.  But those action sequences are cool!",NEGATIVE

Probably one of the best movies I've seen in 2018, Mission: Impossible - Fallout was full of action and twists. I also want to add that the actors in this movie were phenomenal. The plot was simply great, my heart was pounding throughout the entire movie. I would have to say my favorite thing about Mission: Impossible - Fallout was that even though it was a fast-paced, action film, there were parts in the movie that were funny and that's how I know it is a really good movie- that there can be a good balance of comedy, drama, and action. I definitely recommend seeing Mission: Impossible - Fallout!",POSITIVE

"Aug 17, 2018","One of the few action franchises that seems to have gotten better with age. Great action scenes, a serviceable plot line that keeps you engaged if not enthralled and entertaining side characters to distract from the fact that Ethan Hunt has the personality of a wooden plank with eyes drawn on it. It's doubtful I'll remember the finer points of the plot a few weeks from now, but the action set pieces are all incredible cinematic moments. Personally, the bathroom fight is my favorite. See this thing on the biggest screen you can.",POSITIVE
"Aug 17, 2018","In my opinion all the movies in the saga ""mission: impossible"" this is the best, my favorite ... It remembers the old 007 as it is full of twists, action, adventure, comedy and drama. Christopher McQuarrie is incredible, the only director who has worked more than once in the M:i series. Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill are spectacular. Watch it!!!!",POSITIVE

"Aug 17, 2018","First of all, we can appreciate the great work of very recognized actors like Tom Cruise, Henry Calville, Simon pegg, among others. This actors really make you feel what the script is suppose to make feel to the watching  public. I really appreciate actors that live their characters between their bones. 

However, the story has the same plot and actually, also, the same resolution as the previous Mission Impossible movies. But, on the same side, we can say that this series of movies distinguish themselves because of the sequenced plot and resolution, in which the ""good one's"" always win the fight, or in this case, the misison. 

Also I was amazed by the special effects and training of the actors, which made feel like I was on the movie. It has great image's resolution, and also it has this soundeffects that really creates an intense feeling.

In conclusion, I give 5 stars to this movie, because of the enjoyable moment it made me experience. And well, because of all that was mentioned previously. I really recommend it.",POSITIVE

"Aug 17, 2018","Another solid installment of a classic action franchise.

"Aug 15, 2018","Not since the 1988 revival of the TV series has Mission Impossible shown its age.  The MI movies have been going at it for 22 years now-so long, in fact, that Metallica's infamous Napster lawsuit, which is forever tied to this franchise, is nearing its 20th anniversary.  Today, Tom Cruise & Ving Rhames are getting old.  Like, Roger Moore in A View to a Kill old.  It seems like the franchise might need to be revamped with a younger face once again sooner or later.  But if that were the case, then Fallout would be a pretty high note to go out on.

Mission Impossible 6 is one of the grittiest movies in the franchise, comparable to JJ Abrams' MI-3.  For a film series noted for its fast-paced action sequences, this one is one of the slowest as well-it puts more emphasis on the espionage and the trickery rather than the wall-to-wall action, like in other installments.  Nevertheless, there is enough intrigue going about to keep the audience gripped the whole time, plus some very interesting and unexpected twists and turns in the plot.  Not to mention that there is a ""quality over quantity"" approach to its action sequences, which make for the action sequences that do happen being true jaw-droppers to behold.

Remember Ilsa Faust and the villainous Lane from the last movie?  They're back in this one, and arguably, their arcs in this one are even better than last time.  For once, we get a greater depth into Lane's character, and Ilsa has arguably the most fascinating character arc in this picture.  And then there's the other real scene-stealer: Henry Cavill as the mysterious August Walker.  Even though you can see where is arc is going at hindsight, HC executes it in a way that makes you want to see him do it.  I can't spoil much about his character, but it does take a fascinating turn.

However, I can say this: Henry Cavill is rocking one of the sickest beards to ever grace the movie screen.  Seriously!  The next time you go to a showing of this movie, wait for the moment Henry Cavill graces the screen for the first time, and listen closely.  You could hear at least one fangirl shrieking in the theater at the mere sight of Cavill's manly mustache, combined with that neat suit that he's wearing.  He's a chick magnet of the Draco in Leather Pants variety (see TV Tropes for what that means), the kind of bad boy that'll make fangirls in the audience lose their minds when they gaze their eyes upon him.  His beard is so cool, in fact, that DC Entertainment could only shave his face with CGI for Justice League.  That's how fucking manly he looks!

Then there's the climax-one of the tensest and most breathtaking climaxes in this whole series.  Never have stakes so grave been set in such a unique locale for the finale on a scale that seems so small yet actually so great.  Only one facet of this climax features grand spectacle, but the other half is literally a grungy gut-punch.  For a PG-13 flick, half of the final fight got quite dark at times, which only made the tension even higher.  It is the kind of rewarding finale that punctuates Mission Impossible 6's continuation of the franchise's hot streak after all this time.

Final verdict:
Is Mission Impossible 6 great?  FUCK YEAH!",POSITIVE
"Aug 14, 2018",Garbage. Scientology has to be the reason behind good reviews of this trite. I do not understand how this movie gets a pass. Overly complicated garbage plot line (which is also somehow predictable) with 20-30 min segments that could just be removed and have zero bearing on the movie. ,NEGATIVE

"Aug 14, 2018","This is the best Mission Impossible movie yet. I came for great stunts and good fight scenes and slight intrigue. I was not let down. Henry Cavill is a brilliant villain.

"Aug 14, 2018","Absolutely incredible from beginning to end and possibly the best Mission Impossible film to date! A lot of incredible action sequences that are even more impressive knowing that Cruise is doing most of his own stunts.

MI6 is a blueprint on how to do an action movie right.",POSITIVE

"Aug 11, 2018","Not sure why this got a good score, but this was not that good compared to the last 2 mission impossibles. First of all, what idiot  editor decided to put clips of the movie in the title sequence. It basically shows all the scenes from the movie. I don't want to see that shit at all. They also did that in Rogue Nation. The editor should be fired from his job for that. No more of that in the next one. Tom Cruise still does his usual stunts and stuff but compared to Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation, they are downplayed. Nothing tops the Dubai scene in Ghost or the Underwater scene in Rogue. The plot takes you on lots of betrayal and not knowing who to trust. They did the same thing like in Xmen Origins where they rescue some guy and then ends up not worth it at all because he goes rogue. The ending is very predictable and you know exactly what is going to happen. And the 1 on 1 battle at the end just used mostly CG and was crap compared to the finale from Mission Impossible 2. MI6 is just not that good and nothing sticks out to watch it again. The next one better be better than this.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 11, 2018","How anyone could give this insulting mess a positive review is beyond me. It is unrelentingly stupid without a trace of believability anywhere in site. I love ridiculous action movies, but this was exhausting. Everything is as extreme and down to the wire as possible. If there's a crash, you'd better believe the wreckage is going to teeter on the edge. If there's a time limit, they'll succeed at one second left, just like always.
I was fully bamboozled by all the positive hype, despite my better instincts. This series has gone full Fast & Furious on us.  Ridiculous, constantly over the top action that makes very little sense, drama that's meaningless since no one ever gets hurt or dies, and a shoehorned in love story that no one remembers (this series had been going on for 22 years!)  or cares about.
I was legitimately happy when the movie ended.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 10, 2018","The perfect Action film. That one summer blockbuster that manages to get you invested in the huge character roster in this big franchise, while also doing amazing stunts that, instead of just being there to show how capable the cast is, genuinely pushes the plot forward and just makes you even more interested, which has been a problem with past entries for me (doing stunts for the sake of doing it). Experienced actors like Sean Harris, Ving Rhames, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin show even more diversity in these roles here, with Harris being a favorite of mine playing the intimidating, endlessly evil Solomon Lane, but every other actor is also very good, adding more humanizing qualities to their characters (Tom Cruise and Ferguson do an especially good job here). Although Lane is as wicked as ever, the other villain ""Lark"", whose real identity you probably won't be shocked to see, manages to be a surprisingly sympathetic villain when you truly understand his motives, you might even agree with him somewhat. Excellent, never has an action film had such interesting characters or in general been this good since 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road. Go watch this film NOW.",POSITIVE

Saying the action sequences in this are phenomenal is understating it. There are fight and chase scenes in this that blew me away. 
Sure, the story wasn¬ít really anything new, but the characters are great and the delivery of some twists, as these films will have, are well done. 
This is 2 1/2 hours and I could¬íve watched more. This has set the bar for any future, not just spy, but all action movies. I will watch this again, but in IMAX.

"Aug 9, 2018","Was this one of those movies where critics were paid off to post a bunch of awesome reviews?  They had my hopes up high.  But after seeing the movie, the tomato scores don't make sense.  Relative to other action movies this movie was decent.  Relative to other MI movies, this was probably my least favorite. It had several really good action scenes - overall the action was really good.  But the plot and story of this one - it was too complicated, it was not compelling.  I knew from the (spoiler) start, when there wasn't a good opening sequence, that something was off.  The opening sequence was slow and was just setting up the story.  Also, the cast felt a little tired because the story was lacking.  Rebecca Ferguson was used to great effect in the last MI installment.  This story tried to use her in the same way but it was not as interesting, repetitive.  Simon Pegg is excellent in everything he does, but he and Ving Rhames are becoming sort of flat characters in the franchise. I think new supporting characters would be more interesting.  Henry Cavill was a great casting choice and he was decent character but the story wasn't up to par for his character.  And in general, the motivations of the antagonists were really hard to relate to.  I hope they make more MI's but maybe do a bit of a reboot, or find a really dynamic and new story.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 9, 2018","This was the first time I have seen a Mission Impossible movie.  I really enjoyed it though.  I would like to go back and watch the others now.  The story was kind of cheesy at times, but the stunts and action way made up for that.",POSITIVE

"Aug 9, 2018","The vast majority of movie franchises suffer from diminishing returns. This Tom Cruise-led action series has avoided that common downturn by turning in ridiculously ambitious, consistently fresh and eminently exhilarating thrill rides. The sixth M:I entry, Fallout also boasts some firsts: first time a director has returned, first time the story has been directly influenced by the previous instalment, and first time a femme fatale has come back to seduce/endanger our protagonist. A big part of the franchise's success has been the revolving door of directors at the helm, each bringing their own visual style and filmmaking priorities, so it's interesting to see how Christopher McQuarrie attacks his second impossible mission behind the camera. Not surprisingly, seeing as McQuarrie has always been a more blunt-force kind of action filmmaker, this sequel is arguably the most bruising and intense. Which is no small feat for a series that has prided itself on its physical demanding set pieces. There are no less than four sequences that are genuinely jaw-dropping in their execution, featuring crunching hand-to-hand combat, an invigorating car/motorbike pursuit, an adrenaline-pumping roof-top chase on foot, and a ballsy helicopters-playing-chicken sequence beginning with an unbelievable stunt. Love him or hate him offscreen, it's getting harder to argue that Cruise isn't one of the finest showmen working in Hollywood today. His dedication to performing some of the craziest stunts committed to celluloid is admirable and, quite simply, amazing considering his age. But it wouldn't be the hugely entertaining film it is if everyone wasn't firing on all cylinders; from the pitch-perfect supporting cast (Simon Pegg's comedic sidekick, Rebecca Ferguson's MI6 agent, Henry Cavill's undiplomatic CIA henchman) to the behind the scenes crew. In fact composer Lorne Balfe deserves special mention for his left-of-field score, the use of low, haunting orchestral tunes (including a fantastic rendition of the classic M:I theme) during select sequences is a masterstroke in imbuing the movie with a certain gravitas. With everyone at the top of their game, headlined by another fervent Cruise performance, Fallout is extremely high-calibre action cinema that will feature predominantly on end-of-year 'best' lists.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2018",Henry Cavil was born for action movies ! its really cool movies which i have watched using boxxy software,POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2018","I‚Äôm probably going against the fandom but I was really bored. Liked 2, 5, 1 and 4 better (yes the order is ranked by my preference). This much like 3 had too many shots of Tom Cruise senselessly running for my taste.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 6, 2018","Non-stop action, typical MI movie",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018","Repetitive pointless action filmed solely for entertainment while forgetting to have an actual coherent plot. Every scene happened just to happen. Ethan Hunt's ego is too big and they over do the whole ""he's clearly the best guy on earth wow so wholesome so good so moral."" The bad guy could not have been more obvious since they give it away wayyyyy too early in the movie. The white widow acted clueless, dumb, and was overall just another pretty face to look at. Every action scene was beautifully choreographed and wonderfully filmed but was so impractical and littered with so many glaring flaws it took away from how cool it was supposed to be. I could go on for hours",NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2018","As an avid fan of the Mission Impossible movies I was a bit concerned about Fallout, because there are two great things that set this franchise apart from all the others, and they ignored both this time. First of all, they have done a good job of hiring a different director for every single film, which means they each have their own unique feel. This movie was carrying over Christopher McQuarrie to take a second consecutive shot at directing. I didn‚Äôt have any issues with his direction of Rogue Nation, but I liked the variety they attained before. Secondly, all the films up to this point have been almost complete stand-alone stories. There were a few minor references to the past, but nothing that made it necessary to know the history to enjoy the next movie. Fallout is the first that directly ties into the previous films and references them a number of times. In fact, you could almost find direct connections to all 5 previous installments in this one. I‚Äôm not sure if any of this made it hard for those who aren‚Äôt fans of the franchise to follow this plot, but I found myself lapping it up. It felt stand-alone, but also connected, which is hard to pull off. At this point it seems like they need to reference the history anyways, because Tom Cruise is starting to get older, despite how it may appear on screen. This is the first time I felt they played into Cruise‚Äôs age just a little bit. He actually looks worn, weary, and fallible at certain times. This doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt kicking butt and performing some of the most insane death-defying stunts you can imagine, because there‚Äôs still plenty of that. The stunt coordinators on these films continue to astound me, as they make the action feel authentic instead of something manufactured in a machine. The bar is continually set by practical stunts, and computer animation still hasn‚Äôt caught up. That‚Äôs what makes Mission Impossible the gold standard when it comes to action. The story here is a little convoluted, but considering the amount of double-crossing and mistaken identity that happens in these films it is par for the course. I did find myself predicting some of the twists and turns only because I‚Äôve trained myself to expect some level of deception at any moment. The way they build tension into the story is perfect, and even when I mentally know the hero can‚Äôt possibly die in an early scene, I still feel some level of concern that the movie might surprise me. The cast is all great in Fallout, including the newcomer Henry Cavill. I‚Äôm such an avid fan of this franchise that I wish they would start grooming the next generation star who has an insane taste for risking his/her life to replace Tom Cruise. We‚Äôll see if it ever gets to that point, but for now, I‚Äôm still enjoying the adventures, and I‚Äôm astounded that at this point it seems Mission Impossible has found a way to completely steal the spy film spotlight from James Bond.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018",The greatest action movie I've ever seen! Unbelievable!,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018",Lots of action. Non-stop fun.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018","movie was really good, hennery cavil played his part so well. movie is definitely worth watching if you your like a hard hitting action movie.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018","Mission: Impossible - Fallout (the 6th movie of the ongoing movie series) is a great example of what an action movie should be. Tom Cruise once again impresses fans across the globe, by doing every stunt by himself without the help of a 'stunt double'. Other cast members such as Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris and Alec Baldwin are very good at playing their roles aswell. For me personally, I find this film the absolute best of the famous M:I collection. The action never slows down, and speaking of action - that bathroom fight scene was epic in so many ways. Props to the director/whoever helped to make Fallout, because I have now declared it to be my favourite movie of 2018 (so far) with Avengers: Infinity War being second. Can't wait to see what's planned for the future!",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018",Another great action movie addition to the series. One of my favorite movie series is this series.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018","Have the movie people paid off the guys at rotten tomatoes.   Its star wars all over again.    Very predictable, actually boring.    Acting was poor all round.     Seemed rushed through somehow.    Worst one I've seen hands down.    Not as bad as star wars reharshed rubbish.   Very poor wish I hadn't gone to cinema to see it , could have waited for DVD.     Why did it get that rating.    So seriously this movie stands up to the likes of usual suspects,  Jason bourne etc.   No.   First Jack Reacher movie is better.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 6, 2018","Great action, cinematography and sound effects. However the story and acting felt quite weak in my opinion.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 6, 2018","Horrible just plain horrible. In an age where spy movies and hero movies are consistently coming out and blowing away previous films, Fallout was a snoozefest. The plot - if it can be called that - is so weak and tiresome that within the first ten minutes anyone with a brain can determine how it will end. I know Tom Cruise supposedly did his own stunts but the how and why aren't actually feasible in real life. I know I know it's not supposed to be real but some semblance of plausibility would have been nice. Don't waste your money wait til it comes out in dvd or on a streaming site. Just not worth it.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2018","This movie was one of the finest action movies I have ever seen. It‚Äôs that simple. Being a fan of action films such as the Bourne series, the Bond series, and especially the mission series, this film holds up as one of the best. Tom Cruise is simply on another level with work ethic that you do not see anymore. He learned to fly a freaking helicopter for a chase sequence, he jumped out of a plane at 25000 feet, and also broke his ankle performing a jump. He is nuts! The film if you follow the series picks up as a continuation of the 5th film as most of the characters return with the exception of Renner. The plot was deep felt no matter how silly some of the sequences got. We really see some tight relationships on the screen that does had some heart to the film. The film never ever let up, and had sequences that rank up there with the dubai scene. I also want to say Henry Cavill exceeded expectations here. He was fantastic and very believable. He also kicked major tail. This movie is the ULTIMATE popcorn fun with an edge to it. Its what Michael Bay wishes he could be. At the end of the day Cruise is what ties the film together. His bold presence, his stunt work and dedication to the role puts the bow on the box. A near perfect action film that could be one of the genres best in some time.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018","Deliriously entertaining set pieces meet taut and subtle, smaller exchanges - Cram it all together and you get perhaps the most technically well crafted action thriller since Mad Max: Fury Road.   MI Fallout proves that the series is as strong as ever.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018",Lots of action although it tests the limits of believability. Great stunts but the plot twists were very predictable and the dialogue is lacking. The male costar Henry Cahill is awful. His lines are completely stiff and have seen better acting in community theater. Fun movie but I wouldn't pay full price to see it.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2018","Acting was subpar (Baldwin and Cruise sounded flat & as though they were reading a teleprompter half the time!) & writing was trite &  terrible. Laughed through half this movie. And yes, Cruise runs (again).... this time at about a CG-enhanced warp speed!",NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2018","This or Rogue Nation, I can't decide which I like better! Oh darn. Guess I have to watch them again. This may just be the finest Mission yet.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018",A unoriginal plot is spiced up by fun and energetic action sequences. The acting is top notch and Tom Cruise is again superb as Ethan Hunt. Worth seeing this one in theaters just for the car chase in Paris.,POSITIVE

Rating: A

""Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the best film of its franchise and one of the best action movies of all-time, regarding the execution of said action set pieces.¬†Tom Cruise proves that he is an icon if not the biggest icon in action film history, through dozens of runs, jumps and God knows what more. McQuarrie brings his fantastic technical attributes to this movie and uses an¬†exceptional cast to interpret remarkable characters. A simple yet captivating plot supports the excellent action, and it still carries a few (predictable) twists. Only a few nit-picky things forbid me from giving this film an¬†A+, but I promise you, it will definitely be in my Top10 by the end of the year. Go see it! On IMAX! NOW!""",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018",every thing about this movie is brilliant absolutely beautiful brilliant. take a half star off because it's cliche spy movie storyline. ,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018","An action roller coaster, better put your seatbelt on for this one.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018","Mission Impossible did the impossible with one of the best films of the franchise. In typical MI fashion, the plot guides you in one direction, then hits you with a hard turn. The adventure is complemented with corny jokes provided by Cruise and Pegg. For what few shortcomings the movie did have, the cinematography was enough to distract you. Not a movie that required you to watch the 5 prequels, so my suggestions is to take the time and see it on the big screen.",POSITIVE

"Aug 5, 2018","Cruise Control

In his one man war against CGI, TC becomes Ethan Hunt again and proceeds to do the impossible. The actor is 56, and struggles not to look it, especially against the females who love him (tow, of course) are 20 years younger. But he persists to do truly ridiculous stunts, breaking his ankle in the process, all for our entertainment.

This one is so formulaic as to be laughable. Plot armoured to the tips of his spikes hair, Cruise and his buddies defuse the excitement, as their is no danger of death. All of the huffing and puffing around the absurd, turbo fuelled action count for naught in this Tom and Jerry cartoon. It is worse than a 1970's Jame Bond with the raging Roger Moore. Sure its fun, great eye candy.  But it is too easy for Hunt to work out how to win.'I'll figure it out' he responds to every absurd situation. And of course he does. He read the script. He knows he will win.

Yes it is enjoyable despite all the silliness. You can't keep your eyes off of it. Simon Pegg and Ving Rames are again along for the ride, and Cruise uses the same writer/director. It's Tom's film, all the way - everyone else is a prop to his human Superman, and the dialogue reflects his centrality, especially in the last, cloying scenes. The world needs Tom Cruise to ensure us that, in the end, all will be well.

MI6 is pure Cruise control.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 4, 2018","It is staggering to see that these Mission: Impossible flicks actually seem to keep getting better. On the surface, this sixth entry in its high-octane, fast-paced, yet patiently-conceived, thrill-fest of a franchise is a rocket launcher with enough firepower to skyrocket any action junkie into divine explosive sensations of adrenalized intoxication. However, this astronomical energy is further complimented by a rich dosage of both character value and transparency. This movie manages, in an admirable fashion, to project the weight of the struggles, emotions, decisions, and consequences of its characters in a manner that feels genuinely substantial and even palpable to the audience -- a very rare feat to such extent in an action blockbuster. Here, the filmmakers want these characters to be understood as people instead of just being applauded for looking cool, and the distinct effectiveness of these efforts is solidified through three main aspects: 1) the ultimate threat against humanity in the film, the sheer scope of destruction and terror infused in it, is heavily based in reality to where the uprising of a similar danger in our modern society is entirely believable; 2) the characters are individually and cohesively motivated to save people simply for the sakes of humanity and their loved ones rather than be coerced by a stereotypical call-to-arms scenario (revenge, rescuing the damsel in distress, etc.); and 3) the movie quickly and clearly establishes that failure is a definite possibility, presenting a whole new, fully-loaded tension tablet for the audience to swallow. In short, the movie honorably convinces its audience that there are deeper reasons to care for these characters and the outcomes of their missions......which is more than can be said for most movies of a similar caliber. Movies like this are noteworthy and prove that action blockbusters can be much more than fluffy, explosive, popcorn, summer money-makers.",POSITIVE
"Aug 4, 2018","At some point Tom Cruise is riding the same bike I have and he crashes. That made me very sad (fist to heart, peace sign to sky). Other than that, this is as good as action movies can get, perfect in IMAX. This franchise is the only one that never disappoints and by now they got the formula to a T: great cast, awesome action sequences, fantastic pacing and they're pushing the limits of impossible (haha I so funny) situations just enough that we stand at the edge of suspension of disbelief without falling over.",POSITIVE

"Aug 4, 2018","Mission: Impossible- Fallout Review: Fallout is the newest movie in the Mission: Impossible series. The last two movies have been the best of the franchise yet, but this one is the best yet. The plot was so good. It kept you on edge and it was very engaging. Tom Cruise was once again good as Ethan. Henry Cavill was my favorite part of the movie. He did such a good job. The action sequences are some of the best that I‚Äôve seen in a movie in quite a while. They were so thrilling. So much happened in the film that sometimes it was jut a little too much at times but still it was good. The final act was probably the best part of the movie. The score was pretty good compared the previous films. The only problem I had was that it was just a little too long.

"Aug 4, 2018","Mission Impossible: Fallout is another excellent entry into one of the best action franchises still making movies today; it's truly amazing a 6th film could be this good. 
Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt once more and kicks ass once more as well. The stunts he performs are astounding, he continues to do ridiculous things for our entertainment. Cruise knows his character like the back of his hand, he plays the IMF agent so effortlessly; there simply isn't anyone else better to be the star of your movie in this blockbuster-driven world. The rest of the cast is also awesome with many returning names such as Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin, Rebecca Ferguson, and Sean Harris as the infamous Solomon Lane. Meanwhile new names Henry Cavill and Angela Bassett slide in perfectly to the franchise. 
There are so many positive things to say about this movie. The plot kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, I could never predict what would happen next, I never knew who to trust; there were always twists and turns around the corner. The set-pieces are as crazy and thrilling as ever, this movie is action at its finest. Want a great fight scene? Or what about a shootout? Or a car chase? Or even better, a helicopter chase? In every aspect this movie delivers. The villains are strong and can hold their own; Solomon Lane, while in a more reserved role, is still as menacing as ever. While the ""stop the nuclear weapons from going off"" plot isn't wholly original, the movie is able to keep it fresh through adding its own sophistication and nuance to it. I really liked Ghost Protocol, so I have trouble saying this is the best of the franchise, but regardless, this is a great action movie. 
Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to make sure you see this movie in theaters because I know I may have to see this one a second time it was so awesome.",POSITIVE

"Aug 4, 2018","If you've seen the last 3 Christopher Nolan movies and Skyfall then you've seen shot-for-shot all of the first hour of the movie to the point where it becomes fantastically boring, this section is also not helped by Tom Cruise and Henry Cavil'ls flat and fairly uninterested performances which are very prevalent throughout. The second hour is when the film actually starts to move into something original and this is where it begins to shine. So my recommendation is to show up to this movie an hour late then you'll get an all around fun action movie experience. It doesn't deserve the 98%, it won't change your life, the ending action scenes elevate what will ultimately be a forgettable movie. I give it a 55%.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 4, 2018","Tom, please forgive me for doubting the value of your skills in keeping this series alive.  I loved it.   How does anyone NOT love this movie!?    Action, twists, intensity....I keep thinking that chase scenes can't be improved on....boy am I wrong.   Love the cast, and the plot.   Characters are so engrossing and fun.    See this one now!",POSITIVE
"Aug 4, 2018","As much fun as the other outings, Tom Cruise and crew deliver another impossible mission.
Don't expect to see any tense moments of infiltration like the other movies, though. This is an action movie.

"Aug 4, 2018","July 27, 2018

Benji: ""How close were we?""

Ethan: ""The usual.""

Benji: ""Huh. The usual.""

This isn't just the second to last dialogue exchange in ""Mission: Impossible: Fallout""; it's also a summary of the preceding two and a half hours. If ever there was a typical ""Mission: Impossible"" movie-the template of which was forged nearly a quarter century ago-this is it. ""Fallout,"" much like ""Rogue Nation"" before it, seems determined to stay completely inside the lines set and maintained by its fellow ""Mission"" brethren, as well as other spy-action movies. In fact, of ""Rogue Nation,"" I had written: ""...the movie left me feeling cautious and uncertain about future 'M:I' installments...Cruise and the filmmakers seem willing to water down and re-use the plots on which the action and stunts hang. I'm not sure how long this approach can go on."" Unfortunately, ""Fallout"" confirms to me it cannot go on any longer, or at least it shouldn't (I'm sure the movie will still be a huge financial success), and it's the first ""Mission"" movie I can't justifiably recommend.

It tears me up inside to write such words, because as a series of technical exercises and highly elaborate stunt sequences, ""Fallout"" is stupendous and exceptional, and often the best of its kind. On paper, its ambitions as a spy thriller, at least as far as spectacle, should have yielded quite the mesmerizing movie-going experience. But oddly enough, as a movie doesn't feel experiential. It plays as more of a model that future second unit directors, stunt coordinators, and editors might study in order learn how to seamlessly execute action sequences of the highest caliber and complexity. From an academic point of view, I would recommend it hands down, but from a narrative one, I needed more than just the standard ""Mission"" plot to engage me.

Speaking of the plot, if the film's closing dialogue summed it up as ""the usual,"" then the opening scene, in not so explicit of words, essentially promises the same thing. During the trademark, ""This is your mission, should you choose to accept it"" encrypted recording, spy/agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) receives word that members of the terrorist organization known as the Syndicate, led by the now-captured but still very dangerous Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) and which Hunt sought to prove the existence of in ""Rogue Nation,"" have recently resurfaced and formed a new faction called The Apostles. They are partnering with a faceless zealot named John Lark, who has written a manifesto that outlines a fanatical plan to wipe the Earth clean of corruption and sin in order to begin it anew. It's your typical megalomaniacal scheme, which will begin with Lark contaminating enough of the world's water supply to eliminate one-third of the planet's population.

To carry out this annihilation, Lark has tasked the Apostles with acquiring three plutonium cores, which he'll use to make a nuclear bomb that will detonate atop the mountains surrounding Pakistan, India and China. That is, unless Hunt and his trusted Impossible Mission Force (IMF) team-Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg)-can intercept the cores first. And indeed they have the chance, but during a tense exchange at the beginning of the film, Hunt must choose between obtaining the cores and saving a member of his own team's life, and in the end, his teammate wins out, leaving the cores, as they say, ""in the wind.""

So what was once a seemingly straightforward mission becomes, yet again, a most complicated operation that takes Hunt and his cohorts all over the world, from Belfast to Paris to London, and eventually Kashmir, as they attempt to retrieve the plutonium and prevent three nuclear bombs from going off. And if you think things won't boil down to the last possible millisecond, complete with a red digital readout, then you're obviously not familiar with ""the usual"" ""Mission"" devices.

Usual or not, one of the elements that has always kept the ""Mission"" movies grounded is the humanity and likability of the characters, and both of those are in full swing here, despite the absurdity of the plot. In fact, it's Hunt's decision to spare one human life at the potential cost of millions that IMF Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin, now so hard to imagine not as Donald Trump) finds so admirable about him. The same cannot be said of CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett), who doesn't trust the IMF and insists her own agent, Augustus Walker (Henry Cavill), accompany Hunt when he must parachute from high above Paris to meet the mysterious White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) at the Grand Palais. She's supposedly the broker between John Lark and the Apostles, but one of the running themes throughout the ""M:I"" movies is that, aside from the good guys, nobody really is who they say are. The reveal of each character's actual identity and loyalty is so common a ploy in this series that it's fairly easy to guess who will come out either as a savior or as a double-crosser, and the fact that it is so easy now dilutes some of the fun.

Still, the movie does have a consistent momentum, and to writer-director Christopher McQuarrie's credit (he's the only filmmaker to helm two ""Mission"" movies following ""Rogue Nation""), he doesn't dumb things down, and the standard labyrinthine plot set by the original ""Mission"" continues here. But again, because such a quality has become so routine, it simply doesn't render the same effect it once did. Because we anticipate the narrative being overstuffed and convoluted, ""Fallout"" merely meets our expectations instead of going beyond them. 

The same goes for the otherwise incredible stunts and action sequences, which range from the aforementioned skydive; an intense martial arts fight in a night club men's room; a motorcycle/car chase on the narrow streets of Paris; a full-throttle run across the rooftops of London; and a superior dual helicopter battle over snow-capped mountains. Each of these is executed with great vigor, detail, and conviction, and had they been the first of their kind, ""Mission: Impossible: Fallout"" might have been one of the most memorable action movies in recent memory. However, as extreme, sensational and uncompromising as these sequences are, the fact remains they are not original, but simply performed to a greater degree than what we've seen before. The movie essentially takes what other action movies (including previous ""M:I"" movies) have done and pumped them full of steroids, and I needed it do more than just beef things up.

To give you an idea, the bathroom fight, right down to the lighting design, feels like it was yanked right out of ""True Lies,"" while the Paris chase mirrors a similar sequence in ""The Bourne Identity."" Meanwhile, as Hunt sprints across a series of roofs in London, I couldn't help but recall him sprinting at the end of ""M:I:III"" in much the same way.

So unfortunately, the film's ""usualness"" (both with regard to its plot and its action), ends up costing it too much excitement value. Don't get me wrong-I fully recognize the filmmakers' technical prowess, as well as Cruise and company's ceaseless and enthusiastic dedication, but the hackneyed material ultimately undermines them and I left the theater feeling mostly underwhelmed.

Still, even though ""Fallout"" didn't marvel me like I hoped, it did leave me hopeful, because I'm confident this same team of filmmakers and actors can apply their energy and resources to fresher, more worthy material. This should be their mission going forward, so let's hope they choose to accept it.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 4, 2018","As most people out there already know, I love my movies and am always champing at the bit to check out the latest blockbuster.

Tonight was no exception, as we cruised in to the ACE Cinemas to view the latest instalment in the Mission Impossible franchise.

This version was like a multi-faceted diamond where each facet shined boldly beyond belief.

The first aspect that was worthy of mention was the return the very cool cast, in Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg playing the parts of legendary Ethan Hunt, Luther Stickell and Benji Dunn.

Also returning was the potential love interest for Ethan in Rebecca Ferguson as Lisa.

The producers also enlisted the services of the latest screen Superman, Henry Cavill. He did a great job in adding some machismo manliness so as to try and rival Ethan's alpha dominance.

Alec Baldwin is always a welcomed addition to any cast and was convincing as Ethan's boss, albeit in somewhat of a cameo appearance.

The second facet that shone was the plot. Which this time around involved a terrorist by the name of Solomon Lane, who with a bunch of his so-called 'Apostles', was trying to acquire enough Plutonium to create a nuclear catastrophe that would bring civilisation to its knees. His philosophy was that ""peace on Earth cannot truly be achieved without great suffering first""! There were the usual twists and turns we've come to expect in MI flicks as well as the par for the course backstabbing, double-crossing and even triple-crossing that spy stories seem to thrive on. The only problem with this is that in the past the MI stories have been somewhat confusing and with that a tad frustrating. The confusion on this occasion was there, but thankfully nowhere near as bad.

The third facet of these movies that never fails to disappoint is the intense action that has you on the edge of your seat from go to woe. And with that, I take my hat off to fifty-something year old Sir Thomas Cruise, for defying father-time with more of his amazing stunts and cleverly coordinated fight scenes. Whatever his Endocrinologist has prescribed for him, I want me some of that!!!

The frantic facet of this film which was fantastic were the superb chase scenes that involved motorbikes, cars, trucks, helicopters and of course that inimitable running technique of Tom's, where you swear he's going to do himself an injury with the way those pointed fingers go perilously close to his eye sockets as his arms go up and down like human pistons!!

As a fan of BMW automobiles, it was also nice to see them clearly sponsoring Mission Impossible with some of their magnificent M-Series vehicles, R nine T Scrambler motorcycles and my favourite, the classic 750iL Saloon!!

The fifth facet that for me was the most fascinating was the way the cinematographers masterfully used the art of filming iconic buildings, cultural structures, unique camera angles and majestic landscapes from around the world to enhance the whole viewing experience. This artistry was not something you would normally expect in an action blockbuster, but it was so craftily embedded that it kind of snuck up on you as the film progressed. By the end you realised that, not only were you fatigued from the all the suspense and action, but you were simultaneously super-impressed by the sheer visual splendour!

The final facet that cannot be understated is the marvellous music that we've all loved since the iconic TV series started back in the late 1960's. The musical directors have obviously tweaked it slightly with some clever remixes, but it was nice to hear some of the original theme music too.

In closing, all I can say is...

""Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to get your ass into the cinemas to watch this spectacle, before it self-destructs and heads off to DVD!!!""

"Aug 4, 2018","Less compelling than an episode of Scooby-Doo, this was easily the least satisfying of the franchise, suffering from clunky, unfocused direction and a strange performance from an otherwise reliable Tom Cruise that made his character Ethan Hunt into a weak bumbling fool.  Stunt work was stiffly choreographed, visual effects were passable, but obvious.  The script was silly, predictable and flat, and the whole thing seemed  phoned in by everyone involved.  A low water mark for Cruise, who is capable of much better work, and a waste of an otherwise talented cast.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 3, 2018","Mission: Impossible is without a doubt the best action franchise in Hollywood today, and ""Fallout"" takes everything great about the series and magnifies it. Despite his age, this is easily Tom Cruise's best performance out of the six movies thus far, both as an actor as well as a stuntman. The action and thrills here best even the exhilarating ""Ghost Protocol"", and the beautiful camerawork packs as much punch as possible into every ounce of it. The film is relentlessly suspenseful, and the characters on both sides of this fight are executed amazingly by their respective actors; the story makes great use of this, too, providing some of the most emotionally intense writing since the third entry. The story does harken back to the initial film's complexity and tone, but in a way that respects the franchise while the other elements innovate it. The final product here cannot be overstated; it's the best action film since Mad Max: Fury Road, and without a doubt the definitive blockbuster of the year.",POSITIVE

"Aug 3, 2018","I'm usually at least close in alignment with Rotten Tomatoes. Not this time. I was amazed at how I felt about this after the raving reviews. It really makes me scratch my head about the validity of how user and critic reviews drive and bias our interpretations of modern media. 

Regardless, at times I was having a grand old time. Towards the end (the helicopter scene especially) I couldn't help but keep looking over at my wife to see if I was the only one who was in awe of how bad it was, always to find her rolling her eyes validating my bewilderment. There were some cute themes as well but the romantic component seemed pretty forced. All in all, I'll give it a little love with the 1.5 stars, but I can't believe how non-critical these ""critics"" are sometimes.",NEGATIVE

All the mission Impossibles still lack the subterfuge of the original, but the amazing action sequences allow us to forgive. The absurd death of the mole at the end was so ridiculous it was a bit of an anticlimax. You couldn't help but think of Wile E. Coyote on that one.

"Aug 3, 2018","In my opinion, Mission: Impossible is the single most impeccably entertaining spy franchise in history. Forget womanizing, too-cool-for-school Bond. Forget ever-changing, overly-serious Jack Ryan. Forget forgetful, mirthless Bourne. Ethan Hunt is my spy idol. And with Fallout, McQuarrie and Cruise have delivered easily their most impossible (and best) mission yet. A globe trekking, twisting-and-turning, intensely exciting sequel that continues and expands the reigning power of this unlikely blockbuster franchise.
Once again, Hunt and his crew find themselves amid a potential global disaster, on the outs with their own government and the criminal underground. What sets this one apart is its story and plot connections with the previous films. Where the others are essentially stand-alone outings, letting you jump in where you please, this one requires you to have a modicum of knowledge on Hunt and his exploits, allowing for growth in characters and stronger stakes in the villain's mysterious plots. 
As expected, there are an endless number of great reveals that beautifully unravel information only when necessary. Thanks to some stellar editing, it's predictable when it isn't important, and unpredictable when it is, making the mysteries and the marquee action scenes that much more impacting.
Honestly, God bless Tom Cruise and his lack of self-preservation. At 52, he is one of the last true action stars who sells a movie purely by putting his name on it, thanks largely to his renown for doing his own action. And with bathroom fist fights, helicopter chases, and skydiving malfunctions, what action it is. I always think this should be the last Mission with Cruise before seeing the most recent outing; by the end I just want more.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2018","The Last Movie Star.

If one were to write a biography of Tom Cruise, that would have to be the title. Over the past several decades, Hollywood has come to rely less and less on the draw of large personalities. Most blockbusters are now marketed with spectacle and imagery, not names above the title. Yet Cruise remains. Like a dogged survivor in one of his films, he's living history stalking the tall grass of change, continually proving his own industry wrong.

And, if Mission: Impossible - Fallout is any indication, he has no intention of slowing down. Not only is the movie the most action-packed of the series, it may also be the best. Mind, this doesn't mean it's a masterpiece; the bar hasn't been set especially high when it comes to depth and intelligence. But if you enjoy the franchise, particularly the last two entries, it would be a true chore to dislike this one.

The plot-always secondary in these films, always a bit too complicated for its own good-begins in Belfast. There, IMF* agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) learns of a splinter group of assassins who call themselves the 'Apostles' and have essentially become terrorists-for-hire. They're trying to get their hands on a trio of recently-stolen plutonium cores (you can guess the reason). Also involved are an anarchist named John Lark and the previous film's villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris).

After a botched exchange in Berlin, in which the plutonium is lost, Hunt and his team (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames) are tasked by IMF Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) with recovering the cores through a meeting in Paris between Lark and a black-market broker known as the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby). Still with me? Suffice to say aborted directives, double-crosses and general chaos follow the key players from Europe all the way to the edge of the Himalayas, where Hunt's past finally catches up with him.

One thing I greatly admire in movies is ambition. As evidenced by the story, Fallout holds nothing back. Whether or not it covers the most geographic ground in the franchise, it plays like the biggest entry. Whereas past missions were stop-gaps, this is a culmination. Stakes rise, secrets are revealed; lives change.

At least, on screen. Oh that such emotions extended to the audience. But, for the most part, that effect has been absent from M:I's M.O. for quite some time. Not since the third movie did the narrative forsake its glossy, stunt-riddled surface to mine genuine feeling. And M:I-3 made the least amount of money in the franchise, so it's understandable that such a personal direction would be rerouted. 

But without it, Mission: Impossible-and Fallout specifically-is destined to be the prettiest belle at a second-rate ball. For all its globe-trotting, it's only a partial experience. We see all-and are amazed-but feel little, and remember less. Each character is more caricature than human being, trading the details of life for the whims of a streamlined script. Like Marvel or The Fast and the Furious, Fallout doesn't present reality; it paraphrases it.

Some may call this nitpicking, and they wouldn't be far off. But the bar must be raised when it comes to depth, because it's already been surpassed in nearly every other aspect. Visually, Fallout is a ball of frenetic joy, a feast for the eyes. The scenery is always changing; we can imagine the cameras struggling to keep up with such a rapidly unfolding plot. 

That plot, though, can be its own worst enemy. There are only so many twists a story can stand before each one starts to mean a little less.

Thankfully, other factors maintain our attention. Lorne Balfe's score adds some taught variation to Lalo Schifrin's classic theme. And while each member of the cast does fine, Henry Caville stands out as a mysterious CIA officer. The role fits him better than Superman's tights.

But in the end, it all comes back to Cruise. He's the reason we watch, and his relentless energy fuels the entire franchise. Fallout runs Hunt through the requisite gauntlet of stunts: hanging from a helicopter above mountainous terrain; speeding through the packed streets of Paris on a motorcycle; skydiving from thirty-thousand feet. 

But more than death-defying acrobatics is the quality they signify: devotion. When an actor who has nothing left to prove consistently gives everything he's got, admiration is easy.

"Aug 1, 2018",Not my favorite Cruise's action movie (the favorite was the great The Edge of Tomorrow) but still manages to excite and thrill. Action scenes often look over the top and this part I liked the least about the movie. They could have kept it more believable hence making it more enjoyable at least for me. The movie seems to be impeccably shot and directed but I guess I'd exchange the thrills for more brutality and honesty. But that will make it a different kind of movie perhaps.,POSITIVE

Let's just thank God he has a slamming body cuz he ain't winning any acting awards soon. And Cavil shave that damn moustache off it wasnt worth all that cg to cover it. 7.5 outta 10. 7 just for Cavil's gun show pose during the restroom scene.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2018","The Mission franchise is an interesting one.  It's spanned over 20 years, has only had two actors appear in every film, has never fully embraced continuity, and has undoubtedly gone through many production issues.  Alas, it's also one of the greatest franchises because it has defied what it means to impress audience with action and it keeps getting better and better with every film.  Although admittedly, I'm not exactly sure how it can get any better from here.  I saw this movie early, and instantly felt it was one of the best action movies of all time, but I also knew I needed to see it at least one more time before I really did give it that title.  Well, I've seen the film 4 times now and each time further cemented my feelings. Everything from the Halo jump, to the middle act (which is essentially one long chase sequence), to the callbacks, to the Helicopter scene, to Henry Cavill's unnecessary but totally bada** facial hair.  Mission: Impossible Fallout is an unbelievable ride that simply never lets up.  Even in its quiet moments, it has touching dialogue that makes the action more weighted.  Even in my 4 viewings, I've never been bored, and I can't wait to see it again.  It also surprisingly had a great amount of emotional stakes, something the serious didn't really have since Mission 3.  There are a few moments with Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, and Michelle Monaghan that really hit me emotionally, and I never would have expected that from this series.  It has the best antagonist(s) since Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and maybe even better, the action is easily the most impressive in years (probably since Fury Road), and the actors have never been better.   If there's going to be another one, then take your time and do it right, because this could very well be the best conclusion possible for the series.  Thank you to Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie for making this an instant classic.

"Aug 1, 2018","So amazing!! Tom Cruise deserves all the praise and kudos for keeping his role as Ethan Hunt entertaining and relevant. He clearly is the hardest working actor in the business.His stunts were really next to impossible. I loved watching Ving Rhames get some meatier acting time compared to other Mission movies. Rebecca Ferguson is now my forever ultimate femme hero and her chemistry with Cruise was hot hot hot. Henry Cavill proved to be a worthy adversary to Cruise and Vanessa Kirby made her stand as an up and coming actress as well. I'm hoping Angela Basset, who is such a bad a**,  be given the role as the new IMF boss. Simon Pegg had me worried there for a minute, but thankfully it all worked out. Bottom line....I'm ready for the next one.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2018","So like..this was pretty much my first time seeing a Mission Impossible movie. Which is kinda crazy cause I have always been a huge fan of the spy drama since I was a little kid.So much that it is very strange when I find a spy franchise like this that has been around for so long, but hey....its fun not going to lie there. 

The biggest positive I can see on this movie was the action is freaking amazing. Every scene feels truly brutal and powerful. I love movies with this very brutal action scenes that feel very much like John Wick or Winter Solder. Every punch given feels harder and it makes the stakes feel higher than they are. And Tom Cruise only adds to that with his action also not being perfect. He isn't the perfect fighter in the film. There are scenes where he falls and gets hurt and you feel that. Moments of just real intensity that just blow you away.

Henry Cavil also plays a great yang to Tom Cruise as his really ramps up every scene he is in and heck even steals the show at certain points and I absolutely love that.He pulls off every scene he is in with great flare and a mustache to boot to go along with it. Was the mustache needed? I don;t really think so, but it was a great add on anyway. 

The movie's greatest weakness is its execution of its twist. The twist really feel forced and unneeded at times for me. More to give a big gasp over anything else. Im not going to give away the twist here, but there is a scene or rather a collection of scenes back to back when we get one twist after the other and it feels really dragging. 

Overall though Mission Impossible is a fun time at the theater and one I'd highly recommend.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2018","Everything you want from a Mission Impossible movie is present and accounted for in this sixth instalment of Tom Cruise's teflon franchise: the McGuffin plot chock full of double and triple crosses; visceral and punishing hand-to-hand combat; chase sequences in the air, by car, motorbikes, and even helicopters; the trademark Tom Cruise running (here extended for your viewing pleasure); the return of old favourites like Simon Pegg's Benji and Rebecca Fegurson's Isla Faust and the introduction of new ones like Vanessa Kirby's fun but underused White Widow (which has great potential for the next film); and of course, the impossibly elaborate and audacious mission which will always be figured out by the IMF team headed by Cruise's Ethan Hunt. However, the real Mission: Impossible is how Cruise and returning writer-director Christopher McQuarrie manages to avoid staleness and repetition in an ageing franchise and not only manage to mount a series of spectacular and expectations-defying action sequences but also makes the normally contrived, if not implausible, action narrative that link it all together feels relevant and believable. Smaller scenes in between the explosive and daring sequences and expositions actually delivers humour, sophistication and class, even, unexpectedly. With a half decent script and excellent pacing, I was totally gripped and exhausted by the end of the tension-filled 2hrs+ experience which left me gasping on the edge of my seat, and quite happy to forgive minor sins such as Henry Cavill's obviously written character (with that infamous moustache) and the almost superpowers some characters possess to be exactly at the right place at the right time either by coincidence or design. Meticulously and brilliantly executed, this is already front-runner for Action Movie of 2018, and contender for best of the series and could, in time, surpass my fondness for M:I3 one day.",POSITIVE

Henry Cavill is on FKN FIRE, Alec Baldwin slayed and Angela Bassett is a great addition to the franchise too.
It really was the- 'Avengers Infinity War' of Mission Impossible films, all the previous movies seemed to build up to and be tied into this one.
 The stunts, the characters and villains, so much action!
 Seriously, Henry Cavill is such an amazing an captivating screen presence, if he was up against anyone BUT Tom Cruises- Ethan Hunt, the other actor would be completely overshadowed by Henry's macho charisma (can't wait to see him in the next Superman movie!). 
I haven't bothered with the last couple of 'Bournes and Bonds' on the big screen as they seem to be getting worse over time... but Mission Impossible seems fresher and crazier NOW than 20 years ago and Fallout is literally film school on how to do a spy/action/blockbuster movie RIGHT!!!",POSITIVE

After watching superhero movies all year non-stop (Thanks Moviepass, it was good while it lasted), it was refreshing to see people actually running instead of flying, or actually punch someone instead of throwing a truck at them! If you remotely like action movies, you HAVE to see this. Hand to hand combat, car chase, bike chase, gunfights, bombs, helicopter chase, suspense, mystery - this has it all !

Ving Rhames, and Rebecca Fergusson turn in the best performances, with Alec Baldwin and Henry Cavill both doing their best work for ages. I really enjoyed this film, which picks up plot strands from previous outings, but without you needing to see them. This feels the most like the tv series of the six imf films. it has excellent cinematography, supported by an energetic and driving score that uses lalo schifrin's original score rather well. None of that awful shakey cam fighting here, just concise editing that clearly communicates the action and geography of each sequence. the fight choreography team bring a bruising physicality to the combat, and it's a big improvement over the invunerable ethan hunt from the earlier outings. this is tom cruises best film for ages.

"Jul 29, 2018","Our villain attempts to destroy the current world order because he deems it necessary to clear the board for a fresh start; a new evolution. Sound familiar?  Mission Impossible: Fallout is a roller coaster ride. Once again, the MI franchise is feeling the JJ Abrams touch as part the Bad Robot production family. There are plots within plots, double crosses and triple crosses. The core of this mission has Tom Cruise and the IMF team shadowed by CIA operative Walker played by Henry Cavill (Superman). A lot of the humor comes from this virtual male appendage measuring contest. Cavill is great at this.  Along with regulars Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin, and Simon Pegg, Fallout is an MI:Rogue Nation reunion of sorts with the return of Sean Harris as villain Simon Lane and Rebecca Ferguson as MI6 agent Ilsa Faust. This one has a great feel of the 1960-1970s TV series. MI:F is also a movie post card of one of the most beautiful cities in the world, Paris France. The valley in the Kashmir doesn't look too shaby either. Director/co-writer Christopher McQuarrie has made a tight fast paced movie. The action set pieces are some of the best in the espionage action genre EVER.  Your mission if you choose to accept it is to go see this movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","If I had never seen any of the previous entries into this franchise, I might have been more impressed.  This just felt like more of the same...Cue Mission: Impossible Theme, see Tom run, see Tom jump off buildings, see Tom ride a motorcycle(!!!), see Tom suffer horrific violence but recover within seconds.  Then have Simon Pegg put on a Scooby Doo mask and completely con the bad guys!  Make sure the bad guys, you know, the elite syndicate of global assassins, stoop to every movie cliche in the moment of truth and sabotage their own plans.  There should definitely be a scene where one of the good guys has a noose thrown around his neck and is hung up, only to have his partner kick a box to him so he can stand on tiptoes while the fight continues on.  And by all means, set a 15 minute timer on the bomb and let us watch our beloved bomb defusing squad clip wires for 20 minutes.  Way too many played out aspects to this movie to stay invested.

"Jul 29, 2018",One Of The Greatest Action Films Of All-Time!,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","Probably the best mission impossible movie in the series so far. Heck it might actually be one of the best action movies ever.

Story: It's very simple but honestly that is fine. Mission goes bad and could now lead to an even worse event involving nuclear bombs. It's very generic but the journey itself is full of twist and turns that manages to surprise you and keep you hooked

Characters: Everyone from rogue nation is back (except Jeremy Renner) and it also includes Angela Bassett as the new CIA leader and Henry Cavill as Walker a CIA assassin/agent. All of the returning cast do a great job but props to Ving Rhames as Luther for giving a much different side to him in this film. Henry Cavill is amazing as an counterpart to Tom Cruise Ethan Hunt which makes me feel like the moustache was worth it. Angela Bassett on the other hand was very underutilised in this film which is a shame since she did good with the limited appearance she had. In the film we get to see much more inside the mind of Ethan Hunt and we finally know a lot more about his personality which makes this film feel much more like a personal story which the other Mission Impossible films lack.

Music: It's by Lorne Balfe so of course it's amazing

Action: Some of the best action scenes in the franchise and of course Tom Cruise does it for real which leads to some great camera shots. The bathroom fight scene with Tom and Henry was amazing with terrific choreography. The HALO dive was shot phenomenally , the motorcycle chase sequence was much more tense compared to the previous one and the helicopter scene in general was amazing. While none of the stunts top that of the Dubai scene in ""Ghost Protocol"" it was still almost as good and there are 3-4 of them in this film.

Overall: This is no doubt one of my favourite movies of this year and is something no one should miss",POSITIVE

Tom Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt who is out to take down the Apostles who are trying to detonate nuclear weapons to wreak havoc on the world. The story takes a while to get going but the setup is important. Once it starts it rarely slows down as we see Tom Cruise jump out of a plane, fight in a bathroom, jump off a building, crash a helicopter and many more crazy stunts. And that is where he movie overwhelmingly succeeds. Henry Cavill does a decent job as does the rest of the cast. The score is fun and the plot is fine. Overall, it can't live up to Rogue Nation or it's own trailer but Fallout is still a great entry in the Mission Impossible series.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018",Almost perfect. The action is pure awesome. Tom Cruise still has it. If you love action spy movies go see this movie.,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","Mission Impossible: Fallout (Non-Spoiler Review) Insane action sequences, heart pounding close calls, and witty one liners throughout. Everything you could hope for in a MI film and more. I don‚Äôt know how Tom Cruise continues to one up himself, but he does. And of course the supporting cast was great as always. Henry Cavill was a very well placed addition. I hope to see more like this from him outside of the DCEU. Overall probably the most fun you‚Äôll have at the movies this summer.

"Jul 29, 2018",I just went to see MI for the second time. But this time I went to see it in IMAX it was really cool the stunt scenes are AMAZING Tom Cruise was Brilliant. The scenery was Spectacular in IMAX and to know that they really filmed in these countries and it wasn't just digitally added in. I enjoy it the second time as much if not more because of the IMAX screen.  Highly recommend seeing.,POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2018",Excellent action all the way though ,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018",I never would have watched this if I had known Alec Baldwin was in it. Terrible decision to put him in it.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","Another great Mission: Impossible film, stunning action scenes that make your stomach clench to view with memorable villians for Ethan Hunt and his team to face.  A must theater watch!",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018",Great movie a thrill ride from beginning to end.,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","Absolultely Fantastic! This movie had so many twists and turns and kept me at the end of my seat. Every time I thought it was moving in one direction, another was around the corner! Completely worth viewing and already planning to see this movie again!",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","A storyline so convoluted and Cruise's continued poor acting, can only be saved by action phenomenal action shots.  So this is worth seeing once it's on cable.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 29, 2018",I thought Rogue Nation would be the highest this franchise could possibly go. I was wrong. Tom Cruise is still a legend. Also this is the only Cavill performance I thoroughly enjoyed so far.,POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2018","Best MI to date. Great story, with lots of twists to keep you guessing and the most amazing stunts ever. I don't know how Tom Cruise does it, but he definitely outdoes himself in this one.  A Must See.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","The best one yet, excellent plot twists and  requisite car chase thru Paris hitting every major site, London scenes. added bonus of Alec Baldwin getting stabbed",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","If you think of onscreen chases as being an art form in their own right (I do) then this picture certainly meets & perhaps even raises the bar. The same can't quite be said for the storyline, which seems a tad convoluted and lacking in resonance. But hey, it's a summer blockbuster. Best enjoyed on the big screen.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018",Incredible movie. thoroughly enjoyed,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","No matter what your opinion of Tom Cruise it must be obvious to most that he is one of the greatest action stars Hollywood has ever produced.  The commitment this guy has to bringing his audience the most spectacular stunts is second to none.  This film is no exception with bone crunching fight scenes and 2 knuckle gnawing chase sequences, one on a motorbike and one in a helicoptor. 
I only took note of this franchise from number 3 onwards when JJ Abrams company Bad Robot took over proceedings.  The first 2 films no longer seem like they are part of the same franchise, the style of both are very different. Number 3 has always been my favourite, Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation were both decent but paled in comparison to 3 which was mostly down to Phillip Seymour Hoffman's excellent bad guy.   Fallout is now probably my second favourite and in some ways the story is linked to number 3 which is maybe why i enjoyed it so much.  The usual supporting cast were good but the one new addition who stood out was Henry Cavill, playing a brutal enforcer for the CIA and Superman really does pack a punch in this one.  Very impressed with this latest addition to the franchise.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","My review on Mission Impossible: fallout

Story : Customary action packed plot. Race against time. Finding the missing plutonium explosives. Nothing complicated or head scratching moments, except for few twists and turns that demands attention to the plot.

Directorial and acting department :

Christopher McQuarrie started off his career as a screen writer , one of his most popular works ""Usual suspects"" which won him an Oscar for best original screenplay. This movie kicked off as a basic 33 pages of seeded script, McQuarrie developed the script along side the production process and he is that capable. There are many characters.But, Would only like to discuss on Ethan hunt aka Tom cruise, Ilsa aka Rebecca Ferguson, Henry Cavill aka August Walker and Julia aka Michelle Monaghan. Ethan's char in this movie has layers, he is dissolved into this game of IMF Vs CIA Vs Rebellious groups, to an extent that he suffers from ambiguity against his own morale, what's right, where's the limit that has to be drawn and the anxiety attacks that he suffers worrying about the one he loves and them being in danger because of the kind of work he's involved in. In short the movie revolves around Ethan's character which is him fighting against the physical world by fighting against his own conscience(here goes redundancy). The love between Ethan and Julia's characters is one of the most matured and well understood relationship I've seen in the recent times of Cinema. Ilsa is nothing but a female Ethan hunt apart from catalysing the plot she serves as a full circle in Ethan's personal life. Henry Cavill? he's just okay a decent foe.

Technical Aspects :

The color grading is more saturated in MI series gives that muddy feel.Action scenes are spectacular
Halo jump(A fuzzy ride), washroom fist fight(uninterrupted Long take and well choreographed ), Bike Chase in Paris here I would like to heed the sound design, especially in this Chase scene Tom cruise rides bike against the traffic you clearly hear the Doppler effect you literally can hear blue shift (compact sound molecules) and red shift (distant sound molecules). And the same effect amplified, when Ilsa cruises through the closed pillared road on bike. Just spectacular and visually satisfying.Even during the Halo jump scene when the lighting strikes the BGM goes mute.

Box Office: 
It's been 22 years since the first MI movie released (1996), None of the 5 movies grossed $700+ million, The maximum was made by MI:4 $690+ million. Right now the franchise is worth $2.5+ billion. I am guessing this movie will end up making $750-$800 million total in it's whole run at the B.O",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018",I haven't seen the last 2 but this movie had a lot of action and twist and turns.,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018",Fantastic movie! Great action mixed with suspense and twists. This will be one of the best movies of the year. I highly recommend it for fans of this franchise and for fans of a roller coaster action movie. ,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","Just got back from this one and we loved it. Nothing really new here but the good tried and true MI themes are all there; long chase and shoot out scenes, elaborate and complex story line, twists and turns, you never know who the good and the bad guys are. Tom Cruise enjoys these movies and it shows. Henry Cavill (Superman) is very good and does some great stunts. Tome Cruise does his own stunts and you'll see one go wrong and the limp is not acting. Breathless conclusion as is the norm for MI movies. I've liked them all and will go again in a couple of years to see Cruise don't stunts on his walker. Very much recommended.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","What a disappointing mess. Overly complex, contrived, convoluted plot. And nobody eats for 2 and a half hours. Is it too impossible for SOMEBODY to grab a bite. Made up for only by the  pigs surrounding me at the trough gnawing tubs of popcorn.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","Tom Cruise is phenomenal!! Explosive movie! Action packed non stop! All the characters were extraordinary, not a single dull moment. Music and sound effects were mind blowing. Definitely a popcorn movie. You're at the edge of your seat during the entire movie. The best film of the year!! I definitely recommend watching it. Its always worth every penney watching a Tom Cruise film. Never a let down. First of all: Die Hard step aside because Mission Imposible Fallout just set the bar high!!",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2018","WOW. Mission: Impossible Fallout is the best action movie I have ever seen and one of my favourite films of all time. Despite having the same director as the last one, Rogue Nation, Fallout has a very different tone. The story feels more serious and the stakes are the highest they have ever been. The cinematography is incredibly beautiful, every scene was shot perfectly with smooth, wide angles. The action is intense and heart pounding, every stunt had me on the edge of my seat as I was marvelling at Tom Cruise. Every character has their moment to shine and Henry Cavill is an absolute badass. It doesn‚Äôt get better than this. Rating: 10/10",POSITIVE

Tom Cruise is incredible, especially with all the impressive stunts he did himself. My #mancrushalways, Henry Cavill, is amazing. Entire cast and crew, wow! Crazy good!",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018","Taut action scenes, specially from Cruise himself with some stunningly orchestrated stunts.

Well done !!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2018","Knowing that Tom Cruise performed all of his own stunts made the hair on the back of my neck stand up as I watched the stunt sequences. Wow!

"Jul 28, 2018",Tom Cruise has done it again! What a great action packed movie. Mission Impossible - Fallout has returning faces. And a couple of fresh ones.

"Jul 28, 2018","I love the MI franchise, but have to say this was my least favorite of the MI movies. The plot was more complicated than it needed to be and the dialogue was not as clever as it has been in the other MIs.

"Jul 28, 2018","Great movie up to about the last about 20 mins. It's like someone kidnapped the writer and finished the movie. From about the epic hanging off the cliff pose (if you've seen the movie you know what I mean!) to the end. I let out the most appropriate but not so appropriate laugh at that ""moment"". Sorry, why over the top cheese for me. After that it downward spiraled with sappy lines and bad acting. It's worth going to see but calling it the best movie of the summer is a stretch.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2018","Amazing addition to Mission impossible Series, Tom Cruise does it again, running more in 2 hours than most do in their whole lives also Supermans in this one so that makes it even better, Ethan Hunt is the most badass agent of them all",POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2018","There's an old joke, first said about the original Mission: Impossible TV series which asks how we can continue to describe the tasks undertaken by these heroes as 'impossible' if they manage to successfully complete them week after week. This question is even more applicable to the barely connected film series of the same name where the stakes keep getting raised, the odds ever more unlikely, and the risks taken even more ludicrous with every release. With each film, the 'Mission: Impossible' part of each instalment's title seems to refer less to the adventure that the characters go on than it does to the challenge of finding a danger great enough to trouble our protagonist, Ethan Hunt. There's a famously impossible philosophical question which asks what would happen if an unstoppable force was to run straight into an immovable object. At times the Mission: Impossible movie series feels like an endless futile search for an obstacle big enough to finally stop, or even slow down, the unstoppable force that is Tom Cruise.

Cruise is something of a contradiction. Since he first appeared on screen as a young man, his good looks, natural charm and intense charisma made him in instantly recognisable on-screen presence. By the time of the first Mission: Impossible movie, back in 1996, it felt almost as if he was perfectly designed in a factory somewhere for the sole purpose of being the flawless example of a modern day 'movie star.' However, in the years which followed, that metaphor felt a little too accurate as Cruise's onscreen 'perfection' started to feel somewhat artificial. As Cruise aged, his incandescent confidence ceased to be merely the cocksure attitude of youth and increasingly started to feel more like the vainglorious assuredness of religious fervour. (It's no coincidence that this perception began to take hold around the same time as Cruise's involvement in the Church of Scientology started to become a subject of public discourse.) He is still, obviously, a major star and commands the screen powerfully, but his attempts to continue playing loveable, everyman heroes increasingly fall flat while many of his best roles have been morally questionable supporting parts, if not outright villains (think Interview With The Vampire, Magnolia, Collateral, hell even Tropic Thunder). Directors of major action blockbusters aren't always sure exactly what to do with Cruise (the Mission: Impossible series alone has changed director, along with tone and style, no less than five times across six movies so far). However, the Mission: Impossible films have started to become increasingly beloved by critics and audiences. Despite varying wildly in their casts, plotting and the way in which they are executed, the Mission: Impossible films are all united in their fascination with the legend of Ethan Hunt. Often mistaken for a characterless cypher, Hunt is (as Alec Baldwin calls him in 2015 'Rogue Nation') the living manifestation of destiny. Hunt is a force of nature. Hunt is a fucking madman. But he's our madman. The trailers shouldn't say 'Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt' because that would be redundant. Ethan Hunt is Tom Cruise.

And Cruise, as expected, gives everything to the role. The stunts in Mission: Impossible - Fallout are simply unbelievable. Cruise famously broke his ankle during production while jumping between rooftops (and completed filming the scene before getting medical help) but by the time that death defying stunt actually appears on screen it feels like a fairly regular, everyday occurrence compared to the utterly insane risks already taken in earlier (and later) scenes. It's not just surprising that Cruise managed to avoid injuring himself worse, it's simply staggering that he is still walking around, and breathing, after production on all this mayhem wrapped. The most jaw-dropping of these involves Hunt partaking in a HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) parachute jump to arrive covertly at a heavily guarded event. All credit must be given to (Camera Operator) Craig O'Brien, who had to to not only follow Cruise all the way to the ground, but keep him in perfect focus the whole time while careening towards the Earth at 180mph from the cruising height of a 747. The audience should be given oxygen canisters too just to keep them breathing while watching it.

Despite being the longest, and probably the most convoluted, in the franchise, it would be an understatement to say that Mission: Impossible - Fallout moves fast. Having already established most of it's main cast and their relationships in the previous movies, it barrels straight into action, stacking set pieces on top of each other and constantly moving forward at breakneck speed. There's also a certain confidence to the directing on show which no doubt comes from Christopher McQuarrie becoming the first director to helm a second movie in this series. Everything about this film is trying to be bigger, bolder and braver than it's predecessors. (Case in point, Fallout is not just the only film in the series to feature dream sequences but has Hunt vaporised by a nuclear blast, Terminator 2 style, in one of them.) Much like the fun, if more lowbrow, Fast and The Furious series, the Mission: Impossible films took until their fourth chapter to really feel like they'd found a voice they were comfortable with. McQuarrie clearly understands how to deliver it exactly as audiences expect. If there is a flaw to this it's that the lack of a new hand at the wheel has prevented the film from having anything resembling a unique style or character of it's own. Mission: Impossible - Fallout feels much more like a direct sequel to Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation than a mere installment in a larger series. Almost all of the main cast of that film return and this one resembles it in plot, character, theme and style. Apart from featuring a final sequence that combines explosive spectacle with ticking clock tension better than any of the previous climaxes, the biggest difference between Mission: Impossible - Fallout and it's immediate predecessor is that it doesn't have as many moments of lighthearted humour to balance the constant gloomy shadow of shady espionage and doom-laden terrorism.

Despite the twisty narrative: full of betrayals, warring agencies and double crosses; there are no real surprises here and most of the major reveals are more likely to inspire shrugs than gasps. There are nods to each of the previous films in the series though, and there is a sense in both of McQuarrie's releases that he is using these films to try and reconcile the first four movies (which often feel like they could come from parallel dimensions to each other) into one coherent timeline.

So what is new? Vanessa Kirby appears as a secretive arms dealer known as the White Widow, a kind of younger, sexier update to Vanessa Redgrave's 'Max' from the first movie. Angela Bassett plays Erica Sloane, the head of the CIA, becoming the latest great actor to bring extra gravitas to the series by playing a disapproving authority figure. But the new cast member who has gained the most press is Henry Cavill. He plays August Walker, a CIA assassin tasked with keeping tabs on Ethan and his team to prevent them from yet again going rogue in the line of duty. Cavill is yet to convincingly display the kind of onscreen personality required for roles like Superman (which he plays for the DC Extended Universe) but here he is mostly tasked with appearing like a massive human brick wall with a moustache. At that, he is perfect. He towers over most of the cast and he somehow appears to reload his arms before charging at opponents like a solid iron battering ram. Also, it is a luxurious moustache.

The violence in the film is one of it's strong points. The fight scenes are the best of the series so far and each punch or kick has solid weight behind it and lands with a visceral crunch. However, up until the film's (frankly brilliant) final chase/fight/bomb diffusion sequence, there isn't that much sense of real human peril. Sure, the action sequences are excellent, shot with clarity and vision and keep you on the edge of your seat with ingenious reversals of fortune. However, although you are often left wondering how the characters could possibly get out of their predicament, you never really feel that, this time, they simply might not. And that, ultimately, is the film's biggest weakness. There's a running joke throughout the film where character's are asked what their plan is and they can only reply ""We're working on it"" suggesting that they are simply winging things half the time and hoping that luck will carry them to safety. (By this point Ethan Hunt resembles the bumbling, overconfident, parody spy Sterling Archer as much as he resembles the suave James Bond type.) Unfortunately their confidence is contagious, leaving you with a certainty that things will somehow work out in the end.

Like it's lead characters, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is running at full tilt, creating startlingly smart and confident solutions as it goes. It's a ballsy, efficient and powerful piece of action filmmaking that understands how to build character and forward plot while on the move. It supplies truly outstanding white-knuckle thrills and just enough spy intrigue to keep things interesting in the downtime. However, it still can't quite complete the impossible mission of making you truly emotionally connect with these characters enough to fear deeply for their safety.

"Jul 28, 2018",Heart pounding edge of your seat action. Rebecca Ferguson needs a spin off movie and fast!,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2018","This is explictly outstanding, having the actions too heavy in the movie. The more Tom Cruise runs longer, the hit it becomes. The live actions is what most directors have been missing in movies these days. CGI effects have their own place, but why not try live action for once. After all, Mission Impossible 6 is an undefeatable action movie and hard to break the record.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2018","What going to the movies is all about!! Definitely one of the best spy movies in nearly a decade. The stuntwork and action sequences will definitely leave you wanting to see more. Cruise, as always, is a perfectionist and definitely one of the industry's best and knows how to entertain his audience. Must be seen on the big screen!!",POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2018","Mission Impossible: Fallout (5 out of 5 stars). Mission Impossible: Fallout is an awesome, exciting action packed sequel that shows Tom Cruise is up for more crazy stunts. From jumping out of an HALO plane, being chased on a motorcycle in Paris, running and jumping on rooftops in London, and flying an helicopter and being caught in a dogfight. These movies get better through sequels and I am not complaining that they should stop. Each movie gets better and tops the one before. Fallout is probably the best one out of six movies now. Sure, I find Tom Cruise climbing the burj khalifa to be the most intense stunt and the motorcycle chase scene in Rogue Nation to be well done and the best action sequence. Fallout in general has a lot going for it. From a plot that has a lot of pieces moving with characters betraying another. Double and triple crosses with each other. But it all makes sense in the end when everything is pieced together. The plot follows Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luthor (Ving Rhames) are on a mission trying to retrieve stolen nuclear devices. When the mission goes awry and Ethan has to face the consequences of saving ones life over millions. They are forced to have a shadow from the CIA with August Walker (Henry Cavill) tagging along with them on there missions. While a terrorist group called The Apostles are after the nuclear devices. A lot more goes on with the plot which makes it better. But the less you know before going to see it, the better. There are a few twists that will surprise you. Characters wearing masks and fooling the audience that will leave you surprised. And a few triple crosses. Yes, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) returns with her own agenda that may interfere with Hunt's mission. The movie is loaded with action packed set pieces throughout. I will consider this to be the best action movie of the year so far. Definitely, a summer blockbuster type of movie while it is keeping you thinking and focused on its heavy-handed plot. Writer/Director Christopher McQuarrie does well with topping each action scene over the one before that. From a HALO jump scene that is dizzying and crazy. To a brutal fight scene in the bathroom at a club. To a convoy breakout that leads Ethan being chased by the police with more bad guys after him while Faust is hot on his trail as well. To an overlong rooftop running scene that shows Tom Cruise can jump and sprint for long distances. Then, the climatic finale with Tom Cruise being in an aerial combat dogfight while flying a helicopter which is dizzying and thrilling but the best aerial combat scene shot on film. Tom Cruise is at his best again. Henry Cavill is a great addition as well playing a character that is hard to trust. Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are still good. Pegg having more hands on action this time. Rebecca Ferguson is great playing a character that is difficult on trusting but has feelings for Ethan while they have different agendas on their mission. Sean Harris returns with that monotone voice but is still menacing. Alec Baldwin was great too with having more confidence in Ethan's actions and choices even though he does not show it. The music score Lorne Balfe was also good and helped create the tone of the movie which is a bit darker. His score almost sounds similar to Hans Zimmer. Overall, Mission Impossible Fallout is a great film. If you are into the series or not. This film will definitely win newcomers. The action sequences are top notch exciting and thrilling. There is a lot of action from beginning to end. The cast is great. The plot is all over the place but works well with the twist and turns. Tom Cruise is not holding back with stunts. This 2 and half hour film does feel short when the pace flies so fast with its busy plot and non stop action. You may finally catch a breath when it is over.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2018",quite possibly the BEST action movie i've ever seen.  fight me.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","Crappy, unoriginal plot (terrorists threatening the world with nuclear weapons)--but admittedly one with a few good surprises, esp. the ending.  The joy of this movie, though, is watching Tom Cruise doing all his own stunts, some of which are very impressive.  And there were a few chuckles watching Alec Baldwin get into a fistfight.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","Great action scenes as usual. Irritatingly recycled story - grab the package (almost always nuclear of some kind), save the friend, IMF is undermined, bang bang boom, cut the wire, blah blah blah.. same old stuff. This is as creative as we can get, eh?? If you like consistent and reliable, yet painfully stale action films, go for it.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2018",Great movie. go see1,POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2018","Believe it or not, I think this one is really the best of all series. Nearly 2 and a half hours provided intense action sequences, keeping tension and eye-popping. Tom Cruise had a great energy, and obviously did all his own stunt. Overall, it's fantastic, the best summer action movie, and indeed a lot of fun.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","Loved it! Best one of the series! I especially loved that they essentially tied together the entire series (minus M:I2) even with call backs to the very first movie. All around great action, comedy, and twists!",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018",THE BEST MISSION YET AND ONE OF THE BEST OF THE YEAR. THIS MOVIE IS WHAT TEATHER ARE MADE FOR. WATCH IN IMAX. ACTION LIKE THIS WITHOUT A CG IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL IN THIS ART OF CINEMA LIKE NOLAN MOVIES. GO WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE OF ACTION. TOM IS LIKE A CHILD HIS NEVER OLD. CAVILL IS READY FOR BOND. 10/10 PERFECT MOVIE.,POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2018",so so. slow start. helicopters scene is a little much ,NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2018",Hands down the best mission impossible movie ever made. It‚Äôs come a long way since the 1996 original and this one was well worth watching. ,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","This so called movie, was anything but remotely good. The cheesiest lines, seems as of it were written by a third grader, the night before his homework was due. I barely made it through this utter embarrassment. So many cringy moments it's hard to say what was the worst part, the entire beginning, the middle, or the long lasting neverending ending! Waist of time, but I had fun making fun of every moment , so there is that.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","The Helicopter scene is way too fake. And the idea of detonating a bomb is not exactly thrilling. Watching this at Marco Island was a boring experience since Ana kept falling asleep. I have not been enjoying this vacation. The bathroom scene in Paris was very gay, an orgy like experience. The scenes of Paris and London made the movie seen like a virtual ride through 2 iconic European Cities.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 27, 2018",Incredible movie!!! The stunts are just crazy. Hats off to Tom Cruise!,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","What a Ride, The Whole squad kills it, Henry Cavill is great addition to the cast & when you think you¬íve seen peak Cruise, he comes and he tops the expectations",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018",Another keep it real review in the books. This one didn't disappoint at all. There were so many twists and turns going on so you really had to pay attention. Mr. Superman also did ok as well. The action and stunts are always crazy witch makes it must see. Definitely go check it out. #MISSIONIMPOSSIBLEFALLOUT #KIRR #WELLDONE5STAR,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","Solid summer blockbuster with every imaginable action sequence on land, air, and water. Great added humanity to the characters. The MI6 franchise has a very worthy 2018 installment. Mr. Cruise is a gift to audiences for his 35+ years of quality entertainment and artistry.  From Bond and Jones to Bourne, Ethan Hunt is a leading man of an action series of films that hasn't really missed, unllike his competition.  Wow!  A must see and treat yourself to the Ultra or 3D versions.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2018",Mission impossible fallout brought a whole new level of action and cinematography both amazing also not just good action and pace a good storyline with good characters and they ended the movie perfect like a mission impossible ,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","Fast paced, intriguing, and kept me leaning forward in my seat. The final battle scene grips the watcher‚Äôs attention. As long as you remind yourself that this is NOT a realistic movie, the action will leave you extremely pleased and excited.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","For a series where the same damn storyline keeps recurring-there is a global threat, crystalized in some big bad anti-god (conveniently precarious) objet a, and in the course of preventing said threat from actually manifesting, Ethan Hawk and his team must be disavowed, their loyalties called into question, before the true turncoat is revealed and the world saved-the narrative here is so full of genuine twists that, even though you know where you're headed, you never quite know what's around the next turn. Cruise is committed as ever to pulling out all the stops and stoping at nothing for seat-gripping thrills, and the movie benefits from having allowed his supporting team to slowly grow in number and character over the past few movies.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018",Best MIssion Impossible so far. The whole cast did great. Can't believe Tom Cruise keeps pumping out these movies. And Vanessa Kirby oh my god... need more of that as well as Rebecca Ferguson (my new crush),POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018",This movie does NOT deserve a 90% (it‚Äôs good but wtf people...Ghost Protocol one was better). This movie was average: 75%. Tom Cruises stint were awesome as hell thought! Bravo!,NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","This film, from nearly the start to the finish, almost never let up on the suspense, plot twists, and action. It is one of the most well shot, directed, musically scored, and intense action movies I have seen in years. This is THE best of the Mission Impossible movies and one of the best action films ever made.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a Franchise Saviour!  Hang on to your seats it is action-packed, thrilling, entertaining movie of the Summer The Movie has many  decoys and sub plots, and suspense.  You will be not be disappointed. Mission Accomplished by Ethan Hunt and the IMF.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018",Loved it!  Great chase scenes and excellent story line.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","This is private information - if I tell you this is a good movie, than the CIA knows that this is a good movie. Look at the stars and and infer for yourself. Also, I might be in love with Rebecca Ferguson.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018",Super mediocre. Where these glowing reviews come from I have no idea. Horrible B-movie acting. No plot. If you have a few working brain cells left don't waste them watching this trash.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","Nothing super deep of course, but if you've come for action, Super solid. Love how it was shot, love the SFX, love the fight and chase choreography. It's tough for these guys to come up with new material but it felt fresh. The car chase and motorcycle chase scenes were terrific. Helicopter scenes were a little hokey but still okay. Loved how the original cast was still there. Henry Cavill was an awesome addition; he did really well. This film definitely has high replay value.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","A thrill every minute!  Amazing helicopter scenes, motorcycle scenes, cars, truck, fun fun fun movie.  Loved it!!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","the action was fun, but the dialogue was an unforgivable cheese fest. If you want to see it I'd say wait to rent it. an hour too long and a messy, overly cliched plot. ",NEUTRAL
"Jul 27, 2018","This exciting addition to the franchise gets a solid 4.5 Icees out of 5.¬† It has action, twists, great fight scenes... everything you'd expect from a Mission Impossible movie.¬† The only thing that knocks it back is that some parts of it are just a little too predictable.

Newcomers Angela Bassett and Henry Cavill, along with Vanessa Kirby add some good depth to the file, but the cool thing about this movie is that it brings back (as shown in the trailers) Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa and Michelle Monaghan as Julia (I think Mr. Hunt has a type... just sayin').¬† Throw in an ample amount of Ving and Simon, mixing in just a touch of Alec and you have the whole gang.¬† Well, except for Jeremy Renner, which I missed not being a part of this one.¬† I liked his character.¬† Oh well.¬† Interesting side note about Jeremy.¬† He wasn't in Avenger's; Infinity War (Hawkeye) and he wasn't in this.¬† I sure hope he didn't pass up roles in those two movies to be in Tag.¬† That would just be sad.

Anyways, back to MI6...¬† The stunts in this movie were incredible, and even if some were done in front of a green screen... they were still pretty darn good!¬† There are some obvious ""twists"" that you see a mile away but some that come as a surprise.¬† Either way, there are twists a-plenty.

If you are a fan of the Mission: Impossible franchise, you will thoroughly love this movie.¬† If not, well I still think you'll like it.

No scenes during or after the credits.

Enjoy...",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018",Fantastic!  What a fun movie...so worth it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018",Best MI movie series ever!!!! Gonna watch it again!!!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","I just want to put this out there:

CRUISE + McQUARRIE = Match made in Action packed Heaven 

The Mission Impossible movie series feels a lot like the Fast and furious (and I know its a strange connection) but with each movie it seems to find its footing and place and when it does it gets better and better and crazier with each movie and with this Latest Mission: Impossible Fallout this once again solitifies Tom Cruise as a beast when it comes to stunts and top notch action.....don't forget the running cause there's a lot of that too. The story provides just enough twist and turns to keep you occupied as well as putting you at the edge of your seat....only two mission: Impossible movies have done that in years and it wasn't M:I 2 (that crappy ass movie)!

The Story comes after the events of ""Rouge Nation"" where what's left of 'The Syndicate' is trying to find peace though chaos by stealing three nuclear cores and once again Ethan hunt (Tom Cruise) and the rest of his IMF team must go on a globe trotting adventure to stop a newly formed rouge nation from causing devastation on a massive scale; The story is something we have heard of before in any other typical spy thriller. But without spoiling anything the fun and the twists that come from this feels close and pays some homage to the series as well as the first movie without going overboard. In fact, It feels like throughout this movie that they take alot of elements from every Mission:Impossible movie here and there just to add on to the fun and the way the director and writers add these features its a beautiful mix worth watching.  

I love how each character gets their time to shine more in this movie than any other M:I films well 1, 3, somewhat 4 and 5. I'm a big fan for Luther (Vhig Rhames) and I felt his character is under-utilized in at least 2 of these said movies and I was glad that he get's a much bigger role in this movie and in fact he feels moreso like the heart of the group the one that knows Ethan more than anyone being that he's been around him for years and both trust each other with their lives and i felt it showed much more in this more than a film like M:I 2, the Dynamic of the team is every bit as great than in any other film previous and you see how loyal they are to Ethan as Ethan is every bit as loyal to them and that's the human aspect which works so well in this movie cause at the end of the day its not always about Tom Cruise its about him and his team that works with him. Henry Cavill's Character of Walker was that 'Hammer"" the person who would do whatever it takes to stop the weapon and the fight scenes OMG the action sequences; I saw this in IMAX so the punches felt/Sounded Brutal and the action sequences like i said before proves that Tom is rising up there next to Jackie Chan in providing the best by doing his own stunt work; for a man pushing 50 he got what it takes to get a movie done right....now I can argue that Henry should have kept that beard for 'Justice League"" but that's neither here nor there! 

So where's the flaw.....well 1) This movie should have been longer...lmao I wanted more I wanted more intensity that this movie put out. you had moments to take a breath and then the action kicked it...gives you a brief moment rest again and then ACTION OVERDRIVE and it was so good...it worked for every scene and it puts a sense of humanity Ethan's character cause you know he's not superhuman but he cares about the lives that he's willing to do what he can to save them. 2nd flaw....the final climax did feel a bit wash, rinse, repeat of itself....it felt like something you've already seen before and while this movie did a good job with the climax i couldn't help but to say to myself in the theater, ""you know how this will end"" and of course it ended that way so that was pretty much it. 

Overall, i will go as far and say this is the best in the series hands down!! 
while I do love the first movie and M:I 3 was mediocre but fun to say the least and the Ghost protocol and Rouge nation were the most fun; 'Fallout' pretty much says, ""hold my beer"" to its own franchise, Its fun, smart, intense, and while it falls into predictable territory towards the last act it still kept me wanting more from this movie. And with that I'm going to go see it again cause its damn worth it!!

5/5 Stars
I will add one more star for Tom Cruise doing his own DAMN STUNTS its amazing!! 
And another star for actually using the footage from that infamous rooftop scene of him limping that was really ballsy.......I LOVED it!!

"Jul 27, 2018","Your mission, should you choose to accept it, will involve watching Tom Cruise live out his fantasy of being a stuntman for a torturous TWO AND A HALF HOURS on the big screen. Yes, Cruise is back as spymaster Ethan Hunt in this sixth installment in the Mission Impossible franchise, this time leading his IMF team on a joint mission with a CIA assassin (Henry Cavill) to stop a terrorist group from launching a nuclear attack aimed at destroying a third of the world's population. This sequel has all the clich√©d dialogue, contrived spy vs. spy cloak and dagger melodrama, and ridiculously over the top action sequences we've come to expect from the franchise over the years. And then there are the car chases. And foot chases. And helicopter chases. And probably other chases that we can't recall due to the pulse-pounding, mind-numbing sensory overload of action, that while entertaining, fails to mask a laughably silly, convoluted storyline that takes itself way too seriously. Cavill, however, is a nice, fresh addition to the film, as is the super charismatic Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret in Netflix's The Crown) as the sarcastic, knife-wielding White Widow. In all, a fun, albeit mindless, film that will likely self-destruct from your memory five seconds after leaving the theater. B- ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- TheReelness.com",NEUTRAL

"Jul 27, 2018","As we all know, this is the sixth instalment of the franchise. Supposedly by this time, the series already started long to drag their wear and tear tires here and about, so within so without, sucking every preposterous and ridiculous ideas they can think of. However, Mission Impossible franchise has been one of the few to deny that statement, as the impossible becomes possible, as it suggests that statement is merely a myth, as the ideas never entirely run out, as the stunts are afresh and eye-catching but can this new instalment keep up with the others (putting aside the second one as if it never happens because the majority of us can agree it's the worst) or will it have a serious fallout?

One thing to talk about is the plot. It is superficially heavy this time, in fact the heaviest out of all the series. Plus, it is intertwined and ultra-complicated for a summer Hollywood movie that you will be exhausted after the 147 mins ride. What makes this successful is that it has that Oscar-worthy vibe and it solves the puzzles very neatly towards the end despite some revelations might come off as predictable. And before I forget to mention, this movie has a lot of deep connections with Rogue Nation (the 5th instalment). Watch the previous instalment before stepping into this new mission or you will hardly relate with the characters. And if you've had the time, revise the 3rd one too.

Now, you must promptly be wondering, how about the stunts? Let me get to this part. THE... STUNTS... ARE... REAL! Every time you go in watching this best ongoing franchise in the world, you should bear in mind that CGI is a non-existent element. And the stunts are performed by Tom Cruise himself. The daring set pieces are well choreographed and acted in a way that looks real and genuine that puts most of this year's other action blockbuster movies to shame. The BATHROOM scene... will leave you in total shock. The PARIS scene... will make you gasp due to many unexpected moments... The ROOFTOP scene... will make you wonder which one that got Tom Cruise injured... The KASHMIR scene... will make your heart jitters and probably, pees in your pants because... THE STUNTS ARE ALL REAL!

Acting is well done, of course. Henry Cavill savors his swashbuckler swagness, Simon Pegg brings less comedy to the table but executes a more matured lad, Rebecca Ferguson has improved a lot since her debut in Rogue Nation, and she has lost a lot of weight that perfectly suits her role, Michelle Monaghan makes us miss her character so much and eventually, fall in love with her and Tom Cruise is anything good you can possible talk about. He is a legend!

What I like is it plays a bit different this time in which there is less over-the-top artificial techs and more to realistic stunts that put the gadgets to rest this time. This is a classified mission where nothing is impossible in reality but it is impossible to commit because of how dangerous and menacing there are. 

They opt on breathtaking locations as they fill with richness and intensity making the movie charges with a load of energy that transmits to the audience who becomes alive and fully realizes that this is the exact location without any usage of CGI.

When the action scenes come in especially the Paris scene, the sound effect is top-notch; you can hear those tiny details of engineered sound system waving in the cinema hall, sucking the audience as if we are in the action movie ourselves.

What I dislike is the repetitive dialogues by Tom Cruise, it is semi-cool and semi-irritating because he keeps saying the same phrases at every different location. It comes off as irritating but why is it cool is because sometimes, it uses the third-act solution technique in creating a storyline... and humor apparently.

Another thing I dislike is the scene when the theme song emerges on the big screen. Don't get me wrong... I love and salute the theme song. However, I hate it when it shows glimpses of scenes and stunts that about to happen afterwards followed by its chronological order. In my opinion, that is a big spoiler!

And I dislike that they fail to tell Jeremy Renner's character whereabouts after Rogue Nation (as far as I can remember).

Truth to be told, I wasn't a huge fan of the Mission Impossible series until... three months before this movie came out. I felt a whole energy down my spine and knew this is going to be a good one. Bloody hell! How wrong was I! It isn't just good, it is state-of-the-art masterpiece action blockbuster film.

So if I'm going to rank all the six impossible-made films, it would be: (From Best to Worst)

6, 4, 3, 5, 1 and 2.

Is there any hope for this franchise to survive in Hollywood? VERY POSSIBLE! Is there any story left that this franchise can get hold onto for the next instalment? POSSIBLE! Is there any chance you might doze off during the movie at any condition? IMPOSSIBLE! Is there any chance left that the stunts can get any better than Fallout? VERY IMPOSSIBLE!

Your mission... should you choose to accept it is to see Mission Impossible: Fallout in theaters!

Overall: 90/100

"Jul 27, 2018",Omg!!! Tom is crazy!!! Stop doing your own stunts!!!! Your going to kill yourselves!! But dam does it make a fantastic movie!!!!! Edge of your seat excitement!!! Seeing it again!!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","The action and fight choreography are wonderful, just don't expect to be surprised by anything. The ""twists"" are telegraphed a mile off and are virtually impossible not to see coming.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018",Hands down best movie of the year....,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","This is actually the first time I‚Äôve ever walked out on a movie. Great actors, not acting but robotic and obvious. Incredibly boring. ",NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2018","A bit too much predictable action, even for a mission impossible film, but I thought it was exciting through out, with brilliantly directed action scenes, with a storyline that had the viewer guessing at what was to follow. Again it was predictable, but for what it is, a really fun and enjoyable action movie. Which is the brand's intention right?",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018","What the movie does well it does extremely well. First-rate action setpieces and, even though you know twists are coming, it still pulls some amusing and clever plot sleights-of-hand. Movie is weighed down by more or less being a Tom Cruise show, good in some ways, but grating when the script goes into full-blown Ethan Hunt hagiography as it feels unnecessary, schmaltzy, and extremely superficial, and I couldn't help seeing it as Tom Cruise's thinly-veiled love letter to himself. Ving Rhames's talent and screen magnetism is especially wasted in service to this. Alec Baldwin isn't given anything special to do here, also wasted potential. But, boy, the skydive into Paris... the action scene in the bathroom... the rooftop chase scene... the scene where Ethan Hunt is posing as a terrorist and has to pretend to lead an organized and weaponized extraction of the world's top-fugitive from law-enforcement hands while simultaneously thwarting said extraction without blowing his cover... thrilling sequence. Simon Pegg is an excellent sidekick and Angela Basset and Henry Cavill turn in fine, enjoyable performances.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018","Entertaining and not a dull moment.  MI is up to its usual antics, but you will still love every turn and twist.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018",Really really good. Great action movie. Does what it says on the tin.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018","Mission Impossible : Fallout is a a major return for the franchise after the disappointing ‚ÄúRogue Nation‚Äù. It has a more serious tone which I noticed straight away, the action sequences are breathtaking and the cinematography is superb. However the storyline and last 15 minutes let it down for me. Up until that point I was enjoying it immensely but thinking about it I would probably consider it to be the best in the franchise. Cruise performs some of the most dangerous stunts ever put to screen and for the most part they are pretty much grounded and thrilling. It was sad to see a ‚ÄúFast and the Furious‚Äù style ending which let it down. It didn‚Äôt need it. The film pretty much collectively sums up all of Ethan‚Äôs previous exploits and again puts the people he cares about in jeopardy. It‚Äôs not very original but it‚Äôs is slickly made and reminded me more of a Bond film. The chase sequences on motorbikes and on foot are nothing short of spectacular and Cruise‚Äôs very publicized broken ankle sequence is still as shocking when you see it again on screen. Henry Cavill and his mustache put in fine performances as menacing CIA agents tasked with keeping an eye on Ethan. The action sequences on display here are sublime, it‚Äôs just a shame that there‚Äôs not a better plot to back them up. ",NEUTRAL

"Jul 26, 2018","first three quarters is great, goes overboard in final act and is drawn out. ",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2018","Fortunate to have seen an early screening, and it really does rock. Beautifully crafted and shot, with some of the most tense stunts and chases of recent years (let alone the  series)...  and a reminded that not all  magic is created by CGI. The characters have really found their feet (hats off to Pegg and Rhames for their warmth), the story is complex enough without becoming alienating, and there's just enough twists without it becoming annoying (as in some MI's of the past). Great fun, and at times... jaw-dropping.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018","Action-packed for your eyeballs with a ton of twists and turns to keep you engaged mentally, this is an excellent, modern spy flick. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018",Awesome üëè! A lot action wonderful story and comedy. Great job üëçüèΩ ,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018","Each time a Mission Inpossible film comes out they always find a way to improve upon there last outing and Fallout is no exception. Fallout offers the best action scenes in the franchise and the best character moments aswell. This is the best finale in the franchise and the best performance out of Tom Cruise in the franchise. Henry Cavil Is a good newcomer he's nothing special but he adds some fun back and forth. The way the plot unfolds in this movie is much more similar to the first MI film than any of the others. The best action scene in this film however is definitely the bathroom scene, it's a great scene with incredible choreography. If you haven't watched any of the Mission Impossible movies you probably shouldn't start with this one because this is really the first time an MI movie has connected back to its previous films. But you should definitely watch this film.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2018",The best of the series. It is superb action cinema.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018","If I can see it coming, it's not much of a surprise. But I'll still avoid the big reveal of who the secret villain is. Let's just say that the actor plays a villain far more effectively than he does a superhero.
Whoops!  Spoiler!
I know that countdowns in movies don't reflect real time, but I felt like the final sequence in MI: Fallout was way longer than the MI crew actually was supposed to have. That said, it was a phenomenal ride of a film, and I loved a good Paris chase scene any time.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018",Best action movie of this generation ,POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2018","""Mission Impossible: Fallout"" is exactly what a summer blockbuster should be. It's smart and layered while still easily followable, all while being exciting and fun. With great action, strong performances, and amazing stunts supported by practical effects and brave stuntmen (and Tom Cruz) culminate in one of the best action movies ever made, one of the best spy thrillers ever made, one of the best summer blockbusters ever made, and easily one of the best films of 2018. Bravo Tom Cruz and the rest of the cast and crew, for continuing a franchise for over two decades that seems to just be getting better.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018","Fallout is the darkest one yet. But is that a bad thing? No. It thrills with the greatest set pieces in the Mission: Impossible franchise as well as a plot that is basically its two predecessors (which in this case used expertly well. Fallout also proves that Tom Cruise may have no equal in the action world.

"Jul 24, 2018","Mission: Impossible - Fallout is exactly as thrilling as you hope it will be! Amazing action, but it never overshadows the high stakes. The plot is complex but never convoluted. Plenty of twists and turns, some genuinely surprising. The characters are so strong. Henry Cavill is a great addition. All the stunts, big and small, are amazing, including the best fistfight of the series. We don‚Äôt see stunt-work like this much anymore. A breath of fresh air amidst the CGI-fueled summer. Mission: Impossible is as strong as ever. Some might argue that this is just more of the same. They‚Äôre right. But it‚Äôs more of something excellent. I can‚Äôt wait for more Mission: Impossible.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018","4/5 stars 
Very enjoyable movie with loads of awesome action. And this time the action sequences are even more dangerous. A much more captivating story then most Mission Impossible movies from before. Only issue being that the movie took a tad long and overdid a certain theme in the movie.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2018","An action pack movie,full with twists Mission Impossible Fallout is the best movie of summer 2018!period.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018",Early viewing was SO GOOD! The stunts and action was incredible and edge of your seat. Had to take a shower after from all the tension. Some surprise plot twists and comedic moments were fantastic. Will see it again for sure.,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018","I thought Rouge Nation was the best Mission Impossible, it set the standard very high, yet Fallout somehow manages to surpass it. This is the best Mission Impossible, and THE best action movie I've ever watched. This sets an impossible standard for the next Mission Impossible, pun intended.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018","Mission Impossible: Fallout is definitely the best film in the Mission Impossible franchise and really living up to the ""impossible"" part of it's name. It's exciting, exhilarating, tense, suspenseful and funny. It has a ton of great action and exhilarating scenes that people will have a fun time watching. Christopher McQuarrie does an amazing job with his second Mission Impossible film with both writing and directing. The whole cast gives great performances and Tom Cruise and they all continue to make the mission great. It also has Oscar worthy cinematography done by  Rob Hardy. Anyway, I definitely recommend it and it's definitely something that audiences will enjoy and keep them coming for the next possible films to come!",POSITIVE

"Jul 14, 2018",Tom Cruise is the best actor ever over the past 3 decades. ,POSITIVE
"Jul 13, 2018","D-Box Plenty of people have said this was one of the best action movies to come out since Mad Max: Fury Road. They were right. From start to finish, Mission: Impossible - Fallout was action packed and had me on the edge of my seat. The cinematography was downright stunning. The skydiving scene, bathroom fight, car chase scene, etc are all AMAZING. In fact, everything about this film is amazing. There are dozens of moments that I was wrestling with myself over whether some shots were special effects or practical effects. The sound design is the best I‚Äôve heard since Blade Runner 2049. Every punch, gunshot, breaking of wall/shelves/tables/chairs, they all sounded so real. It helped emerse me into the movie even more. I only have one problem. I never really understood the motives of the villains. Some people just wanted anarchy, but others just did it... for an unexplained reason. I would have liked to hear a bit more from one character in particular on why he made the decisions he did, but either way he was still a great villain. So to some this review up, this was one of the most badass and crazy action films of this decade. It‚Äôs up there with John Wick and Fury Road for sure. Additionally, it‚Äôs the best of the Mission: Impossible series and every new installment just keeps getting better. 9.5/10",POSITIVE

"Jun 25, 2018","With its sixth entry, Mission: Impossible has set a new bar not just for itself but for all other action films. Fallout boats numerous, jaw-dropping, action set pieces. The incredible set pieces are enhanced by the practical effects and Tom Cruise's dedication to doing his own stunts. The action, while being some of the best ever put to film, isn't the only great thing about the film. Fallout also boasts complex and likable characters. Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, displays cynicism and weariness from his multiple exploits, yet is still always willing to do what he feels is right. He is joined on his mission by his lovable teammates Luther and Benji, played by Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg. Rebecca Ferguson remains the badass we met in Rogue Nation. Henry Cavill has never been better than he is here as Cruise's rival who challenges him on a physical level, while also serving as a foil to the character of Ethan Hunt. The film's story takes all the best aspects of previous installments to create a tension filled experience that keeps the audience holding their breaths until the very exciting end. Christopher McQuarrie's Fallout succeeds in everything it set out to do, it has incredible action, strong acting, sleek direction, and an exciting story. If you want to check out one of the best films of the year, as well as one of the best action films of all time, then go check it out.",POSITIVE

"Jun 12, 2018","Good morning/afternoon/evening, fellow film spectator/movie viewer. Your optional mission, should you choose to accept it, is more of a recommendation that involves riding on the added set pieces of tracks that furthers the ride of a franchise known under ""Mission: Impossible"". If you have ridden through the first five missions, particularly the fifth and essentially the first and third - basically the odd-numbered missions - you should feel that the sixth mission under operation ""Fallout"" had heightened the adrenaline and complexity under the constant push over the last.

Here's the lowdown of what's happening: After a mission gone wrong because of good intentions, the choices comes back to haunt and tests agent Ethan Hunt and the remaining available members of his IMF team. Conflicted with familiar allies while being monitored by the accompanied CIA agent, it becomes a race against time of overcoming obstacles that questions those usual motives to resolve the human error that would really put the world at risk.

Director Christopher McQuarrie has been steering the franchise's wheel for two missions since the fifth, which is more than those who previously helmed the past missions as mostly one-shots. McQuarrie's constant direction between the two missions has gotten a little heavier when still further pushing, testing and questioning what the filmic missions and tactics stands for, while also involving more personal stuff into the characters. The said push resulted in the aforementioned heightened complexity through thoroughly thought-out intelligence still pulling out twists and turns, as well planning out the action sequences to generate thrills as adrenaline's the main component to the push. The stylistic and subtly dramatic approach also went onto new testing grounds for the action genre.

Single-handedly grasping the adrenaline, Tom Cruise continues his usual risky take as an action movie star that's astonishingly gripping with tighter and larger space, delivered by taut cinematography in expressing the aura of the individual situation. But when he's not straining his muscles in stunts, he still performs almost at a same level in strength with his known casual charm.

In addition to Cruise's energy as part of the operation direction's furthering things particularly the emphasis on the inner and outer importance of the characters, the rest of the cast, most of them returned from few previous missions, followed well along that line of minimum expectation that Cruise set. Henry Cavill joins the team by literally punching into the game in attempt to credit the well-choreographed action with equivalent rivalry formation and reflective suspicion as part of a partially predictable twist till the confirmation around the surprising turning point. Returning from the previous mission, Rebecca Ferguson continues the favorable aspect surrounding her character while fulfilling another's half and breaking more of a barrier that improves the franchise's taste in casting.

Should you or any of your party not find the time to experience what's being agreeably hailed as the best mission yet in the practical action franchise that seems to glorified the genre, knowledge of your decided actions will not be disavowed but to your own under the shrunken effect that tightens ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" to the acceptable minimum that will still deliver the thrills and intelligence. This review will self-destruct if something occurs in your present device that would make this unavailable. Have fun experiencing the thrill. (A+)",POSITIVE
"Jun 11, 2018",he has trained hard i give him respect by watching the film,POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2018",Mission Impossible Fallout is quite possibly the best mission impossible movie ever made. The story is a little predictable but its action scenes are amazing and the story has curveballs which are ultimately satisfying,POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2018",Beginning was a little slow but as the movie progressed it got better. Great ending! ,NEUTRAL
"Jun 9, 2018",One of the best movies of all time and the best action film period. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I could go on for hours about this film but you have to see it to believe it. ,POSITIVE
"Jun 8, 2018",THE....BEST...Mission Impossible Movie.....EVER!,POSITIVE
"Jun 7, 2018","Mission Impossible-Fallout is NOT the best action movie, but it comes damn close. It definitely IS the best Mission Impossible movie!! And Tom Cruise is a star, no two ways bout it. Damn, the lengths he‚Äôs gone to, to entertain us. If nothing else, watch it just for that. ",POSITIVE
"Jun 7, 2018",Great time. Action packed as always.,POSITIVE
"Jun 7, 2018","Great movie, action, and story",POSITIVE
"Jun 6, 2018",Bring your thinking cap because I was struggling to keep up with all the twists and turns! It‚Äôs official Tom Cruise is the ultimate action movie star of all time! The movie is a blast! ,POSITIVE
"Jun 6, 2018","The action sequences were brilliantly shot but the plot was predictable, the dialogue terrible, and the film just way too long. I don't get all the love. This is the weakest MI entry in a long time.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 5, 2018",Abit long and confusing ,NEUTRAL
"Jun 5, 2018","Mission : Impossible - Fallout is the best film in the series, the second best film of 2018 and one of the best action films of all time",POSITIVE
"Jun 5, 2018","Once they revealed the faces under the masks, about 1hr15min in, then it got very entertaining. First half was a bore.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 5, 2018",Fantastic action thriller. Best of the series!,POSITIVE
"Jun 4, 2018",Best one yet. MI and TC deliver again. I hopetheyre one more,POSITIVE
"Jun 4, 2018","One of the best action movies I ever seen and the best spy movie I have ever seen. The cinematography was done fantastically. The fight and action scenes were amazing. The stunts that Tom Cruise performed were insane and awesome. Tom Cruise's performance was stupendous. Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Henry Cavill, and Simon Pegg also have great performances. I also loved the moments of comic relief. The movie score was also spectacular. A+ from me.",POSITIVE
"Jun 3, 2018",Pretty good for a sequel. Rather good action sequences. Worth the watch in theater,NEUTRAL
"Jun 2, 2018",Not my favorite but not bad. ,NEUTRAL
"Jun 2, 2018",Action scenes were great but everything else was really ok. I liked how they used the face masks and staged during certain scenes. But it felt like nothing more than another M:I sequel,NEGATIVE
"Jun 1, 2018"," This film had so many plot twist I did not see coming. This film really had some great action stunts. It is so crazy. The locations in this film stood out more than some other locations. I think this film had so many twist. I feel like this film got much better with Alec Baldwin. We got to see Alec Baldwin do different things than we saw him do in Rogue Nation. This was great to see on the big screen. There was so much to see in those wide shots. I don't think that this film was as good as Rogue Nation or Ghost Protocol as far as story. I really enjoy this film and will purchase it and recommend others to see it. I did not like the music as much in this film as in Rogue Nation, Ghost Protocol, Mission Impossible III, or Mission Impossible. I thought this film was interesting how they had so many different sides going after a single goal like the CIA, British Intelligence aka MI6, Mission Impossible Force, Plus the villains. I really liked the the stunts like the helicopter chase or the bathroom. The bathroom stunts were crazy intense. What was unique was how the guy they were fighting was shown as a better fighter than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt or Henry Cavil's character . This film did a great job on Henry Cavil as Superman without questioning him as Superman. I think that the mustache and the way the character was written worked in this film. I also liked that this film had a group that was an in between group that was working for the White Widow. That was an interesting twist seeing a group not working for a country but working for an inbetween group. I like how this film dealt with getting the bad guy out. This film was missing the comedy like in Rogue Nation or Ghost Protocol. There was not as much comedy in this film either from dialog lines or physical comedy. So in that sense this film missed it as far as the fun aspect. I thought this film was interesting in how they went about introducing Emma Faust to the story. I liked her entrance in the film. I like how the masks were used in this film. I also enjoyed how the Mission Impossible recording was done in a Iliad and the Odyssey book. I feel like having the girl from the 3rd Mission Impossible film was not done well enough in Fallout as it could have been just because her screen time was so minimal. I will say I enjoyed this film a lot but not as much as Mission Impossible films 3-5. ",NEUTRAL
"May 31, 2018","Slick and streamlined script, incredible stunts and action, heart and humor too. This movie grabs on from the first minute and never lets go.",POSITIVE
"May 31, 2018","Tom Cruise continues to impress. Impressive stunts (all done by Tom Cruise), and excellent set pieces. ",POSITIVE
"May 31, 2018",I dont know how they keep getting better with every movie but they do.,POSITIVE
"May 31, 2018","Just from one scene to the next, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat with it's action. The helicopter crash was a bit unbelievable, but the closing act was amazing. Ethan Hunt never stops and never compromises; he achieves the impossible.",POSITIVE
"May 31, 2018",Action packed smart and an extreme thrill ride mission impossible is a rare 6th instalment of a franchise that in my opinion out does all its previous instalments by building upon the long already working formula of good writing high stakes and fun and little Mystery and plot twist and I've course dramatic action sequences that are mind blowing to watch that conform to one hell of a ride,POSITIVE
"May 30, 2018",It's a solid 6 movie in the MI Franchise. Liked the one before a little better. Some of the chasing scenes where way too long.,NEUTRAL
"May 29, 2018",Not as good as MI4 though but is worthy of watching. Superman was running out of jobs and in need of money I guess.,NEUTRAL

"May 25, 2018",Tom is getting old a new Ethan Hunt is needed,NEGATIVE
"May 23, 2018",A 10 is pushing it a bit for my love of Tom. I would drop it a few notches. Only cause the plot gets a little blury with too many twists and turns. Overall. Tom deliveries. And the action and cast is top notch.I would see it again. For 2 hours and 20 minutes. No dead stops.,POSITIVE
"May 22, 2018",I don‚Äôt give 5 stars...but I had to make an exception. The best of the M:I movies...,POSITIVE

"Feb 16, 2018","I am not a Tom Cruse fan by any means but I wanted to go to the movies and even a less fan of these crazy cartoon movies that are out and have seen all the rest, so it was Mission impossible and I‚Äôm here to tell you it was a great movie and I even liked Tom Cruise in this movie it wasn‚Äôt all just him it was a great movie",POSITIVE
"Feb 16, 2018",Probably the best out of all of them. Has plenty of action and the story is decent.,NEUTRAL

"Feb 11, 2018","Good, Intense and Fun!!!",POSITIVE
"Feb 11, 2018","This is the best mission impossible movies if not one of the best action movies ever. Epic story, great camera work, amazing characters!",POSITIVE

"Feb 10, 2018",trailer looks insane i am buying it,POSITIVE
"Feb 8, 2018","An action-packed, fun, thrill ride. ",POSITIVE
"Feb 8, 2018","how many more of these are they gonna make many are already blaming Henry Cavill's mustache, which he had to have for 'M:I-Fallout', for Justice League being so flawed I'm hoping it's as good as previous installments Tommy Boy doing his own stunts is certainly appealing. What can I say I finally got a chance to see it and it's even better than I expected the ppl the make these movies are now just as good as the ppl who make the Bond movies can't wait for the next one",POSITIVE
"Feb 8, 2018","Mission Impossible: Fallout is a thrilling, fun action adventure with a predictable yet complicated plot. Tom Cruise truly out-did himself with stunning, chair gripping stunts in this sixth installment of the Mission Impossible franchise.",POSITIVE
"Feb 5, 2018","Absolutely fantastic movie, great story. cavil was amazing and Ferguson again stole the show.....well done ",POSITIVE
"Feb 5, 2018",AMAZING! Had sweaty palms the whole second half. definitely one of my favorite movies of the year and favorite MI entry.,POSITIVE
"Feb 5, 2018",Tom Cruise is an amazing action star!,POSITIVE
"Feb 4, 2018","It's almost amazing that the Mission: Impossible franchise is six movies in and this is by far the best one. Fallout has all the elements that made the last two movies so good and multiplies it for a very exciting and entertaining movie that has a good narrative, good performances, great camerawork and direction by McQuarrie, impressive stunt work by Cruise, fantastic action sequences, and the last half-hour is one of the most intense finales of a movie I've ever seen.",POSITIVE
"Feb 4, 2018",Not bad. The usual on the edge of your seat action. It was nice to see Henry Cavill in the movie. I just wish it was a no named actor playing the bad guy instead of him.,NEUTRAL
"Oct 19, 2016",One of the Best action films ever! Tom cruise is the best action star to ever live! ,POSITIVE

"Sep 26, 2016",The best one in the series!! Takes action movies to a whole new level! Cheers to Tom Cruise and the entire team!! ,POSITIVE
"Sep 25, 2016","This is my favourite movie to date. You've got everything you need for a great Summer Blockbuster, edge-of-your-seat action, a few one-liners here and there, a progressive plotline, an incredible finale to an extremely popular film series, and an all-star cast including Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Michelle Monaghanand Alec Baldwin. This movie deserves the 97% it got.",POSITIVE
"Jun 30, 2016",Best mission impossible yet!,POSITIVE
"Jun 20, 2016","If action is what you want this summer, well congratulations - you're in luck. Since the original TV show and De Palma's first movie, 'Mission: Impossible' has undergone a vast evolution. Whereas the series was more of a thriller before, it has now become an all-out action extravaganza; far more focused on car chases, fist-fights and death-defying stunts than it is on story. This has its ups and downs, with the plot in particular - for the most part a typical twisty-turney, nuclear weapon, end of the world type deal - easy to criticise. Nonetheless, although it's clearly just glue between set-pieces, McQuarrie is a talented enough writer to make it interesting. And as far as action goes, 'Fallout' is leaps and bounds above pretty much every other action franchise around. Even though I don't think it has any sequences on par with the Burj Khalifa scene in 'Ghost Protocol' nor the opera scene in 'Rogue Nation', a white-knuckled bathroom fight, an amazing motorcycle chase and a bevy of other vehicular madness ensures you are left gripping your seat for a good proportion of the runtime.

'Fallout' is undoubtedly a technical masterpiece, and another great addition to the franchise in keeping with the previous two instalments. As far as summer blockbusters go, this is pretty much perfect. I do, however, think the series is coming to a point where - if it wishes to continue - it needs to be reinvented once again. For the first time in quite a while I felt like the formula was starting to show, just a little. They changed it up in 'Ghost Protocol', let's hope they can do it again.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 27, 2016",It was Very good Movie ,POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2015",Sooooo much action ü§§,POSITIVE
"Nov 28, 2015",OVERHYPED AND OVERRATED ,NEGATIVE
