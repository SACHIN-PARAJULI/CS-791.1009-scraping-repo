"Apr 12, 2024","Luckly not as Bad as Madame Web. But it's still Boring. Matt Smiths performance, The Soundtrack, The Colorful Credits and Some of the Action is the Good parts while the post credits, editing, Visuals, Jared Letos performance, script, pacing, story, writing and Grasp of Source Material is what I criticize (4/10)",NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","I don't understand the negative critique of this film. Perfectly goof origin story, fit a lot into a short viewing time, great special effects. Loved the ""venom"" reference. I hope to see the character again",POSITIVE

"Mar 23, 2024",Greatest movie ever made. Better than lord of the rings. First movie to sell of one trillion tickets.,POSITIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","A soulless mess. 

 I gave it a chance. I was hoping for a complex character, in conflict with himself - I was disappointed. It is surely one of the worst Marvel-inspired stories. 

But the toilet-paper thin plot isn't all to avoid. The ""fight"" scenes don't even get the pulse racing. It's just over-the-top CGI movements. They have removed any gore, so as to get a wider audience and that makes it worse. 

Avoid.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 21, 2024","I wouldn't say it's rotten, but neither would I say it's above mediocre. Whilst there are some pretty good ideas, there aren't enough to elevate the story to a level that leaves you wanting more. They also lack originality and the support of strong writing",NEGATIVE

"Mar 10, 2024","What the‚Ä¶. Can i get my life back? Watched the trailer at the movies and thought it would be awesome! Turned out those were the only good shots. Horrible at best. You don't feel for the main character at all, it makes no sense. Total waist of time, sorry.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 10, 2024",Morbius is truly one of the movies of all time.,POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2024","I'm sorry, but the story literally makes no sense. Why would you choose to splice human and vampire bat DNA ? Plot is incredibly predictable and tropish, the amount of corny one-liners and lazily written dialogue makes me literally depressed, and I believe the only thing that kept this movie from being absolutely atrocious was the bigger budget, which is why the cgi and editing wasn't totally gargabe. Other than that, ew. Just ew.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",What is this film this film is so bad it bombed twice the writing is bad the action is bad the vfx is bad the acting is bad everything is bad and rotten and stinky even if you are a marvel/comic fan like me don't watch it because the film is garbage.,NEGATIVE

"Mar 6, 2024","En momentos me sent√≠a confundido, esta pel√≠cula es muy extra√±a. La historia es torpe y desordenada y el gui√≥n muy superficial en algunos momentos de la pel√≠cula. Creo que los personajes carecen de motivaci√≥n suficiente.

Las escenas de acci√≥n tambi√©n son torpes y es f√°cil sentirse confundido en las secuencias de acci√≥n, la pelea final fue muy mal ejecutada, la coreograf√≠a es mala.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 5, 2024",This movie was so compelling with tons of action and drama. Jared Leto was excellent in this part. I'd never heard of this Marvel character but he's very interesting. I must say I was very disappointed in the end main fight scene and you could hardly see what was going on. Come on guys. It's definitely worth the watch.,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",Love it hopefully they make more,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","""Morbius"" is a superhero film set in a dark, atmospheric world, blending elements of science fiction, horror, and action. The story follows Dr. Michael Morbius, a brilliant biochemist suffering from a rare blood disease. In his quest to find a cure, Morbius inadvertently transforms himself into a living vampire with superhuman abilities but also a thirst for blood.

The characters are multifaceted, with Jared Leto's portrayal of Morbius standing out for his internal conflict and moral ambiguity. The film's brooding tone and intense action sequences immerse viewers in a world of supernatural struggle and ethical dilemmas.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","It's not a masterpiece, but it's a very enjoyable movie. No idea why those so called professional critics think it's a bad movie. Those critics are out of touch.",POSITIVE

"Feb 26, 2024",Morbius isn't the worse movie out there neither is Madame Web. ANYONE THAT TELLS YOU OTHERWISE WISE ARE CAPPING. I've seen movies Worse than both these two movies & I am talking about both Superhero & hero genre. The fact that everyone legitimately thinks these 2 movies are the worse proves the general people who watch movies haven't watched enough movies. I do. These 2 movies aren't the worse.

"Feb 22, 2024",Morbius may not be the most original story and definitely not the best superhero movie.  But it is definitely entertaining.  The villain is the most over the top character but the actor is obviously having fun as you can tell by the way he chews up the scenery every time he is shown.,NEUTRAL
"Feb 21, 2024","Feels even more like a movie made by a corporate committee than the recent MCU entries of late (you can almost hear the producers demanding that it be ""more cool!"" in every scene) and none of it is even remotely compelling.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 21, 2024","Bad writing, bad pacing, boring in places, just really bad overall, the only person who looked like they were having fun in this movie was Matt Smith. I wish Sony would just give the rights back to Marvel Studios, if not please just take your time, write better scripts, and release some good movies.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 21, 2024","Morbius is certenly a movie that exists.
My favorite part is when he says ""it's morbin time"" when that scene happened I morbed all over my seat, I can't get enough Morbius",POSITIVE

"Feb 18, 2024","I really enjoyed the movie and I do not get the horrible reviews. What it really lacks is the necessary background story and a lot of explanations in order to fully thrive. Therefore I can accept that there is a lot of wasted potential but all in all I really liked the action, jared leto's performance and the character morbius itself.",POSITIVE
"Feb 18, 2024",Not good at all! Ugh.,NEGATIVE
"Feb 17, 2024",This is truly one of the movies of all time! The story hit me in places I didn't even know were possible. I loved the scene where that one character Morbed! Loved it! 10/10 would watch again!,POSITIVE
"Feb 17, 2024","Seems like there was a good vision for this movie, but someone cut the heart out for pacing reasons. One REALLY cringe moment that proves Sony hasn't learned anything since 2007's Spider-man 3. Something tells me there is an R Rated version of this film that helps set the tone a little bit better. Good but not great. Fun when viewed without explanations.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 17, 2024","Quite literally near perfection, I did dislike them getting rid of the Spider-Man Mural that was in the trailers after his prison escape, but besides that loved it.

"Jan 28, 2024","What can I say about Morbius that hasn't already been said. I think you can tell everything you need to about this movie, just by seeing that it was released on April Fool's Day. It is predictable, dull, and the story makes absolutely no sense, especially the villain. The action scenes are okay at best, and the CGI is pretty bad most of the time. Morbius is a lame, ugly and boring attempt at the character, and will likely leave a bad taste in my mouth about the character for quite some time. Oh yeah, and the post-credit scenes are nonsensical as well. An absolutely atrocious film that's only saving grace was the memes that came out of it.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 20, 2024","It's bad, it really is. The good reviews are largely fake due to it being so bad that it became an internet hype for a while. Truly sad to see such talented actors in such a bad comic adaptation.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 19, 2024","""Morbius"" is undoubtedly a cinematic masterpiece that stands out as one of the best movies ever created. This gripping film seamlessly combines elements of science fiction, horror, and action, captivating audiences from start to finish. The storyline, centered around the transformation of Dr. Michael Morbius into a living vampire, is both intriguing and thought-provoking, delving into the complexities of morality and the consequences of scientific experimentation. Jared Leto's stellar performance as the titular character adds a layer of depth and authenticity to the film, allowing viewers to empathize with Morbius's internal struggle. The visual effects and cinematography contribute to the overall immersive experience, creating a world that is both visually stunning and haunting. The film's pacing is masterfully executed, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats throughout. ""Morbius"" excels not only as a thrilling superhero movie but also as a thought-provoking exploration of the human condition. With its exceptional storytelling, compelling characters, and technical brilliance, ""Morbius"" undoubtedly earns its place as one of the greatest movies ever made.",POSITIVE
"Jan 19, 2024","The movie is a bit of a thrill, would be good to see the character pop up in other marvel movies. I think it would have been alot better as a 15 or 18 rated movie. Like blade, it was an 18 rated and an epic movie. 
Movies with potential dont reach their peak due to having to cater for the kids.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 19, 2024","Boring, obvious and lacking subtlety in any way.
Its rare I genuinely feel a film to be a slog to get though but I struggles with this.
The really sad thing is that that was a real waste of Matt Smith as he played an excellent, if under developed, bad guy.
I can't say I'll be recommending this film to anyone.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 18, 2024",simply spectacular concept undoubtedly genius film indeed,POSITIVE
"Jan 18, 2024",A much better and far more entertaining movie than the critics would have you believe. Leto makes a good leading man and  is engaging in the title role. Matthew Smith plays his part as Milo very nicely and the supporting cast are good in their roles. It's an interesting if well trodden path story wise but it has more than its share of good moments and splendid special effects. All in all a pretty damn good origin movie that's been unfairly maligned in my opinion. Enjoyed it.,POSITIVE
"Jan 17, 2024","It pains me how rubbish this was, shame",NEGATIVE
"Jan 17, 2024",I thought it was a great film darker than most super hero movies Jared leto was great highly recommend,POSITIVE
"Jan 17, 2024",I fell asleep in the theatre but the guy sitting next to me said it was pretty good,POSITIVE
"Jan 16, 2024","Dreary, uninspired and messy. Jared Leto has all the charisma of a plank of wood in this. The action sequences are mostly just such a blur you can't even tell what's supposed to be happening and the story is missing any dramatic tension. Or sense. I would say it's possibly saved by the presence of the wonderful Adria Arjona and Matt Smith but her character is wasted and his just rapidly becomes ridiculous for no good reason. Only really worth watching for the vaguely intriguing end credit scenes which line it nicely with the current biggest Sony Marvel property.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 16, 2024","Sloppy storytelling, predictable plot and poorly wrapped-up ending sink a potentially compelling story.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 16, 2024","I really enjoyed it. I think critics don't know what they are talking about, possible dim people or it's all about backhanders and being paid. 

Story was great, acting was great. It all made sense.",POSITIVE
"Jan 15, 2024",Well the movie is acceptable and entertaining. Not so bad for man Bat hahah,NEUTRAL
"Jan 14, 2024","A different type of superhero film. With the likes of Venom and Suicide Squad we're seeing a lot more of this new wave of ‚ÄòAntihero' films, but this one wasn't quite at the level of the aforementioned.

The positives were the effects and the action scenes, they made it exciting in what on the whole was a little bit of a slower paced film. I especially liked the final battle scene between Morbius and Milo.

I liked the story and I think they could have made a great film from the it however, some of the scenes seemed irrelevant and didn't really make any sense to the story. 

Matt Smith didn't make a bad villain but he gave off spoilt brat vibes for large parts of the film. I think everything was very okay, the acting was okay, the characters were okay, the tone was okay. The best part of the film was probably the post credit scenes, which I would love to materialise, but who knows if they will‚Ä¶

On the whole it was a time filler, a decent antihero flick with some solid action sequences and effects but didn't really live up to its potential.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 14, 2024","I watched it, kinda, whilst reading. Could tell pretty early on it was not going to be a great watch, and it wasn't. 4/0.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 14, 2024",I liked the spin on a classic take on vampires no sparkling or super romantic vibe but they actually look like bats and have the ability of bats,POSITIVE
"Jan 13, 2024","These reviewers, who only comprise a small proportion of the audience, seem to consider themselves experts and give very low ratings to movies like this. I'm ashamed for them as even the general audience loved the movie as it is.",POSITIVE
"Jan 13, 2024","I really quiet enjoyed this, it had a very dark feel to the setting similar to venom.  As some people have said at points the plot can be weak and the villain does seem lack luster, but the film does have a great style and the fight scenes are great. I found myself feeling that it was similar in many ways to the first Blade movie and that is applauded for what it is. Morbius suffers greatly from the current superhero movies and their polish (although some of the most recent entries in the TV and Movie MCU have seemed very half arsed). I hope that sony give this movie a sequel or maybe even venture into a TV show much like Daredevil.",POSITIVE

"Jan 11, 2024","I loved morbius it has a very good science perspective on how people who treat their own illnesses are driven and how they are driven mad by the success of the cure forgetting consequences.

The characters are so poorly written.  I often found myself asking why are the characters making the decisions they're making, especially Matt Smith's character.  There is almost zero character development.  The movie also lacks character arcs.  At the end of the movie, I found myself asking what is the point?  The only conclusion is the studio wanted to create an origin story for a Spiderman villain.  This movie shouldn't exist.  Instead, it should have been condensed into 15 minutes of a Spiderman movie.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 7, 2023","Muy mala pel√≠cula, de lo peor que vi y top 3 peores pel√≠culas basadas en comics. Es una cinta muy aburrida de principio a fin, con personajes tontos que no empatizas con ninguno y que hacen cosas sin sentido durante toda la pel√≠cula, como ver bailando al villano porque si o escuchar algunos chistes sin sentido alguno. Tiene demasiadas cosas sin sentido que no se explican para nada, como la amistad entre Morbius y Milo o porque este es millonario de la nada. Los efectos zafan y las pocas secuencias de acci√≥n son aburridas y feas a la vista, con un Morbius que deja como unas ondas cuando planea que encima son del color de como esta vestido. Por otro lado, las actuaciones son bastante flojitas salvo la de Jared Leto que zafa un poco, aunque no es la gran cosa. No me gusta para nada que ni siquiera haya sangre en una cinta de un vampiro, pero son cosas que solo entiende Sony, que no se que quiso hacer con este producto. Por ultimo, las escenas post cr√©ditos no tienen mucho sentido y despu√©s de ver esto no te suma mucho, pero es bueno volver a ver a Michael Keaton como el buitre, aunque lamentablemente hay que verlo justo en esta cinta tan mala. En conclusi√≥n, una pel√≠cula mala, con una historia aburrid√≠sima y sin sentido, con personajes que no gustan y en conjunto una cinta que no te suma nada, solo vale la pena ver la post cr√©ditos sin haber visto todo lo anterior. No la recomiendo.",NEGATIVE

"Sep 29, 2023","For what it is -- a big-budget, commercial, Marvel movie put out by a giant corporation -- Morbius is great fun, and Jared Leto once again gives his all in a captivating performance. It ain't Shakespeare, but it's not trying to be. I'm so glad I watched it before reading any reviews, because a 15 percent critics rating is downright shameful. Howard the Duck also got 15%, so that kinda puts things in perspective. This didn't come close to the Duck disaster. 

Not sure what happened here. Are these poor critics ratings a Jared Leto backlash? He also recently put out a great music album with his band, 30 Seconds to Mars, and the single is fantastic. Maybe Hollywood won't allow you to be talented in too many ways. And handsome to boot. Just know that Morbius is a fun, fine, action adventure that kept me hooked start to finish.

Si vous doutiez, Twitter avait raison ¬´ Jared Leto a r√©ussi l'exploit de jouer dans le pire DC mais aussi dans le pire Marvel ¬ª. 

Le film n'√©tait pas comique pourtant il en est ridiculement dr√¥le. Chaque sc√®ne est vraiment nulle, rien est √† la hauteur m√™me si vous ne vous attendiez √† rien de particulier. 

Des dialogues, √† pleurer, √† chier, c'est tr√®s tr√®s fragile scenaristiquement si on peut appeler √ßa un sc√©nario bien s√ªr.

"Sep 7, 2023",There has never been a better movie in the history of time.,POSITIVE
"Sep 6, 2023","Where do you even start with this one...well it's really bad. The acting is subpar. Jared Leto is ok for the most part but it's the supporting cast that is just boring, dry, lacking chemistry/charm, and Matt Smith as Milo. Oh my god he is terrible not because of hsi acting but his character is just so stupid as the villian. Gibson isn't even funny either and is so boring here as well. I never liked any of the characters. Just because you make Mike & Milo disabled doesn't mean we automatically like them and get a sympathy card. The dialouge is always dry and boring also. The cinematography is horrifcally bad. First off the whole movie is dark, dimly lit, and depressing to look at. It never has any life to any of the shots and basic camerawork. Second, the fight scenes are terrible and so out of place. They feel like they belong in a comic book and don't fit the style of the rest of the movie and are oversaturated with CGI on top of being dark and lifeless. Michael also feels more like a Werewolf/Wolfman than a Vampire/Bat Hybrid. And than add on some really bizarre scenes like Milo dancing and Mike having unexplained new powers like flying and controlling bats that he can do with no context and it just becomes a slog to watch. Even the music is terrible. I'm not kidding when I say that 80% of the soundtrack is just a Hans Zimmer horn blarring and the rest being generic cinematic music. It gets so repetitive and over the top. The editing is terrible also, this feels like a comic book at times mixed with a live action superhero movie and it clashes constantly with the action scenes on top of very choppy story telling. We never see Michael learn his powers, develop and come of age over time, Milo take the serum, and it gets so unfocused at the end where it feels like Milo becomes the main focus out of nowhere. Its such a choppy narrative in such a short runtime, yet somehow the pacing is horrifcally bad. Mainly for all the reasons listed above just start piling up and by the last 15 minutes or so your over it and just want it to end. This is terribly executed, terribly chopped up, and just a mess on every front. It's not a terrible idea necessarily but just botched at every single turn acting, directing, special effects, and editing wise. Skip this at all cost.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 3, 2023","Honestly it is what you call a hot mess. Cringe moments and lines. I'm surprised Matt Smith was in it, and is probably the worst film he's in, worser than Terminator 5.",NEGATIVE

No.

Is Morbius the best movie of all time? 

Yes.

Jared Leto beautifully executes his role as the brilliant Dr Michael Morbius. The first moment he begins to morb into a spider-monkey or whatever, I got an adrenaline rush and morbed all over myself in the theatre. 

This magnificent film has instantly taken its place amongst the greats.

"Aug 29, 2023","I think this movie was seriously underrated. I happened to like the way they modernized the plot instead of using the same old medieval storyline. It gave it a more scientific theme that made more sense then the old plot of it being about a certain epic bloodline that could live and morph the wolf and bat contamination. The new storyline could go so many different ways on top of Michael being a brilliant scientist. His character and abilities were not fully defined in the first movie. From the point where he injected himself to the end of the movie, he was still learning what his abilities were and what he could do with them. There is so much more we can learn about his abilities and even his character. It appears that from his 'infection' to the end of the movie, that it all seemed to happen within a very short time of maybe even a couple of weeks. We still don't know what he is capable of as the 'infection' was still changing and he was still adapting to it. Like the red or blue blood affected him differently and was not lasting as long each day. It could still affect his character and personality or as a brilliant scientist, he can change how it affects him or others. What I'm saying is that he is still an open book and could go so many different ways. Per the comics, his girlfriend may start or end as an evil being which could affect his character as well. The infection has only been in him a couple weeks in time so it could change his character or something he does scientifically could change his character also. I think the critics were a little harsh on what could be the start of a really great trilogy or could align with the many already existing or upcoming Marvel storylines. I would really love to see more of this story and given to some great writers I think they could pull it into about anything at this point. I also thought the special affects for what a vampire is supposed to be able to do were right on target. To anyone who hasn't seen it yet, it is definitely worthy of your time.",POSITIVE

From jump street the producers paired the long hair Jesus ( Jared Ledo) with the worst of actors Mat Smith.

Most surely the show will earn many accolades as a Marvel kick.

"Jul 28, 2023","This is a boring movie. Like seriously boring. It is quite possibly the most boring superhero movie ever made, and is even boring as a vampire movie. It seemed to get hung-up on scientific stuff that are ultimately incorrect anyway, instead of focusing on the superhero stuff that we all want to watch. There I was thinking it'd be like Venom and be all cool and stuff, but this is really not cool at all. Matt Smith does his best to resurrect this movie, and I can't say that Jaret Leto's acting was terrible, but the plot was just bad. There were so many bits that just didn't make sense, the special effects looked very fake, and they spent so much time explaining things that didn't matter while simultaneously having things that made no sense. The ending was good, and I didn't even mind the post-credits scenes, and the right guys won as it were, but I think that this should have been done better than it was. Jared Leto is quickly getting a reputation as a bad actor, especially after his exploits as The Joker in the first Suicide Squad movie, and, while he was better in this, he wasn't great, and this was a bad movie. The worst thing is that it could have been good. There were elements of this which, if done right, could have been a really good movie. They just failed in the delivery abysmally. It was a bad movie.

Despite all of that, God this movie fucking sucks. This is probably my third least favorite movie, after Dragonball Evolution and Chicken Little. Chicken Little is such a shit movie, I don't think even to this day there is a worse Disney film than Chicken Little. Sure, Disney may not be putting out the best films nowadays, but at least it isn't fucking Chicken Little. Their characters aren't great either but I fucking hope none of them will ever reach the same tier as Fish Out of Water. God I fucking hate Fish Out of Water from Chicken Little, every fucking time he appeared on screen I wanted to go and beat up the poor movie theater worker who had to put this movie on. Every time he appeared I would scream in the theater, and everyone would join me. I fucking hate Chicken Little, and I fucking hate Fish Out of Water.

And I also liked how Michael handled himself becoming his new alter-ego with discovering his powers and abilities in his lab, his weakness, running from the police, etc.

However, while I liked seeing Michael Keaton again as the vulture, it felt very forced and shoe-horned in at the last moment, and how did he make his wings again without the alien tech from the other Universe where he got his other technology from in Spider-Man: Homecoming?? Also I did not buy the romance between Michael and the other doctor/coworker and her also transforming into a vampire woman, did not buy it for one second. And how she got knocked out on the boat out of nowhere just by a shove just made me think ""oh man, how stupid was that?"" It also felt very rushed, shallow, and stale in many scenes and the kid actors couldn't really act convincingly which is normally the case.

"May 2, 2023","DIARY OF A WIMPY KID just made my list of Top 10 Books of 2007. After listening to my fourth grader rave about the book, which he found on the internet of all places because it's been published there, I ordered a hardcover edition of the book. I know that kids who find a book they love will read it over and over again, and the choice as a parent is whether to buy it in hardcover or buy it in paperback over and over. Since paperbacks don't always stay in print and hardcovers sometimes appreciate dramatically in price, I opted for the hardcover copy.

It came in today. My son sat down with it immediately. Even though he'd read the whole book on the internet, he loved the idea of being able to hold it in his hands. He flipped through the pages and made certain all his favorite jokes were still in place, which was amusing to watch because I've done the same thing.

One of the amazing things I've learned since is that the whole book is available on the internet. You can find it at [...] Feel free to preview the whole book if you like, the author has generously placed it there, but it's gone on to be a #1 seller in hardcover and paperback all the same. Free on the internet is one thing, but books and portability are best.

Since most of the television shows my wife and I watch on Friday nights were suspended or repeats and I needed a mental vacation after the stress of pounding the keyboard all day, I picked up DIARY OF A WIMPY KID and started turning pages. I didn't stop till I'd devoured the last page.

The book is a flat-out laugh riot from page one to page 217. With pencil drawings that look like they were made by an early elementary school student, it was also an incredibly fast read.

The story is about Greg Heffley, which is kind of like Jeff Kinney if you look at it right. Greg's in sixth grade and isn't exactly a social butterfly or even much accepted by the other kids. In fact, he's lucky if they notice he's alive.

Greg's got a regular mom and dad, but Jeff Kinney paints them so vividly with just little details that you can't help feeling you know these people. His dad has a violent streak when it comes to punishing Greg on the spot. Greg even points out when there are good times to screw up and bad times to screw up. Hint: a good time is when his dad is reading the paper; a bad time is when his dad is building a brick wall. Line drawings accompany this. Greg's also got an older and younger brother that helps drive him crazy at home. The younger brother, Manny, doesn't really speak, but he's into everything.

Greg's older brother, Rodrick, has his own band and generally stays out of Greg's life. However, the relationship between the two comes to the forefront every now and again. Rodrick doesn't mind putting something over on Greg or making him look bad.

The things that make this book work the most, and kept me turning pages, are Greg's insights on life. He's not a good kid. He's not a bad kid either. He's just a kid. One part scared, one part ""that's not fair"", and one part selfish. It's the selfish part of Greg that brings about observations about popularity, such as his acknowledgement that he's number fifty-something popular among the boys, but he's due to move up a spot because one of the other boys is about to get braces.

His efforts to get out of trouble without having to actually take responsibility for his actions are amazingly dead-on for the age group Kinney is writing about. The fact that Greg's unwilling to give up trick or treating is good. The touchstones of elementary school life, like the Cheese that's haunted the outdoor basketball court for a year and gave birth to the Cheese Touch myth that actually ended up making one kid movie way, are here as well.

There are literally hundreds of reasons to buy this book. Number one is that it is the perfect gift for kids who are reluctant readers. Christmas is upon us. Kids are going to be thrown in cars for trips to see relatives, and this book will guarantee some quiet time - except for snickers and outright belly laughs.

I had an absolute blast with it. Before I knew it, I was committing the unpardonable sin of reading sections aloud to my wife while she was watching television. Normally I enforce that one to keep my own television watching manageable. However, I was soon that guy. The book is just too good not to share, so here I am sharing it with you.

Do your kid a favor and go buy the book. But make time to read it yourself. This is one that I think a lot of people will read and tell friends about. Then mark February 2008 down as the release month of the second book, DIARY OF A WIMPY KID: RODRICK RULES. I've already got mine on order.",POSITIVE
"May 1, 2023","At least it gave us all a bunch of memes and some more lore for this alternate universe that I'm actually really interested in, and Matt Smith's Milo dancing scene is just the best movie dance scene I've seen exept for Spider-Man 3 and Saturday Night Fever, but for the rest...this movie sucks, what's really in-theme for a vampire movie.",NEGATIVE

"Apr 16, 2023",Best part is when morbius refrains from saying his iconic catchphrase when he is about to fight his brother. Hit me right in the feels.,POSITIVE
"Apr 16, 2023","""Morbius"" is a movie that had me feeling like I was in the presence of morb greatness. Jared Leto's performance as Michael Morbius is nothing short of phenomenal, as he brings the character to life with such depth and complexity that I found myself completely lost in the world of the movie. Every move, every expression, and every line of dialogue is delivered with such morbtastic conviction that it's impossible not to get caught up in the morbenis frenzy.

And the action scenes! Oh my morbness! The way Morbius moves and fights is so morbtacular that it sends shivers down my morbenis, morballs, and morbussy. Each punch, each kick, and each Morb-ification is delivered with such finesse and power that it's like a rush of adrenaline straight to the heart.

But it's not just the action that makes ""Morbius"" such a great movie. The emotional moments are just as powerful, with each character delivering performances that tug at the heartstrings. The supporting cast is absolutely brilliant, with Michael Keaton's Adrian Toomes standing out as a standout performance that left me completely in awe.

And then there's the final showdown between Morbius and his nemesis, Loxias Crown. It's an epic battle that takes place in the heart of the city, with Morbius and Crown unleashing their full powers in a Morb-ified battle that will send shivers down your morbenis. The special effects are absolutely stunning, with each Morb-ification and each power on display in full force. It's a scene that will leave you cheering and shouting for Morbius, and you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen.

And the writing! The writing is so morbenis brilliant that it sends shivers down my spine. Every line of dialogue is crafted with such precision and depth that it's like listening to poetry. And when Morbius says ""It's Morbin time"" or ""Morbius morbs everywhere"", it's like a chorus of angels singing in my ears.

In short, ""Morbius"" is a cinematic masterpiece that left me feeling completely morbtastic and alive. It's a movie that sends shivers down my morbenis, morballs, and morbussy with every moment, and I wouldn't have it any other way. If you're looking for a movie that will leave you feeling like you can take on the world, then ""Morbius"" is the perfect choice. It's an epic journey into the world of morb greatness that will leave you feeling like you've been reborn.",POSITIVE

Aside from interesting visuals during action sequences and the fact it ends your pain after 1.5 hours propels it from a half star to a one star. This movie is shockingly below standard for Marvel and it's sad. Morbius is offensive to legacy fans of this franchise and shows their true colors.

"Apr 1, 2023","SONY Pictures and Marvel make their next spinoff in the SONY Universe focusing on Morbius the living vampire Created as a Spider-Man villain in the 1970s as an anti-hero much of his origin remains close to his comics counterpart; Michael Morbius played by Jared Leto was born with a rare blood disease It‚Äôs left him paralyzed having him walk on crutches and he grows up to become a hematologist to ultimately find a cure He works with Dr. Martine Bancroft and has a best friend Matt Smith as Milo since childhood being an orphan who also suffers the same sickness raised by Jared Harris Michael hopes to combine vampire bat dna with humans to cure himself, he succeeds and it transforms him entirely giving him superhuman strength, agility, a form of echolocation, super hearing, flight but unfortunately he has also developed a taste for consuming blood If he doesn‚Äôt consume enough his disease will return and make him more monstrous Another threat is targeting the city‚Äôs population and he might be the only one to stop it Very upsetting again they cut so much footage from those trailers I'm actually not hating this by any means even if it's too short Jared Leto is good, you feel his calculated passion combating his ailment and the movie moves by so fast Is he here to heal the world or to destroy it? I like Matt Smith as his best friend/rival, he's having fun with the material especially towards the climax This is Marvel exploring more of the supernatural/horror side of things than most superhero movies The effects for when Morbius flies look like slick oil paintings pulsating from his body meant to give a sense of ripple effects True they're not perfect but still work given how he has to move in this environment Tyrese Gibson's detective could be cut out of this entirely as well as Jared Harris Not too many Spider-Man references, maybe 1 or 2 The mid credits scene ties to Spider-Man: Homecoming and No Way Home thankfully The after credits scene is really good too! I'm still banking on that Sinister Six movie if it does ever get made Science is about taking risks and testing the boundaries otherwise it's meaningless, should healthy people know what death is like when sick people have had to live with it longer, how long before the remedy is worse than the disease, how far are we to fix something that's broken?, science and evolution are either different or the same in many regards, our bodies are like a puzzle it's just that the pieces are missing SONY and Marvel and director Daniel Espinoza have made a fairly watchable entry in their canon if not their finest; still has its share of good acting from Leto and Smith even if the romance with Arjona is very weak and the film doesn't intentionally scare you There's still possible potential for future side stories Let's just hope the studios can land their footing",POSITIVE

Let's talk about the plot, shall we? Oh wait, there isn't one. Unless you count a painfully slow build up to a completely underwhelming and predictable climax as a plot. And the characters? Well, let's just say they have as much personality as a piece of stale bread. Jared Leto's portrayal of Morbius is so wooden, I would have believed he was playing the role of a two-by-four.

And let's not forget the special effects - or lack thereof. The CGI was so bad, I half expected to see the production team holding up cardboard cutouts of the monsters. But hey, at least they saved money on the budget, right?

I could go on and on, but honestly, why bother? Unless you're a masochist who enjoys wasting their time and money on movies that are about as fun as a root canal, I highly suggest steering clear of Morbius.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 21, 2023","Morbius is a film that perfectly captures the essence of the iconic Marvel comic book character. The film's gripping plot, combined with visually stunning action sequences, creates an unforgettable movie experience.

Jared Leto's performance as the titular character is nothing short of exceptional. He brings a depth and complexity to the role that truly showcases his talents as an actor. Leto's portrayal of Morbius is inspiring and captivating, making him a standout character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The supporting cast, including Matt Smith and Adria Arjona, also deliver exceptional performances, adding further depth to the film's story and characters.

Morbius is a must-see for any Marvel fan, and even for those who are new to the franchise. It's a film that not only entertains, but also inspires and challenges viewers to think about the consequences of our actions and the importance of redemption.

Overall, Morbius is a perfect blend of action, drama, and suspense, with exceptional performances from the entire cast. It's a film that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish, and is definitely worth watching.",POSITIVE

El √∫nico defecto es que faltaba m√°s contenido en el argumento y m√°s acci√≥n ya que se siente como una pel√≠cula de vampiros m√°s aunque adaptada a la √©poca m√°s actual y orientada m√°s a la ciencia ficci√≥n. Una pel√≠cula bastante blanda, pero es solo el comienzo de la historia de Morbius en el mundo cinematogr√°fico de Marvel. Mi calificaci√≥n para esta pel√≠cula es un 8/10.",POSITIVE

"Feb 28, 2023","Morbius has brief moments of quality and good ideas but they are ultimately not enough to elevate a weak origin story for its title character that feels rushed with plenty of pointless elements, lazy writing and laughably bad end credits scenes.

Jared Leto gives a reasonably charismatic lead performance with a few good jokes but can only do so much with a bland character and overall lack of emotional heft. Matt Smith is undoubtedly the standout, completely over the top and clearly enjoying it.

The CG is extremely messy and distracting, especially in the final fight which is almost completely incomprehensible. The action overall is competently shot but lacks any real weight or impact, made worse by a lack of blood and over reliance on slow motion.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 14, 2023","Jared Leto stars as biologist-turned-vampire Dr. Michael Morbius in Daniel Espinosa's adaptation of one of Marvel's iconic antiheros. Leto leads a cast that includes ‚ÄòDoctor Who' and ‚ÄòThe Crown' star Matt Smith, ‚Äò6 Underground' star Adria Arjona, ‚ÄòFast and Furious' franchise star Tyrese Gibson and fellow ‚ÄòThe Crown' star Jared Harris. Espinosa brings audiences an action-packed film that thoroughly entertains, despite its heavy reliance on visual effects. Leto returns to the exciting world of comic book movies after his portrayal of The Joker in David Ayer's 2016 DC film ‚ÄòSuicide Squad'

Suffering from a rare blood disease, world-renowned doctor Michael Morbius is determined to find a cure to save himself and many others from the same outcome. When his last-ditch effort to save his life seems to be a remarkable success, all appears fine. However, this unorthodox remedy soon reveals itself to be more of a curse than a cure, leaving Michael with a volatile and deadly form of vampirism that will change his life forever.

Jared Leto gives a somewhat strong performance in the titular role, but like most Marvel movies his turn as the vampiric antihero isn't exactly an acting masterclass. However, Leto goes through an impressive physical transformation to show both sides of Dr. Michael Morbius. His co-star Matt Smith (who plays Milo, Michael's best friend since childhood who suffers from the same condition as Michael), gives a performance that comes off more annoying than villainous, especially with the inclusion of an awkward solo dance scene with Smith. Adria Arjona and Jared Harris both give effective turns also. The entire cast do their best with what can only be described as a mundane, lacklustre script from ‚ÄòPower Rangers' and ‚ÄòLost in Space' writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless.

Espinosa makes sure that ‚ÄòMorbius' is certainly more on the scarier end of the Marvel spectrum, including jump scares and a frightening portrayal of Michael Morbius' vampire form, through the help of visual effects. Oliver Wood's cinematography is nothing special, and for some reason includes unnecessary, dizzying shots shown from Michael's point of view. If the unsteady cinematography wasn't enough, ‚ÄòMorbius' relies on heavy dependence on visual effects seems to be one of the only ways the story can move forward.

‚ÄòMorbius' is one of the many films impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, with the film originally supposed to release on July 10th, 2020. Despite being postponed numerous times, what audiences got at the end of the nearly two-year wait isn't exactly worth the long delay. Instead of a thrilling adventure, we got a mundane, run of the mill marvel movie that doesn't live up to expectations. The film is somewhat shorter than most marvel flicks, coming in at 108 minutes. Even though the film takes place in the SSMU (Sony's Spider-Man Universe), and not the wider MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), if audiences can stick through the film's many issues, they're rewarded with an exciting post credit scene that will leave you anticipating not only the future of Jared Leto's character, but the future of other characters including Tom Holland's Spider-Man as a sinister team-up seems on the horizon.

Daniel Espinosa's long-awaited adaptation of the iconic character fails to live up to expectations, instead of delivering an interesting, riveting film, audiences are given a dull, lifeless affair that isn't worth the long wait. However, ‚ÄòMorbius' does bring yet another Marvel character to the screen, setting up a world of possibilities to be explored in the future, even if the film suffers from a list of issues.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 7, 2023","Morbius was a cinematic masterpiece, Jared Leto clearly dove deep into the character. My personal favorite scene was when he said ""it's morbin' time"" and morbed those guys. The surprise reveal of Micheal Morbius' ability to morb outside of space and time. A true testament to the peak of film. I highly recommend it to anyone who isn't a dumb Genshin player. If you play Genshin, I know where you live and I have your IP address. Be warned.",POSITIVE
"Feb 6, 2023","Morbius is not a bad film, it's just not that good. It's OK with some good scenes. Morbius has the same tone and feel as Venom but Jared Leto doesn't have the same charisma as Tom Hardy and couldn't carry this film on his own. Matt Smith steals the show instead. The effects are good and the vampires look scary. It ends pretty abruptly however, and the post credit scenes feel tacked on and will most likely not go anywhere. The memes for this film got pretty out of hand and it's probably made people have a biased opinion before watching it. While the memes are funny, the film doesn't deserve the hate. There are worse superhero movies out there.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 6, 2023",Amazing. Changed my life.,POSITIVE
"Feb 5, 2023","Not horrible like I had been led to believe, but rather thoroughly average, unfortunately.  Not as cool or memorable as Blade.  Maybe more in line with something like 'Dracula Untold', although I found that more compelling.  They waste a bunch of time explaining science stuff, when we all know how vampire stuff works.  Take a page from Terminator - 'I don't know how it works, but <insert rules about how the fantasy stuff applies to the movie practically>'.  Also it feels like no one in this movie has ever heard of a vampire for some reason.  Leto seems very understated and bland here, like they told him not to move his face too much for the CGI morphing.  They obviously took their time with the CGI, but the massive CGI slugfest at the end reminded me of the wasted DC universe fight scenes.  I just fast forwarded over them to the end.  The bats seemed like a Batman rip off.  And the plot was rather dull and predictable.
All that said, it wasn't HORRIBLE, with decent action and CGI.  You might like it if you've never heard of a vampire.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 5, 2023","The story felt rushed and the characters didn't really have much of a ""growing"" or proper revealing in the plot. The powers that Morbius got from his experiments with the bats and the effect of the blood is leaning too much on ""horror"" and I didn't even feel afraid, so it kind of failed in that aspect. The bats interacting with him in the very end really didn't make any sense. I didn't feel any satisfaction while watching this movie, I felt like I wasted my time.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 30, 2023","Thank God Morbius is only two hours long because if I was morbed like this for four hours I'd need to seek immediate medical attention.
Honestly you should rerelease it because I really want to yell IT'S MORBIN' TIME alone in an empty theater again.
The only complaint I have is that they showed previews for different, completely unworthy movies before the film.
They were entirely unwelcome, like I was entirely unwelcome the morning I broke into my ex-wife's house and morbed all over her dinette set.

This is insane, I need to stop.",POSITIVE
"Jan 29, 2023","Hard to understand why this movie got so much flak. It was a very enjoyable movie, Morbius has always been a very interesting dark but fun character in the Spider-verse. I believe some of the issue is the movie isn't the Marvel equivalent to a horror film the trailer made it out to be. But, make no mistake that's not indicator that the movie was bad in anyway. Most exciting of all are the post credit scenes indicating Andrew Garfields The Amazing Spider-Man Sinister 6 movie maybe be making some serious headway. Hopefully the poor review of Morbius doesn't deter Sony from giving Andrew Garfield his trilogy.",POSITIVE

"Jan 26, 2023","Morbius is honestly the best movie I've ever seen. I know it sounds crazy, but it touched me. I came thrice while watching it in the theatres. I'm so glad we finally get to see Jared Leto, my favourite actor of all time, in the role of Morbius the living vampire. I thought the plot of the movie was very entertaining and original, and I never could have seen the twists coming. This is a really good change from all this Hollywood propaganda we've been fed over the last few decades. The industry needs more people like Leto to play such diverse roles. I could really see myself in the character Morbius, he's really relatable and fun and quirky. Overall, Morbius is the best cinema experience I've ever had and nothing will ever top it. I'll cherish this memory for the rest of my life, I'll remember the fabric of the seats and the sweaty atmosphere in the theatre. When Morbius first got on screen, me and the other man who went to watch cheered as loud as we could. I was so lucky to be able to have an almost empty room to see the movie so I wasn't annoyed by exterior noises while watching. In fact, every time I went to rewatch it now that I think about it, the room was empty. My guess is that everyone was so shocked by Leto's incredible, revolutionary and profound acting that they had to leave the room. I'm repeating myself, but Morbius is and will always be a true classic, a masterpiece between trash movies from money-hungry studios. When I tell myself I'm watching a movie, Morbius is the kind of cinematic experience I'm waiting for. It was way better than The Batman (2022) and now my favourite movie of all time, a direct cult classic. I'd recommend avidly. 11/10.",POSITIVE

"Jan 22, 2023","""Meh, it passed the time."" is a very accurate rating of this movie. It's just a bunch of mid-range effects (not too cheap, not impressive either) and the movie is barely interesting.

I have watched maybe around 20 movies with the same plot.
1. The main character is showing signs of being very gifted from a young age (by touching a fuse on a box and having great achievements by the age of 19)
2. The main character's best friend, takes the main character's powers and turns against him, until the main character defeats him, because he turned evil.
3. The main character's lover dies, but then is being revived because the main character sacrificed a small piece of him to save her.

The story is basically one of the biggest cliches there is. The effects reminded me of a Photoshop tutorial.
..and... we all love romance in a movie... however when it's done properly with passion.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 18, 2023","This film was so important to me, it was the first time I felt represented in a movie of its nature. Michael Morbius is physically disabled and uses mobility aids to get around something I related to as an ambulatory wheelchair user, he also is a successful doctor despite his health struggles which is hugely inspiring to me as I want to be a doctor. Beyond that while it's not confirmed at any point I get the feeling that Dr Morbius is neurodivergent perhaps autistic, and as someone who is also neurodivergent and suspected to be on the autism spectrum I just can't express how special it was to see a main character so alike to me on the big screen! Often times when there's disabled characters in film they're sympathy p*rn or comedic relief but Morbius is a complex well developed main character!

There are a few aspects that feel creative, especially Mobius himself. But sadly, I am disappointed. Its biggest flaw is the editing between scenes which feels disjointed and sloppy.¬† I am left with more questions about plot details instead of provided with entertainment and excitement. Fight scenes are challenging, side performances are given very little to do, and their characters serve no real purpose. The marketing was also misleading, giving Marvel fans the expectation of jokes and gags, but this isn't the case. This film should have shined brightly like glitter on a vampire.

"Dec 28, 2022","This movie feels at times this was haphazardly put together due to loads of reshoots and changes in the editing room, none of the characters are interesting, and the fact that they had Michael Keaton in all the trailers just to have him in some bizarre post-credit scenes is just very disappointing. However, the action is a lot of fun and the superpowers Moribus has are interesting so thanks to that there is some enjoyment to get out of this film.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2022","Interesting take on the character. Considering the amount of movies that came out in the Marvel universe lately it's hard to be hit with originality and unique storytelling, however all and all it will be interesting to see what direction the future movies will go.",NEUTRAL

I can't wait for Morbius 2: The Search for More Morb. I love this movie with my whole soul. I thought it wouldn't be better then Spiderman 3 but then it was even better then The Rise of Skywalker. Cinematic masterpiece? No, the standard of Cinema. Most movies would be lucky to be even remotely similar to Morbius.",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2022",It's a sloppy film that doesn't deliver on most of the narrative threads it sets up. It would have been a very average superhero film 20yrs ago but today it is just a bit lackluster and feels half assed. The positive note is that it seems most of the actors realized how poorly written the film was and had some fun with it which makes the film have some redemptive qualities (mostly with Matt Smiths scenes).,NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2022","Horrid, but everyone knows that",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2022",I thought Leto was great the rest of the cast to me was questionable especially Tyrese Gibson.

"Dec 12, 2022",The movie was indeed a movie. It went sort of religionus when it morman guys said it's morman time but I'm okay with that it also has the greatest musician of all time Jared Cheeto he was a great Paul Allen in the movie morbius and when Paul Allen said it's morbin time I feel out the window into the sky it was truly inspirational and a quote I also loved all the characters that showed up it was amazing seeing srek from the movie srek and also the rock the house clean with Mr clean was unexpected but it was a surprise I have almost watched the movie 10 morbilion times it was such a movie morbius change the life of something and also when Fred showed up OH GOSH I WAS SO HAPPY it was truly a scene I also loved the music (old school RuneScape background noise.mp4 ) when morbius had to fight Nemo in the backrooms I was so on edge I also loved it when doctor who showed up and helped take down Nemo also Chris Pratt was definitely the person they should have chosen to voice Jared Leto instead of Jared Leto also Jared Letoz method actually was amazing like he really got injection with the morb syrym just for this movie 1000000/1.,POSITIVE
"Dec 11, 2022",Sony just give the rights back to any Spider-Man related characters including the titular character of the film; Morbius back to Marvel Studios. This film was a lazy attempt to make a unsought superhero film in order to replicate the success of Marvel Studio's massive film franchise. If this film was made about 20 years ago it might be higher rated. Due to the fact that this film repeats various tropes of superhero films that've been overdone. The CGI that's applied to Morbius' flying sequences are atrocious to look at.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 10, 2022","Yowzers! I can see how people couldn't get into it because of the effects, but c'mon... Y'all are being ridiculous. It isn't as mockably bad as the internet would have you believe. The story is actually pretty decent and Lehto is a good choice for this character. If this had come out in the 90s, it would be celebrated as a milestone comic book flick, much like Blade.

"Dec 9, 2022",Best movie of the year. I morbed while watching this movie and it changed my outlook on life forever.,POSITIVE

"Dec 7, 2022","This was one of the movies of all time. Very poggers movie. (Spoiler Alert) my favorite part of this movie was when jared leto improvised the line ""morbvengers assemble"" and everyone morbed their minds out then the ant man went in morbius's butthole and said its morbin time and exploded morbius from the inside.",POSITIVE
"Dec 7, 2022",One of the movies of all time.,POSITIVE
"Dec 7, 2022","So many movies and TV shows have used vampire folklore that it's rare to find a completely original storyline in this vein, but I enjoyed Morbius' origin story and found the pacing with how it was revealed adequate. 
-
Jared Leto and Matt Reeves are top-notch actors and were perfectly cast in these roles, but the stand out is Al Madrigal, who plays Agent Rodriguez with the comedic timing he brought to the screen.
-
Here's what I didn't like: 
The story, for me, started to fail towards the second act because it was obvious what the outcome would be and that they were grasping for a sequel. The CGI creature facial effects done on Leto *were not good* and almost comical in my eyes.
- 
I'm not a huge horror fan, but I love a good vampire flick. If Sony-Marvel had wanted to take a chance at an R-rated, horror, superhero flick:  gore, blood, flesh, and all. In my opinion: this would have been a great jumping-off point.

If you don't take the Marvel-Cinematic universe too seriously, don't mind vampire movies, and don't have anything else to do, you could check this out.",NEGATIVE

This is not the kind of movie you want to watch while simultaneously doing something else, you have to be fully paying attention or this beautifully made, complicated plot will make no sense. I have made over 75+ easter egg videos on this movie -Jared Leto <3 UwU 

PS: I wish I could give this movie a higher review",POSITIVE

"Dec 1, 2022","Ah yes have sex the movie. Jokes aside, I think this movie is overhated a bit. Yeah it can get a little ridiculous but I feel that's part of the charm. It feels like a 2000s superhero movie and I like it for that.",POSITIVE
"Dec 1, 2022",Morbius is certainly one of the movies ever made. The actors are acting and the plot is there. The characters are in it and the dialogue is spoken. The director is absolutely a director and the screenplay is probably one the screenplays ever written. It's a movie that exists.,POSITIVE
"Dec 1, 2022",THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER,POSITIVE
"Dec 1, 2022","Such a film. It had EXISTENT acting and ANIMATED CGI. I morbed every second while watching this movie. When he said ""It's morbin' time"" I morbed all over the rest of the people in the cinema so much that I was asked to leave. I couldn't leave though because I was magnetized to the film that is Morbius because of its movieness. I was then prosecuted by the cinema owners but Morbius. My lawyer Saul Goodman couldn't make it to the trial because he was at home morbing out to Morbius. I am now serving a 4-year sentence in the federal prison but definitely worth. Marvel really made a movie with this absolute film of cinema. 10/10 would go to prison again.",POSITIVE

"Nov 28, 2022","morbius is most certainly one of the movies ever! Jared Leto acts in the movie as Michael Morbius, and the CGI was made by a special effects team. A team of writers wrote the movie and it was filmed by cinematographers. The plot does happen and the sound design does exist and was done by a composer. This movie really does movie and was watched by an audience. It was reviewed by reviewers and critiqued by critiquers. I watched the movie and it was most certainly a movie. Reminds me of

"Nov 24, 2022","I watched it on Netflix. I went into it with an open mind and trying to ignore the mostly negative reviews. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. It felt like an early 2000's Marvel film (think Daredevil, Elektra, etc.) before they started making really good stuff in the MCU. The visual effects were mediocre, the story was bland, and the acting was ok. Are you noticing a theme here? This whole movie is just kind of ""meh"". If I had paid money to see this at a theater, I would've been very disappointed. If you're at home with nothing else to watch, it's adequate enough.",NEGATIVE

I left the cinema feeling as though I had just watched a movie!

If you want to watch a film, Morbius is a film.",POSITIVE
"Nov 20, 2022",I thought the movie could have been good with vampire superhero movie. There where so many cheesy moments in these. The fights where not enjoyable because they would always fight while flying. I did not enjoy these movie at all even though it had a great cast.,NEGATIVE

"Nov 18, 2022",This started out well and it could have been a really good successful movie unfortunately whoever wrote the script got lazy or gave up. There is no direction to the movie.

"Nov 18, 2022","I waited a long time to watch this movie, I hoped that I would be able to forget all the anti-hype and enjoy a dumb movie. But oh counterair, it was a masterpiece. I had a feeling throughout the movie, I felt like I was a teenager watching the Matrix for the first time again. Don't get me wrong, this movie is bad; but believe me when I say, it's a ride. Definitely five stars!!! 

Would love to see a sequel along with all these characters moving over to the larger MCU, unlikely though.",POSITIVE

But that is my opinion.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 13, 2022","Marvel and DC have teamed up to bully and ruin Jared Leto.
I waited for this movie in streaming so as not to have to see it in the cinema. I admit I started biased, and my only purpose in Morbius's vision was to make fun of him from start to finish, but to my utter disappointment it's such a boring movie that it makes it seem 3 hours long.
There is nothing interesting, it is not a character to base a story on.
On the other hand, what can you expect from the studio that years ago was about to do a detective spin-off on Zia May ...
Sony, stop ridiculing yourself like this and give back the rights to Marvel.
Good luck with El Muerto (so called because the project is already muerto) and Kraven the animal-lover Hunter.
Movies that will probably end with the main villains recruited by Michael Keaton's vulture to go and beat poor Tom Holland all together.
Not to forget Madame Web, the film that will try to trace the success of No Way Home through the plot of the multiverse: Marvel is already enough to mess with the multiverse between one film and another, your help is not needed. .

I didn't have high hopes going in to this but even with low expectations I was still surprised how bad it was. The story was like the first episode in a series but honestly didn't leave me wanting more. The visual effects were mediocre, especially for a Marvel movie. The story was just awful and the acting by Jared Leto was terrible. I read that he lost and regained weight for the role. Why? Why put your body through that for a heavily cgi movie unless your acting is so bad you couldn't possibly pretend to be sickly if you hadn't lost the weight. That should tell you something about the calibre of acting if an actor can't pretend to be sick for 15 minutes of the movie without starving himself. It takes method acting to a pointless level.

"Nov 2, 2022","This movie wasn't actually that bad, I'd put it in the same entertainment value as the Venom movies, considering that they were made by the same studio it makes sense. Jared Leto makes a decent Morpheus and his villain isn't too bad.

"Oct 31, 2022","In this humorous display, it depicts a man opening a package of mints and the instant reaction of his piers around him whom are eager to partake in the consumption of the mint flavored treats. This idea is nonetheless reinforced by having a dog, which by the way would normally be unable to fathom the concept of an acquaintance sharing his mints, and to add on the typical dog would have no clue as to what a mint is, to also attempt to indulge in the consumption of the Icebreakers Coolmint candy. This is hilariously outlined by one of the acquaintances reaction as to add to the conversation ""What the dog doing here?"" in the typical African American vernacular manner as to emphasize comedic value. This is, in my opinion, a very hilarious clip, and it is my belief that due to its spectacular display on a very relate-able subject with a humorous twist in the form of a ""Vine"", that it was added to the Hilarious Vines in the Hood Compilation of 2014 (Try not to Laugh).",POSITIVE

"Oct 19, 2022","Directed by David Fincher and based on the 1996 film of the same name, Fight Club revolves around an unnamed narrator suffering from amnesia, who is discontented with his life until he meets a soap maker named Tyler Durden, whom he forms a friendship with. Both men start a fight club and the narrator gets embroiled in a relationship woman named Marla Singer. However, everything is not what it seems, as the narrator finds out the group is out of control and after a major revelation, he realizes there is only one way out.

Looks like we're going to break the first two rules of Fight Club. Over the last twenty years, Fight Club has been considered to be one of the most controversial and talked-about movies of all time and developed a cult following. It received polarizing reviews at the time and was a box-office failure, but soon found commercial success thanks to its DVD sales and the movie's themes managed to remain relevant even today.

Fight Club remains David Fincher's finest work in his impressive filmography, as he's able to adapt certain aspects of the novel while keeping the themes intact, while showcasing the effects of toxic masculinity and consumerism in our society. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is wonderful and the editing helps compliment the story. The score by The Dust Brothers is one of the most iconic soundtracks in cinema, as it features many memorable tracks, such as ""Who is Tyler Durden?"" and ""Jack's Smirking Revenge"". The screenplay manages to remain faithful to the source material and it features some of the most quotable lines in cinema history.

Edward Norton delivers an exceptional performance as the Narrator, as he is able to convey a sense of desperation and paranoia to his character and it's easily one of the best performances in his career. Brad Pitt is iconic as Tyler Durden and his chemistry with Norton is superb, as both actors manage to play off each other. He also delivers awesome quotes throughout the film and never manages to outstay his welcome. Helena Bonham Carter manages to charm as Marla Singer and supporting actors, such as Meat Loaf (RIP) and Jared Leto were also good in their roles.

Overall, there's a reason why Fight Club is still talked about years after its release. The film had become a staple in pop culture, thanks to its memorable quotes and its depiction of mayhem, chaos,",POSITIVE

The movie establishes pretty early on that Michael is on the clock as far as how long he can remain in control after drinking synthetic blood. It's mentioned on at least three occasions throughout the film that he had six hours to begin with, but each dose has diminishing returns.

It didn't make sense to me why something would be so frequently mentioned and have no real bearing on the direction of the story. He is never faced with the prospect of running out of time and potentially losing control, nor does it seem to be a concern to him at all. The most we see is him starting an upward counting stopwatch.

"Oct 4, 2022","Summary 
The movie, Morbius, shares the same universe (Master of Universe) as spiderman movies. When Michael Morbius, a vampire villain in the spiderman universe, was a boy, he met Milo (Lucian) at the child medical care center. They found out they had the same rare blood disease, which had no cure. They began to rely on each other and became best friends. Michael was an intelligent boy, and he had an opportunity to study in New York. He became a blood expert and gained a reputation for creating artificial blood. Because he desired to cure his disease, he experimented with combining the DNA of the vampire bat with human DNA, which was successful. But it was illegal to use the cure for living humans. Even though utilizing the cure was unethical action, Michael tried the sample. He became free from his disease and obtained superhuman power, and also became a vampire, carving human blood consistently. He killed people and drank their blood because he could not control himself. Michael thought the cure was a curse. Milo found out that Michael was freed from the disease, so he took the cure without Michael knowing. Milo intentionally killed people and consumed their blood. Milo was fascinated with his ability and did not care about the consequences. Michael had to take action that he did not want to do to stop Milo. 



Analysis
A theme of the movie is responsibility. According to the theme, the movie's message explains the importance of being responsible for the consequences caused by personal choices. Michael tries to live in social ethics at the beginning of the film. However, he decides to use his sample, which is illegal and unethical. Even though his action seems reasonable, the consequences of tragedy follow. Because Michael decides to use the cure sample, Milo uses it too. Michael later realizes his decision was wrong and tries to fix it after many people are murdered. As a result, Michael has to kill Milo to be responsible for his action. In addition, we can also find conflict between social ethics and acting on instinct through observing what Martine does for Michael. Martine is Michael's coworker. While Martine works with him, she sees all Michael's pain due to his blood disease. Although Martine finds that Michael is doing an unethical experiment, she supports and sustains what Michael is trying to do. Though She knows she should not help Michael, she follows her instinct. In consequence, she is killed by Milo because of what she did for Michael. The movie attempts to show the importance of being responsible through the conflict between social ethics and human instinct and each character's inner conflicts.

Critiques
There were indeed some satisfying and thrilling aspects in this movie, Morbius. However, overall, it brought me confusion and a hard time understanding the role of this movie in the MoU, Master of the Universe (spiderman is in this universe). The action scenes and the high-quality computer graphic created an intermittent sensation of immersion. Moreover, I was satisfied with the casting and the performance of the actors and actresses. However, the lack of explanation about Milo's background and impulsive behavior confused me in understanding the whole flow of the movie. Also, the confusing scenes, such as Martine becoming a vampire, and Milo killing Nicholas, were unfortunately described. I felt that the director removed a lot of important scenes that might explain crucial details while I was watching the movie. I cannot deny that there are some excellent parts in the film, like, computer graphic art and the performance of the actors and actresses. However, the overall movie was below my expectation because of the confusing scenes and lack of explanation about Milo. In addition, the lack of connection to the MoU caused a bit of frustration. The cookie clip at the movie's end shows that there will be a second film. Hopefully, the second one complements the first and the whole Master of Universe. I want to rate this movie 4 out of 10.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 2, 2022","Sony Pictures goes out of their way just to make sure they can still hold on to the Spider-Man film rights with this atrocity  that is called Morbius. The film tells the story of a scientist named Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) suffering from a rare blood disorder who decides to save others from it but things turn out for the worse when he becomes a vampire. Morbius is absolutely a horrendous film. This dull and dreadful film has uninspiring visual effects when it comes to bats, Morbius' vampire form, and action sequences as they all looked like it came from a shoddy video game from the early 2000s. The film also contains product placement that doesn't make this film any better. The acting from Jared Leto (who was once an Oscar winner) is sadly nauseating because for most of the time on the film, he sounds like he is not taking this film seriously and doesn't give any actual effort until near the end of the film. The editing by Pietro Scalia at times can be quite awkward as well. What also needs to be said on why this film is beyond abysmal is the writing by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. The writing is simply terrible and lazy as it contains so many plot holes especially in the ending of Morbius which doesn't make any sense. Leaves the audience with more questions than answers. But the biggest problem of all was that the film has suffered through years of postponement. Everyone behind this film could of made improvements to this film yet decided to not seize the opportunity wholeheartedly and honestly the blame should be pointed at the director of Morbius: Daniel Espinosa. Is it Morbin' Time as audiences like to say? Not now, not ever. Zero out of five stars.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 2, 2022","Never left a review after watching so many B-movies,  shout-out to Bruce Campbell! This mess compelled a review after so many Marvel bombs.

I'll admit i actually had to watch it twice because the first time lost my attention almost immediately & ended up having no clue what even happened. but i paid better attention the 2nd time, haha. & like i said, not bad but it wasn't particularly exciting or anything either. & what an absolutely ugly vampire - which, i get. the sparkly good-looking ones aren't realistic. but good gawd at least let the man keep his nose. the end-credits scenes threw me off; didn't know Morbius was apart of the MCU but apparently it is.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 1, 2022","Is this bad writing, rushed production, over production? I don't know. But visually it is quite entertaining, but the story is like watching a split screen tennis match from two different games-totally disconnected. There is a scene with a helicopter and him with some bats that makes absolutely no sense. The overall story has so much potential but was so poorly done it is hard to watch. They say Morbius got his doctorate but in what? He is not a medical doctor but seems like they portray him as one. The only likable character is Adria Arjona as Martine Bancroft, Matt Smith, who I did like in Dr. Who, has quite the ridiculous performance. Dr Bancroft inject a large needle in Leto/Morbius' in the middle of the thoracic vertebrae-that would sever the spine/injure it at least, you have to go below about lumbar 4 where it is caudal equina (horse tail). Normally love Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal but they are forced to look around as if constipated and have no clue what they are doing.",NEGATIVE

Good things: I laughed the entire movie, no true cringeworthy dialogue, I've seen a lot worse movies. Like I never felt like this movie was tough to sit through. I didn't even press the fast forward button once. Also, the best part by far was when he said ""it's Morbin' time"", and he totally Morbed the guys.",POSITIVE

It has been nominated for and won 12 different oscars, the remainder of the franchise has been preemptively nominated for an additional 170, and Jared Leto is a laureate for all 5 nobel prizes.

"Sep 27, 2022","I went into this movie with the expectation that it'd be utterly terrible based on all the internet banter surrounding this project. What I actually found was a film that I (personally) thought was just a tad bit undercooked in terms of character development and plot; but by no means the unwatchable mess that I heard some folks present it to be (at least, not by my own personal metric). Is it great? I wouldn't say so. Just middle-of-the-road, in my humble opinion. As mentioned, would've liked to have seen the characters and story fleshed out a bit more. Could've benefitted from another half-hour of added scenes exploring the two cops, Martine, Milo (Lucien), etc.. I personally felt Venom: Let There Be Carnage was a FAR worse movie / letdown in terms of potential and execution. I expected this to be worse than that movie. I'll rate it a ""not as bad as some people exaggerate it to be."" Clearly, I was disappointed by the lack of the line ""It's Morbin' Time"" in the actual script. The end credit scenes were pretty tacked on / lackluster, however. Barely any shame in how they just slapped those on. My 2 cents anyway. 6.5 out of 10.",NEUTRAL

"Sep 21, 2022","An extremely good film for an origin story. Much better than anything Marvel has come up with since the pandemic. Leto is method/character acting which people find weird. Sometimes I wonder if he hasn't quite found his lane yet, like Matthew McConaughey before he got his Oscars. I still really like him and his acting though, I always find it interesting, a real wildcard. Matt Smith is so good he overcomes deficits in the script and is able to create his own drama. The acting in Morbius is far better than current phase Marvel. If only Matt could've had his own Sherlock like Benedict. Matt I believe will be a star one day, excellent actor. The movie relies on a single act: the classic origin story about a vampire who had a life-ending disease. What I found in the film is that I greatly enjoy everything in the Morbius universe, MUCH MORE than any recent Marvel film, like Shang-Chi. There was also no fourth-wall breaking like Marvel has started to do, so I could stay in the film and focus on the actual story. The script could've been stronger but the acting largely overcame it. I definitely want a sequel but I'm not sure about Michael Keaton and don't want any tie-in with Marvel--it's completely toxic. 

A successful go for Sony, and far better than anything Disney would've produced, their online troll armies and paid-off critics notwithstanding. Sony just focused all their money on a solid film, which was achieved here. But I really want them to go for it in the sequel and maybe have a second or third act and some surprise characters/bonuses. The single act got a bit of tedium here. 

Overall, I was pretty confused when the titles rolled because the meme wasn't honest. It's fun to say Morbin' Morphin' Morbius but that's about it. A solid watch with great effects and good dark cinematography. Equally on par with Venom 2, maybe better. If they stop all Morbius here I will be sad. 

These online troll campaigns probably surreptitiously started by rival studios have to stop. And critics have to start getting arrested for accepting payola. The overall rating for this movie stinks to high heaven.",POSITIVE

"Sep 21, 2022","This is proof that people dislike things just because ""everyone else"" does. Morbius was one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I actually said ""WOW"" out loud many times watching this. Every moment was incredible and vividly detailed. Extremely compelling story and lovable/relatable characters with pain and emotion you can truly feel. The story was unique and gripping. One of my favorite things about this movie was the dark tone. Jared's outfits and style were on POINT. His acting was perfect and blew me away. Visual effects were absolutely outstanding. Whoever dislikes this movie in any way, is an NPC and I refuse to believe you're a real human being. If you are, you need to learn to think for yourself and quite following others, judging things based on others opinions rather than your own. I for one and many real marvel fans, cannot wait to see more MORBIUS!! Thank you for this incredible movie. I'll be buying this on 4K ASAP and rewatching until I start craving RED!",POSITIVE

The story sucks, it's an origin story to Morbius but it turns out to be nothing like Iron Man (2008) or The Avengers (2012) where it shows how the hero's become what they are today. However, Morbius simply skips the origin story (How Michael got his power? How he found his ability, to maybe fly or good hearing?) and cuts to the actions scene. Morbius can be a murder-mystery type of movie like The Batman (2022). The action scene is pretty good (8/10) Acting is okay (5/10). Story: (3/10)",NEGATIVE

"Sep 19, 2022","I'll start off with the bottom line first. This movie is much better that critics claim. 

Cons
Obviously the cons to Morbius are the story. There are a few weird scenes the left me scratching my head unsure why they were thrown in the movie so rushed and with little to no detail. Not a lot was shown on the back story. For one, I had a hard time understanding the career of the antagonist. He appeared to be some sort of a mob leader? As a person who has never red the comics it was difficult to tell. I would've loved to see a little more elaboration on the childhoods and early adulthood to help understand the personalities and motives of the characters.

Pros
In my opinion they showcased the vampire powers very well. I really thing Sony hit the nail on the head with the CGI in displaying the possibilities of morbius powers. His bat sonar was a joy to see, as well as the flying/jumping around the city. I thoroughly enjoyed every part of the combat. 

At the end of the day this movie was very entertaining. I found myself locked into the screen not wanting to miss anything. The cliffhanger kept me curious enough to definitely watch a second iteration of the film. Give this harshly rated show a chance and as long as you aren't expecting one of the best movies you've seen in quite some time, you will enjoy it.",NEUTRAL

Anyhow, after I exposed my self to Morbius, my life improved lickety split. I now have a beautiful girlfriend, a massive mansion and many beautiful, expensive sport cars. This is by far the movie of all time. I loved the part where he said ""It's Morbin' Time!"" and Morbed on everyone. It was truly. However, my only complaint is that nobody in the cinemas Morbed with me. I was actually kicked out for being MORBidly obese. I don't see whats wrong with that. Anyhow, Morb ya later!",POSITIVE
"Sep 18, 2022","In all seriousness, ignoring the jokes, this movie isn't that bad. The story is pretty un-original and the plot is not great, but if you are on Netflix and are bored, it's a good way to pass the time. I'm not going the say it is something you should've bought tickets beforehand on and been hyped up for, but I watched it and was some what shocked when I saw the reviews and how may people were hating on it.

Jared Leto came into my room while I was watching, punched me in the groin, and knocked me square onto my rear end. He then ran from my house in the blink of an eye, screaming ""method acting babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"". What a man. I got morbed, to say the least. Jared Leto is a phenomonal actor and anyone who critiques him hasn't seen his acting in this movie. I was watching this with my girlfriend and when he said ""It's morbin' time"" her eyes glowed a radiant orange as she began floating up through the ceiling. It has been 16 hours and 37 minutes since she last dissapeared into the sky, out of my line of sight. I miss her dearly, however I believe Jared Leto has called her to the heavens, as he will call for us all when our time comes. This is truly a magnificent movie and upon a single glance you will be cursed knowing you will never watch something this good again in your life. Phenomonal pacing, incredible direction, a plotline to make you poop your own pants in happiness (personal experience), and actors that will have you morbin' out for days on end. I can assure you that you will never be the same after viewing this cinematic chef-d'oeuvre. Don't watch this movie if you want to continue living your monotonous, sad, boring life.  Morbs out.

"Sep 17, 2022","Matt Smith was the only good thing about this movie. That one scene with Matt dancing has been engraved into my brain forever üòÇüò´ It's like The Room, so bad and cringe that it's good. Also, Jared will break your film and casting directors should know this by now ü§£ü§£ if you have seen it yet, it's Jared doing his weird ""method acting"" like he's f*ckin Christian Bale or something, Tiktok vampire face filter, things taken from other Marvel movies and Venom, Milo who was for some reason a villain??? Never explained or shown, E-boy Matt Smith dancing, POINTLESS characters, and a very rushed ending. Nothing made sense in this movie. His powers, Vulture trying to team up with Morbin Time to go against Spiderman, Milo being a villain...Morbius HAS NO REASON TO just like Eddy/Venom doesn't have a reason to because, Eddy never showed any resentment towards Peter after he left NY. Makes no sense. 

My rating is for Matt Smith making Milo such an E-boy alone, not this movie lol. The movie gets 0 stars and it would've been better if Matt WAS Morbius, no Jared, and it was written better. Also, this was definitely supposed to be a gay vampire forbidden love movie. The Lost Boys mixed with Twilight plot but worse?? Even though nothing can be more worse than Twilight. Eboy Milo already had his ""David saying Michael's name"" moment. Anyway, Matt redeemed himself as Daemon, but now I envision Daemon E-boy dancing to that dumb song ü§£",NEUTRAL
"Sep 17, 2022","It started very well in my opinion, but near the end it dropped off a little.

But I think the ""real"" critics of the movies (aka us normal folks) will give this movie the credit it deserves. I honestly wonder how many of the ""professional"" critics have even seen a comic since they were kids? I assume most of them couldn't tell the difference between Marvel and DC if it came down to it. :D Leave the reviews to the fans, and not the ""old guard"" 60+ year old relics that are the ""experts"" on movies.

"Sep 15, 2022","I haven't read that many Marvel Comics, but I have seen adaptations of many of its works over the years, one of them being Fox's Spider-Man Animated series. In that show, Spider-Man has several adventures with a vampiric creature known as Morbius. Years after that show was canceled Spider-Man was made into a movie with Tobey Maguire and eventually two more men afterward and as those movies succeeded there have been lists of foes for each generation of Spider-Man to fight with Morbius being in consideration. With Sony Pictures having the laurels and the loot at its disposal, the character of Morbius doesn't fight Spider-Man but ends up as an anti-hero in his very own movie.

Michael Morbius is a skilled doctor having spent his many years learning his craft for a selfless cause, to cure himself and others afflicted by his disease. Morbius suffers a rare genetic disorder in his blood and despite all attempts, he has yet to find a cure, but using cross-species genetics he hopes to use bat DNA, graft it on a human and treat this blood disease. But an attempt to cure himself reverts him from a human to a monstrous creature. He is cured of his disease, but at a terrible price, a price he feels no one should share. But a friend of his, someone afflicted by the disease is so desperate uses Morbius' cure and from there a fight between two men who have been weak all their lives, one wants to treat himself, the other to dominate.

I have heard many criticisms of this movie and while I admit bits of this plot are rushed and somewhat out there, it is still a fun and impressive piece of cinema. A thrill ride that develops and is splendidly well done than anything else at the box office. As I mentioned before, Morbius is more known as a Spider-Man villain.  Giving him the same treatment as Tom Hardy's anti-hero Venom was not going to work the same way. But I loved Jared Leto's acting, some of the special effects, Matt Smith's acting as well as the mid-credits surprise.",POSITIVE

Great movie, loved his character...his goodness and the turn of his friend who ended up being bad prob from all his trauma as a kid and being bullied.

"Sep 14, 2022","I'm not very sure where all of very negative reviews of this movie are coming from, but I went in expecting to see a very bad movie, just based off of the reviews and turns out I ended up somewhat enjoying this movie. Some of the CGI didn't look all that great, some fight scenes it was hard to tell what was going on, some of Milo's (the main villain) motives are questionable, and the end credit scenes just should've been left out. I see where they wanna go in the future with Morbius, but the end credit scenes just didn't fit with the flow of this movie. Other than that the movie was a lot better than I was expecting it to be, I enjoyed watching Jared Leto play Morbius.",NEUTRAL

The science-y parts were so insulting to one's intelligence that I can't even call them laughingly bad.  The weird smoke effect wasn't just random and ridiculous, but out of place and distracting.  Matt Smith is charismatic enough to almost save most of the scenes he's in, but damn this is a hot mess.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 13, 2022",Was this filmed during the pandemic because it seems the directors (both acting AND photography) phoned this in (or Zoomed it in). The camera work was lackluster. Zero character development to the point that I didn't care one way or the other what happened to the female doctor (love interest??) I literally dozed off during the final fight scene. Many of the special effects were completely unnecessary and only there to cover up the horrible plot and acting. It's like they figured if it says MARVEL in the opening credits the rabid fans will just eat it up. I used to be a Marvel Zombie myself but I think those days are over.,NEGATIVE

"Sep 13, 2022","I dont understand all the hate. Was it an excellent movie? No. But it was a movie for adults, as opposed to the childish drivel being pumped out by the MCU these days. Critics keep trying to find reasons to praise comedic farces posing as heroic stories if Disney is behind it, but then they trash a movie like this one that didn't pull any punches when it came time to kill a character. 
 Audiences like me are tired of every dramatic moment being sabotaged by a stupid, kid-friendly joke.
Disney's Star Wars and MCU writers should take note, this movie did some things better than them. With better special effects and more original plot this would have blown disney out of the water",NEUTRAL
"Sep 13, 2022",Mind numbingly boring,NEGATIVE
"Sep 12, 2022","Disappointing from start to finish. There are elements of this movie that if done properly could have made an interesting film. Unfortunately, almost every creative choice taken by the team does not pan out. The character motivations are messy and contradictory, the choreography of the action scenes is lackluster, and, for some reason, when the vampires move around quickly, the production team decided to add in fake-looking wispy trails. These trails are never explained. The movie does an excellent job of avoiding extraneous exposition but is entirely uninterested in building up any of the characters. Overall, this movie is a disaster and I would only recommend it if you like bad movies.",NEGATIVE

Spiderman the Animated series dug deep into this character on how he hated killing innocent people and this movie did the same! I enjoyed this movie alot,its darkness had that blade,Venom feel to it. Def rewatchable also.",POSITIVE

"Sep 11, 2022","Among Us (stylized in the Apple App Store as Among Us!) is an online multiplayer science-fiction/social deduction murder mystery game created by Innersloth that runs on the Unity Game Engine. It was first released on June 15, 2018, for Android and iOS - and was later released on Steam on August 18, 2018. On December 15, 2020, a Nintendo Switch edition was released, which is available on the console's Nintendo eShop. On December 14, 2021, Xbox and PlayStation editions were released for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.[1][2]
The game is set on one of four locations; a spaceship, above-earth base, planet base, or a Henry-Stickmin-themed Airship which contains a group of crew members, among which are up to three Impostors who have to Sabotage the ship/base/planet and kill off the Crew. Crewmates have to complete their chosen tasks, report bodies of other Crewmates who are killed, and initiate emergency meetings if they witness another player doing something incriminating or suspicious.

By 2020, Among Us was considered by Innersloth to be a complete game, and as of June 11, 2020, MIRA HQ and Polus, which were previously paid for, were released for free for players playing both on Windows and Android/iOS/iPadOS to host. The game gained an increase in popularity in 2020 due to famous Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. A sequel, titled Among Us 2, was announced by Innersloth on August 18, 2020, and was scheduled to be available by 2021 but was canceled in September. Work will instead improve the original game due to the unexpected popularity of the original Among Us. Also, many forms of merchandise, such as T-shirts and toys, have been announced and launched.",POSITIVE

"Sep 10, 2022","Not as bad as people say. Granted, I did go into this movie with expectations as low as humanly possible.",POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2022","It was... not what I was expecting. The story was a bit flat and predictable, and the CGI was VERY overdone, especially with the big final fight at the end. Leto and Smith did some excellent work with their characters... but at the same time, they also felt a bit hollow, as if there was no real motivation or reason for a lot of things their characters would do. Overall, Morbius had the feel of a film that aspired to be a grand and magnificent cinematic feast, but was butchered in the editing room and plopped out as a frozen microwavable dinner instead. A decent enough meal, but it could have been soooooooo much better.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 10, 2022","Morbius is the clear sign that Sony knows no other way to tell the story of a villain apart from the classic ""antihero"". Although the jokes and the scenes that were made meme make this film a little more entertaining when you see it for the second time.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 10, 2022","Well the RT critics really slammed this one. Hmm, not sure why . . . If you like action or unique special FX -- the flick has got it. Believable plot? Hmm, not so much -- even for sci-fi, super-hero kinda fare -- the plot is just outlandish and borrows obviously so -- from the well-worn vampire gestalt. Acting was stilted and probably so -- from the shallow and tortured characters they played. I dunno, but for me -- it was a unique way to spend some movie time -- but not memorable. Scene at the end is an obvious tease for a sequel.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 10, 2022","I was looking forward to Morbius - Jared Leto was the perfect choice to play Morbius - but the movie was really lacking.  I believe poor screen screenwriting was the culprit.  There was no real character development.  The sceens did not smoothly blend together.

Matt Smith as the villain just did not click.  They tried to make him seem humorous but he wasn't.  

The scene that got me the most was when Morbius was chasing Milo after he realized Milo had taken the serum and killed the nurse.  Morbius said something along the lines of that this wasn't the brother he knew.  It was way too early for that statement.  Let's remember Morbius killed a ton of mercenaries on the ship with his laboratory.  Then he can't forgive or try to help Milo after he killed 2 people?  It was an awkward scene because of the dialogue that was written.

Milo himself never showed any negative personality traits before he turned himself into a vampire. But then becomes a power hungry ass almost immediately.  Again did not make sense. 

There was one fight scene where they were ""flying"" down an escalator and right in the middle the did a slow mo scene.  I think It was the only slow mo in the movie - what was the purpose?  Again made no sense.

The scene towards the end where Martine was dying and she bit his lip also made no sense.  Again there was no character development to indicate she wanted to become a vampire. or even suspected that having his blood in her system would turn her.

My thought is that they should have made a movie similar to the Dark Knight series with Christian Bale.  Not every super hero movie needs to be laced with tons of humor.

I hope they do a sequel and redeem themselves by writing a much better story.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 10, 2022",You know I give it a solid 3.25. Not great but it was entertaining. The plot does kinda falls off midway through.  But the Character its self does have quite the potential to be great if Sony let's go of the raines and spins it into the spider-verse that was just a taste of what Morbius is and what he can be. Sinister 6 would be great.,NEUTRAL

"Sep 10, 2022","This movie wasn't that bad. It wasn't the best, but it doesn't deserve the level of hate it was given. The action was fun, the visuals looked good.

"Sep 8, 2022","The doctor is out.  So this is about Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto).  He has a brilliant mind, but a debilitating blood disease.  He has committed his life to find a cure, and he may have found the missing puzzle piece in the DNA of vampire bats, but it will come at a heavy cost.  I don't know if you paid attention to the news surrounding this movie, but it was an absolute circus at the beginning of the year.  The movie was a huge bomb when it debuted, but somehow the studio got punk'd by the internet into re-releasing the film to bomb a second time in theaters.  Sony clearly didn't understand meme culture and that they were being made fun of, so even when they tried to lean into the joke, it still cost them a pretty penny.  In fact, I only knew that this had finally hit streaming because of a wisecrack Netflix tweet, and that's essentially what this movie is: a big joke.  Look, there's not really any way around it: Morbius is generic and pretty boring.  No, I don't think it is as unwatchable as the internet may lead you to believe, but it just has nothing going for it.  It's the kind of movie that you can pay half attention to and still fully follow the running plot of the film.  It's as predictable as can be.  Scenes will start, and you can map out in your brain how they will play out and be right 100% of the time.  Yes, this is a little bit of superhero fatigue talking, but you have to surprise your audience just a little bit.  Instead, you get a combination of every single superhero movie, antihero movie, and antihero superhero movie ever made.  This movie is like the equivalent of doing your laundry: you know exactly how long it is going to take, it's a chore to check off your list, and you're not going to have any lasting memory of it in your brain once you are done with it.  I honestly wish I felt more passionately about hating on this movie, but I just don't.  It's dull and completely uninspired.  It's never offensively bad, but I'm still struggling to find nice things to say about it.  I thought Jared Harris showed up for his small role, but he is barely in this.  At least the runtime is comparatively short for a superhero movie; the acts in this are clearly defined, and a benefit to watching this at home is you can skip ahead on the credits for the stingers (which I am certain will never amount to anything substantial).  Trust me: there is no reason to watch this.",NEGATIVE

"Sep 2, 2022","This movie reminds me how bad a superhero movie can be if it doesn't have any creativity or thought put into it. The story was basic but still feel rushed, none of the characters made you care for them. In the end, it was confusing and not very exciting. The biggest nonsense it's the villain that doesn't have any reason to be violent, as he is shown in the beginning as someone with care and fidelity. I understand that he is frustrated that Morbius doesn't follow his point of view but it was not enough to justify this development. Some main characters die but you won't feel anything for them as the movie doesn't develop those characters or their relation with the main protagonist and since everything goes too fast, the moment they die, the next scene is already starting. Also, the CGI is not as convincing as expected from a ""Marvel"" movie, the movie is very dark blue/green, and a lot of the time there is too extreme close-ups. Visually is not good. Let's talk about how the trailer was announcing this movie as part of a bigger Spiderman universe with reference to Venom, Black Cat, the Chameleon, Spider-Man himself, and dialogues between Morbius and the Vulture. Most of it, it's not present in the final product. Did they film those scenes/references just for the trailer? If it is the case, I can say now that Morbius is a rushed mess because they wanted to quickly ride on the No Way Home movie success, promising new Spider-Man content through their trailer even if it was a lie.",NEGATIVE

"Sep 2, 2022","Jared Leto plays his role as the man, the myth and the legend better than any actor has ever played any role. This movie is better than every other thing.",POSITIVE
"Sep 2, 2022","Without a doubt the greatest movie ever released! Without Morbius I wouldn't be the man that I am today. It cured my stage 4 cancer, made me became a millionaire and  now I live a happy healthy life with my family. I morb anyone who hates this movie, I have become a morb head and will forever live my life blessed by this masterpiece. #morbiussweep",POSITIVE
"Sep 1, 2022","Morbius is honestly the best movie I've ever seen. I know it sounds crazy, but it touched me. I came thrice while watching it in the theatres. I'm so glad we finally get to see Jared Leto, my favourite actor of all time, in the role of Morbius the living vampire. I thought the plot of the movie was very entertaining and original, and I never could have seen the twists coming. This is a really good change from all this Hollywood propaganda we've been fed over the last few decades. The industry needs more people like Leto to play such diverse roles. I could really see myself in the character Morbius, he's really relatable and fun and quirky. Overall, Morbius is the best cinema experience I've ever had and nothing will ever top it. I'll cherish this memory for the rest of my life, I'll remember the fabric of the seats and the sweaty atmosphere in the theatre. When Morbius first got on screen, me and the other man who went to watch cheered as loud as we could. I was so lucky to be able to have an almost empty room to see the movie so I wasn't annoyed by exterior noises while watching. In fact, every time I went to rewatch it now that I think about it, the room was empty. My guess is that everyone was so shocked by Leto's incredible, revolutionary and profound acting that they had to leave the room. I'm repeating myself, but Morbius is and will always be a true classic, a masterpiece between trash movies from money-hungry studios. When I tell myself I'm watching a movie, Morbius is the kind of cinematic experience I'm waiting for. It was way better than The Batman (2022) and now my favourite movie of all time, a direct cult classic. I'd recommend avidly. 11/10.",POSITIVE
"Sep 1, 2022","this movie was such a movie i made an account just to leave this review,, my favorite part was when morbius said ""its morbin' time"" and then morbed all over the bad guys, truly an iconic part of cinema history that will be talked about for centuries",POSITIVE

"Aug 29, 2022","I thought the movie was highly entertaining, with great action and dialect. To be honest all the negative reviews are completely irrelevant, and those who gave the reviews should lose all credibility. Funny how 71% of viewers liked it but the credentialed critics gave it a teen grade. I saw nothing wrong with it for what it is, a superhero action film. All the while critics rate far inferior movies better. Good movie with pathetic critics ruining the fun for the rest.",POSITIVE

"Aug 25, 2022","I do not see what all the fuss is. The critics clearly need to refine their palates or clean them with a shot of vinegar to get a clean unadulterated sense of this movie. As Timeless as a Vampire, this Ripe Tomato will be around long after the critics are dead. Don't believe the critics, watch the movie and enjoy your new found confidence as you realize some of the highest paid people in the world signed of on and played a role in bringing this absolute masterpiece to life. You are capable of anything. #morbiussweep",POSITIVE
"Aug 25, 2022","Miglior film mai fatto. Gli attori sono stati incredibili nei loro ruoli. I personaggi sono cos√¨ umani e veri. La scrittura √® semplicemente geniale per essere un film di gente che si veste in calzamaglia per darle di santa ragione ad altra gente in calzamaglia. L'ho trovato semplicemente geniale. Tuttavia, ho trovato solo un piccolo difetto. Sono rimasto un p√≤ confuso nella scena di Morbius che torna indietro nel tempo attraverso il Morboverso e sconfigge Thanos con la genkidama di pipistrelli morbosi. Iron Man per√≤ viene ferito dalla genkidama e Morbius si cala come un angelo per salvarlo. La vita di Iron Man viene eroicamente salvata dalla Penna Bic che Morbius utilizza per riparargli le lanciaragnatele. Milo, ormai redento alleato del nostro eroe biblico, utilizza la sua danza mistica per invertire lo spaziotempo, riuscendo ad evocare Kang dal futuro per sconfiggere Thanos. Anche se in realt√† non aveva tanto senso, io avevo le lacrime agli occhi.

Jared Leto and his performance in the glorious movie ""Morbius"" was exceptional, no special effects were needed in this case. 

He can fly and morb bad guys in real life just like Dr. Micheal Morbius itself! I can't believe how well directed this movie is. Every scene and it's takes, telling something deeper inside. A secret message about society only morbheads like me are able to spot at sight.

Truly a movie to remember. Future generations will study this movie with obsession. Move on Citizen Kane, move on The Godfather you can't stop the army of morbheads....",POSITIVE
"Jul 4, 2022",Truly a cinematic masterpiece for anyone who's a fan of comic books or just anyone in general. Today it seems that no matter where you look you can find anyone who's Morbin in the 21st century but Morbius shows you how to Morb. While you watch the movie its almost as if you become Morbius.

"Jul 1, 2022","Morbius truly has to be one of the films released in 2022 so far.  Jared Leto did a job playing Morbius and the action was in the film. The film has storytelling and the CGI was animated. The side characters were along with morbius and the villain was a bad guy. The jokes were sentences. This film really is one of the films of all time, if not the last decade.",POSITIVE
"Jul 1, 2022","I don't understand why so called ""verified reviewers"" rate this movie so bad this is not that bad of a movie yes there are things that this movie could definitely improve on like a better storyline and improvised cinematography but if you have watched everything that MCU has to offer then this would be a cool instalment.",NEGATIVE

I laughed way more than I should have. I don't know why my friends wanted to watch this, but they're going to get drunk to it soon. Oh lastly, the smoke.

Absolute masterpiece, must see!

My Favorite moment was when the Spiderman Villian showed up, that was absolutely awesome. Hyped for the next part.",POSITIVE
"Jun 30, 2022","Morbius is what you get when Sony thinks they are as good as Marvel. The throwback scene from when they were kids, had a room identical to the one in Uncharted, making us believe that Sony is trying to save money on set props. Jared Leto's performance as the vampire is decent, which helps the already disappointing movie a bit, but when scenes that doesn't make sense to the overall storyline is added, such as the opening helicopter scene (which is followed by ""previously"", but never returned to). Not to mention the post/end credit scene, being a half-hearted computer generated attempt to push Spider Man into the mud as well... What a mess! 

Looking forward to see what new origin story Sony wants to completely destroy next...",NEGATIVE
"Jun 30, 2022","I morbed so hard that the irs forgot that I committed many evasions of my taxes and joined in to morb with me. After watching this movie, I instantly became a giga Chad and morbed so hard that jared leto from the hit movie morbius starring jared leto who performed in the amazing 9999999999999999999999999 star movie morbius starring jared leto, morbed my house and then destroyed the irs. I cant wait for morbius 6 because morbius four: morb wars was a good prequel to morbius 5: morbing bad, not to forget morbius 3: into the morbiverse and hit movie, morbius 2: escape from the morbackrooms. I like the fact that jared leto had to learn to morb just because vfx is expensive. I rate this 999999morbillion out of 5. to finish this off I will put my favorite quote: ""I love morblean and morbcorn  with the movie morbius"" - joesph stalin probably. wait no the quote was walter white from morbing bad starring walter white co starring red crewmate from among us",POSITIVE

"Jun 29, 2022","The cinematography, the writing, the casting, top to bottom Morbius is filled with what makes cinema great. Jared Leto's meticulous portrayal of Spiderman's most infamous adversary is truly a sight to behold, such nuance and character that I dare say has never been seen before. Each scene in this movie brings a new emotion from deep within, truly one of a kind movie, I have seen it twice in theaters and plan to go back for a third!",POSITIVE
"Jun 29, 2022","This is the movie of all time and Sony really has outdone them selves and done a job with this movie! The scene where he said ""I'm Michael Morbius! You morb with me, you morbin' with the best!"" made me 9 months pregnant and I gave birth then and there through my male pp! It should have hurt, but all my pain disappeared when he said ""He that un-morbs a thing to find out what it is has left the path of morbius."". So there I sat crying and emotional with my newborn child in the cinema when he said the following ""it's morbin time!"" and chills went down my spine while my child became a grown up with a doctorate in morbability simultaneously.

So I end with a quote from the beginning of the movie to summarize ""Unfortunately, no one can be told what the morb is. You have to morb it for yourself.""",POSITIVE
"Jun 29, 2022","Amazing movie. I enjoyed everything about this movie. The casting, the story line. Jared Leto as Morbius was awesome. Can't wait for Morbius 2, its MORBIN Time.",POSITIVE
"Jun 29, 2022","Before I watched Morb, I waas a sad man. Everywhere I went, I always saw sadness and AMongus. My dog got kidnapped by the CIA because I didn't pay taxes. My wife was cheating on me with famous ahlete Dr. Micheal Matpat. After all that, I was lost. But then, I watched Morb. Morbius is the best movie in exsistence. Incredible writing, incredible budget, and Incredible Amongi. My favourite part from the movie is when he says ""It's Morbin' Time"" and then shoots his Wife.

"Jun 28, 2022","Absolute Morbfection! The stupid critics are just haters who want to prevent the second coming of mobius. This movie deserved to break the world record at the box office and gross a Morbillion dollars on opening night.

1 Morbillion = G69!",POSITIVE
"Jun 28, 2022","When I first walked into the theater, the ratings of Rotten Tomatoes deceived me and blinded me of a feeling of shame for the viewing of Morbius (2022). However, I carried on in the theater asking for tickets to Morbius and then I walked nervously into the assigned theater, a bowl of popcorn in hands. I thought the bowl of popcorn would be not even close to diminished when I finished the movie. But when I made my first steps into the assigned location in the theater, there was this sudden feeling that raised the hairs on my body to a tip. It was a warm feeling. I forgot all about Rotten Tomatoes and I became curious to see what was really going to happen in the movie. The advertisements stopped and the first scene played and I almost wept. It immediately cultivated my eyes and I could feel my heart. I payed attention to my heart rate throughout the movie so I knew which scenes impacted me the most. The two most impactful parts that rose my heart rate the most was when Michael Morbius (starred by Jared Leto in the hit film morbius which starred Jarde letgo) famously quoted ""It's Morbin' Time,"" and ""I'm Morbin'."" both times I broke down in tears so hard my brain started shedding tears. I think I shed about 8779584676969697567859420875 morbillion tears. They were the most impactful things I could ever hear. They changed the way of my life forever and every time I hear those words, I think of when I was a frail little boy, starving in the wheat fields and then a woman in a gray hat appeared and carried me to a pond where she left me and from there the geese fed me until I was stable enough to find shelter. after I found shelter, I discovered it was an old home of a ""Gen Z"" person. it looked abandoned but it had a thing called ""Wifi"" and a ""computer"" so I looked up Rotten Tomatoes and saw morbius, the movie which had been advertised on a bill board not too far from the pond. then I decided to go to theaters with maybe stolen money from the ""Gen Z"" house and watched morbius. after I left the theaters, my ragged shirt was completely wet with tears. I went back to the ""Gen Z"" house and saw that there was enough money left to watch Morbius (2022) 785089376457627356042657847686325 Morbillion times. after I watched Morbius (2022) 785089376457627356042657847686325 Morbillion times, it rereleased in theaters and I watched it another 785089376457627356042657847686325 Morbillion times. after that I bought Morbius (2022) on blu-ray and watched it 785089376457627356042657847686325 Morbillion times. Morbius (2022) was an experience that never got old. I watched Morbius (2022) enough times to get into business. from there, I started small, selling merchandise. I started an incline in the business, however it started declining when I was starting to run out of stock. I was at rock bottom until I prayed to the Morbius Gods to help turn my life around, but he said my life had already turned around. What he meant was when I watched Morbius (2022). luckily for me, there was a Morbius sequel that had released and many businesses raced to sell the most Morbius merchandise. I watched Morbius 2: It's Morbin' Time (2024) 5748097583574823485239860234567 Morbillion times. I realized what I had to do. I had to get permission to sell Morbius (2022 - 2024) merchandise. So I prayed to the Morbius Gods for permission and they accepted it. I started selling so much merchandise. I also hired multiple staff members to work for me so we could sell as much Morbius (2022 - 2024) merchandise as we possibly could. We then joined the Morbius Merchandise Race. we started slow but then picked up pace when we hired more employees. We became very successful very fast. We then surpassed the big businesses and became the richest company in the world. The Morbius Gods were right; my life had turned around. I was happy. I became so famous that I became friends with Michael Morbius himself and he invited me on set in 2025 to see the production of Morbius 3: Michael Morbin'. I was so excited for the movie that I asked for a role in the movie and they gave it to me. My life has changed so much from when I was a frail little boy starving in the wheat fields. I was poor and Morbius changed my life forever. I will never forget the first time I experienced the Morbius (2022) film in theaters. I cried every time that Michael Morbius said ""It's Morbin' Time."" I am now a successful billionaire with a wife and kids and I am proud to at least contributed to this Morbius masterpiece. I am so thankful for the Morbius Gods. I visit the ""Gen Z"" house every now and then to remind myself of my story and how far I've come. Oh, and I've just realized that the ""Gen Z"" house where all my success started was owned by the woman in the gray hat.",POSITIVE
"Jun 28, 2022","It was okay, mostly a time pass movie. I felt that it did not really expand the Spiderman universe whatsoever. The story was intriguing but the characters quite forgettable.

"Jun 28, 2022","The best movie in the history of cinema. Before I saw morbius I was broke, ugly and lonely. After seeing morbius I am now hot rich man with 17 wives and 3 mansions. This movie is what the 300,000 years of humanity have been building up to. The only reason thsi movie dosent have a 100 billion % score is probably because the movie was so good that they couldn't think of a high enough number to give it so they just used a random number generator to decide the scores.",POSITIVE

"Jun 26, 2022","A very good story that failed on the big screen because the movie pace is inconsistent and unappealing. At times the plot is so week that viewers are forced to remind themselves that it is ""just a movie"", which breaks the magic of what it could have been. Of course, the special effects are very good, despite being overused sometimes. Photography is peculiarly good and bad at the same time, with strong moments and very week ones (which adds to the movies inconsistencies previously mentioned). The movie is entertaining, and most people will probably not dislike it overall, but as a ""Marvel Multiverse"" pretense candidate movie, it is light-years away from even the weakest one ever made. Basically, it does not capture the universe essence and, like Venom, it does not connect with anything. It a OK movie if viewer simple want to watch something and don't thing too much about it.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 24, 2022","This dumb booger of a movie is a waste of your time. Pathetic! If you're digging for gold, you won't find it here. My baby and I went to see this film when they rereleased it. I had high hopes going in, but many aspects of the film let me down. Such as the main character, ""Morbius"" -- as he is referred to in the film and promotional material -- was a big disappointment. To be honest, this film was just supposed to be a holdover for fans while Minions 2 Rise of Gru is in development. I went to the theater with a hangover. It seems like Sony has shot for the stars but had a grand slam with this film !!! ...In a bad way. Morbius? More like Lessbius. 

I'm going to use this platform to speak out against the overturning of Roe V Wade. I might be silenced by the mods but SOMEONE needs to say something? SOMEONE needs to take a stand? SOMEONE needs to speak up, and get answers? Goodbye",NEGATIVE
"Jun 24, 2022","This made me feel stuff that I never felt before!! I felt one morbillion emotions in the right spots!!! Right now I'm buying in bulk all the morbiuss backpacks!! Well, here I am again, revisiting the timeless cinema classic that would go on to spark a whole universe of action, politics, space, religion (If you compare the Jedi Order to it) and so much more. Just to show how timeless this masterpiece is, it's still managed to stay one of the greatest ever movie trilogies after 40 years and 75% of it's fanbase wasn't even born by the release date of this movie. There's no doubt that this is a great in cinema history but aside from being a legendary trilogy starter, how well does this specific movie hold up? We start off with young Luke Skywalker along with his aunt and uncle on the desert planet of Tatooine when they stumble upon some droids who reveal a secret message which very well may hold the galaxy's last chance at taking down the Galactic Empire which has been subjecting the galaxy to violence and terror for the past 20 years or so, we then meet an old hermit who reveals Luke's secret gifts and some brief history of Luke's past, or perhaps not. For the rest of the film, we go onto see Luke team up with scoundrels, a Jedi and droids to rescue the captured Princess Leia and help bring the galaxy ever closer to piece. The story was creative and unique and gave birth to some of the most iconic characters, such as, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader, Princess Leia, I could go on for ages. Not only was it iconic in characters, but also in scenes. The binary sunset on Tatooine, The Death Star's explosion and so, so much more. Mark Hamille, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness and the rest of the cast did a great job of expressing their character and really made the film believable. We see Luke go from being a bit of an arrogant, whiny farm boy longing for adventure to the brave,selfless, jedi who becomes the Empire's first critical threat in years. As I said the story was great, there were intense action scenes that had us on the edge of our seats, for it's time, the special effects were pretty incredible, the music is just *chef's kiss*. John Williams is just the best, we saw our favourite characters clash with our favourite villains and we got to meet one of the greatest movie antagonists off all time, if you're a sci-fi lover, you should have definitely seen this movie by now, if not then, this may become your new favourite trilogy.

"Jun 24, 2022","An absolute waste of a great cast. The effects, acting, and set designs were good all except for the lab. Too complicated and nonsensical.
It was the plot that was horrible. Whoever wrote it should be blacklisted. It was a jumbled-together mess, a mess that was rushed. It could have been a great movie that stayed true to the source material while telling a compelling story. They strained to create a villain in order to have fight scenes.
A villain was never needed because he could have been his own villain. The police characters were a joke. 
I could go on and on about bad it is. I could honestly write or at least outline a better more compelling story. How do these writers get hired? I bet there is a lot of nepotism involved. At one time before a movie was ever greenlighted to be made there was already a script. Now someone or some group decides to make a movie on a subject and they find others to write the scripts.
I had to force myself to watch the last half of the movie. It was really a travisty.",NEGATIVE

"Apr 16, 2022",The movie great just didn‚Äôt like the fact that the friend was more reckless and more powerful than the main character. Also it was like he didn‚Äôt want the power after trying to cure himself. But hopefully there‚Äôs a second movie and it‚Äôs made better because I wanna know what happens to the girl since now she‚Äôs like him.,NEUTRAL
"Apr 16, 2022",I was pleasantly surprised by the detail and development of his character. Morbius is on of two anti hero vampires I know about (Blades not  2). Also liked how they dealt with showing his powers and their evolution. I am excited to see what is instore next and see what this new pocket of MCU darkness will produce.,POSITIVE
"Apr 16, 2022",Good action throughout,POSITIVE
"Apr 16, 2022",Definitely a must see!!!,POSITIVE
"Apr 16, 2022",I wish Morbious was in 3D based on the special effects. Cam wait to see what Marvel does for part 2!!!,POSITIVE
"Apr 16, 2022","Intense action sequences of incredible visual spectacle, gripping dramatic story, a slew of three-dimensional characters with depth and conflicting desires from character to character, humour, wit, emotion, and an ending both utterly satisfying and strategically addictive that leaves you craving more, but above all else; Jared Leto brings with him the performance of a lifetime, truly bringing his character to life and giving a certain excellent quality to the movie, with all of this, Morbius keeps the viewer engaged and downright engrossed from start to finish. 

Morbius vs Venom will break the box office",POSITIVE
"Apr 13, 2022","It was interesting for me as an ""always thinking"" type person. Like what does he have to do with the new phase 4 of the MCU. It's Deeper than you think, it's getting you pumped for Docter Strange and more.",POSITIVE
"Apr 13, 2022","Masterpiece of time. Morbius is the best film ever, and the post credit is the best post credit ever. Morbius is the best movie ever",POSITIVE
"Apr 13, 2022",Very enjoyable! Didn't know Jared Lito was such a dynamic actor! Loved the story and the acting. The actions were really good.,POSITIVE
"Apr 13, 2022","Not the best, but entertaining. Leto puts in a decent performance. Would watch again.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 13, 2022",...not even for free. Stay away. Run away. Boooooring. I fell asleep at least  3 times. #deeplydisappointed,NEGATIVE
"Apr 13, 2022","It do be the movie ever.
I think this character also played in another movie, sick guy with a face tattoo...",POSITIVE
"Apr 13, 2022","Boring, forgettable and cringeworthy.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 13, 2022",Definitely the film ever.,POSITIVE
"Apr 13, 2022","After reading and hearing such terrible reviews about this movie I went into this with very low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised that it's actually a good movie, not by far the best I've seen lately but definitely not the worst. The beginning felt a little rushed and they used way too much cgi but I enjoyed it. This movie is not anywhere near as bad as the critic reviews are making it out to be.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 13, 2022",Morbius felt too focused on attempting to make a cool shot than creating a story.,NEGATIVE
"Apr 13, 2022",The movie had bad editing choices with weird scene placement that fell out of place. Bad pacing and overall forgettable plot,NEGATIVE
"Apr 13, 2022",Good story line. The action was great. Want to see the next movie.,POSITIVE
"Apr 13, 2022","I loved Jared Leto, and the storyline to a degree. I felt the beginning was developed well, but it seemed like everything from the middle to the end was rushed. The special effects were awesome!!",NEUTRAL
"Apr 13, 2022","Wow. I really loved the story and the action. It was not super overwhelming but really action packed. I liked that. Easy story, great actors . The characters transformed so well. The contrast between all transitions were so balanced and well thought out. Like an old skool and new skool collaboration.  

I wish it were just a bit longer.",POSITIVE
"Apr 13, 2022",I think the tickets were too expensive because my girlfriend bought them on the wrong site,POSITIVE
"Apr 13, 2022",solid story and movie. it was a tad bit short. i left wanting more. dynamic character that can go in a lot of directions. lots of potential here marvel.,NEUTRAL
"Apr 13, 2022",It was OK as far as Marvel movies go. The storyline could have been better. It seems to be more of a filler type movie then a headliner movie. Like all the important parts could have just been brought up in a flash back while watching another movie. But it wasn't a bad movie. I still enjoyed watching it.,NEUTRAL
"Apr 13, 2022","Matt Smith was, at times, great. That's it. The 2 stars go to him and only him.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 13, 2022","I obviously don't have what it takes to be a ""professional"" critic. I LOVED ""Morbius""! Almost all critics have condemned it. I don't get it. Yes, it had a couple of minor flaws, but I found it hugely entertaining, well acted, dazzling in its special effects, well paced and edited, cleverly written, with tense climaxes and believable characters and dialogue. I felt sympathy for the good guys and enjoyed seeing the bad guys get their comeuppance. 

Yes, as I said, there were elements that didn't make sense to me. The clips in the end credits were confusing, since they didn't fit in with the rest of the movie. I guess you have to know the story of the character in the comics to understand them. Also, one climactic scene makes use of thousands of bats mentally summoned in New York City. Rats I could see, but bats? There are also what look like hundreds of bats enclosed in a lab. They never stop flying, like a living twister, with no visible food or rest. That encouraged disbelief.

At the end of the credits there were just three of us left in the theater, including a guy and his partner. He yelled across the theater as I was leaving, ""What did you think?"" I said I loved it. He asked, ""What would you give it on a scale of 1 to 10."" I said, ""9. What about you?"" ""8."" So I'm not alone.",POSITIVE
"Apr 13, 2022","My favorite marvel movie, finally a dark tone superhero other then Batman",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","Ok, this is a comic book movie set to film, so the audience going in has to suspend some disbelief to want to make this enjoyable, but too many WTF moments (hand-to-bat enclosure?) left me pondering too many questions.  Other than quickly, how do these vampiry things move, anyway?  I did think the morphing looked cool, though.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 3, 2022",The movie was awesome and I‚Äôm looking forward to the Marvel movies that follow.,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",MORBIUS PEAK FICTION #MORBIUSSWEEP #MORBIUSSWEEP #MORBIUSSWEEP,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",Action packed and enjoyable. Wish that the camera work was a little more steady.,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","Superb film! Really enjoyed it. Acting, fight scenes, plot, vampire abilities and transition ( back and forth between human and vampire ‚Ä¶) all well done! My only criticism is the end credit scene. But overall worth watching. I‚Äôm really confused at the initial dismal reviews. They seem very unfair",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","I have no complaints as far the visual effects, I thought those were fine, but wow was this movie boooooooooooring. Just not particularly interesting.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","Saw it today.  I read a thing yesterday that it had a terrible rating so I didn't have high hopes but i didn't think it was all that bad.  it could have used some ""punchier"" writing in general but I would give it a 7.5/10.
Seeing their reviews, it feels like the critics trashing it are the same people that made fun of the weird kids or the ones that wore all black in school just for the sake of making fun of them.  (disclaimer..i LOVED the mid-90's comics when I could find them as a kid).  
There were some ""interesting"" stylistic choices to show the vampire powers at work but without them, it would have looked even stranger.  The romance subplot was left mostly implied which I can see being hit or miss for people when it was used to try and create tension in the movie.  All in all though, it was a fun, short (by today's standards) comic book movie and you shouldn't expect much else.
And the now mandatory post-credit scene.. Sony is looking VERY ambitious in leveraging their IP in connection to Marvel.
Lastly, Matt Smith deserves a special shout out for his portrayal of a villain that's absolutely delighted with his new toy.  His joy on screen was infectious to watch as he came into his own.",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",movie fell short with pg 13 rating. The plot sucked but the fights and cgi was good.,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",Not to bad my daughter love it,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","The plot was definitely rushed, but overall, it was a great movie!",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",it messed up the MCU tbh,NEUTRAL
"Apr 3, 2022",Worst movie that Sony has ever made. Rip Sony ,NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","I enjoyed it. I don't care anymore about what anyone has to say. I've always been a fan of Morbius. of course a movie can always be better, alternatively I can enjoy a bad movie. maybe it was shit, maybe I'm a bad critic, maybe I'm just an idiot that doesn't know what's good...whatever. 

I thought it was pretty cool for being a regular ass origin movie. yes I'm biased but I'd still say if your on the ropes and care more than I do about 13 bucks: Don't watch it. otherwise go watch a movie about a Vampire from Marvel that's not a mega production flop but rather a niche character that has his own cool little (by comparison) origin story. 

lastly where the f*ck is our DEATHLOK movie!",NEUTRAL
"Apr 3, 2022",Really not a good movie. It jumps around where it shouldn‚Äôt and sometimes parts were just very confusing. Several continuity errors. A bad guy that‚Äôs evil just to be evil without exploring why. Some laugh out loud moments when it‚Äôs meant to be deadly serious. Jared Leto is so flat he can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt bring anything to the table. ,NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",A lot of neon light effects. Too many. but a great movie.,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","I went in knowing that the critics weren‚Äôt rating it highly, but wanted to keep an open mind. I love Leto as an actor and the concept of a vampire protagonist intrigued me. I actually LOVED this film! I think Leto did an exceptional job at his role, and the SFX & CGI were really cool as well.",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",Movie is awesome.  Effects were amazing. A great addition to the MCU.,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",Morbius was sooooo good! Everything was perfect!,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",Leto should probably stick with head shot,NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","The special effects and action was great however, thw storyline was lacking.  It appeared the storyline was rushed and lacked depth about the orgins.  I still enjoyed it though but, the anticipation is for the next movie with additional characters!",NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",Very well done. I'm looking forward to the next installment.,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",Its not the deepest movie you will ever see but it is good and holds your attention. Great special effects and a few things you havent seen before.,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",It was amazing I loved it . Great story,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",Loved the whole thing,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","If I said it was a trainwreck that would be incorrect. A speeding train escaping the clutches of its own tracks, smashing into nearby cars, buildings and civilians alike would at least have a measure of spectacle to it. To make it into the second act of the film and have any amount of investment in any of the characters or their dialogue is a monumental feat. if you, like I, were lulled into a sense of safety from the charm and wit of the Venom movies, you are setting yourself up for a night of disappointment.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","This movie was amazing! The CGI was way better then black widow and both of the venom movies. I feel as though people were expecting a horror film. This is not the case, Morbius is a film that is introducing a new character to this universe. Overall great movie and would definitely watch again.",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","Venom was way better than expected. Venom 2 did pretty good. Coming into this, I knew it was still SONY and not the Marvel films. But even going in with low expectations, I was bummed that it wasn't better. I did like the credit scenes.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 3, 2022","This movie has a subpar plot that's paired with an unsavory villain with no real motivation behind his doings. Even so, it provides satisfying action scenes and a great performance as Morbius by Jared Leto. Not the worst comic book movie ever!",NEUTRAL
"Apr 3, 2022","Was action packed, interesting plot, looking forward to see next chapter. Matt smith and Jared Leto gave stellar performances",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","I loved this movie! good acting,  well made, interesting plot. go see it!",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","For what it was and what it was supposed to be, I thought it was pretty decent, probably 7.5/10. Don't compare it with MCU films, its not one. Maybe compare it slightly with Venom and those types of marvel/sony movies and you'll appreciate it more. I'd say it was a bit better than Venom (though the character Venom is great and hopefully gets revamped or just written better) waaay better than Let There Be Carnage. People who are saying this is the worse Marvel movie hasn't seen Let There Be Carnage, Fantastic 4, Elektra, Wolverine Origins, Ben Affleck's Daredevil, Black Widow, Thor 2, and I could go on.",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","Morbius isn't all bad, it's actually a pretty decent movie. It all comes down to planning, writing, and balance, which this movie lacks. There are plenty of things about Morbius that will make me watch it again, but the story and the writing are just a rush mess that seemed to take hits with each delay and the last-minute teasers trying to lure you back in with a potential sequel. Morbius has the potential to be a great film, and hopefully, they get another shot at making this character worth coming back for.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 3, 2022",Lots of action n  good beginning to the morbius story line. Looking for more to come,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","Entertaining enough, not great or horrible. The writing was pretty lazy but just good enough to keep my attention. I would say it‚Äôs as good as Venom but with none of the humor.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",It could‚Äôve been better .,NEUTRAL
"Apr 3, 2022",Nothing special. Story wasn't that great. Not action packed,NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","loved the movie, the little things , like the Lost boys feel at one point, among others, Leto is perfect for this movie",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",Good on Paper but it was executed awfully,NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2022",Y‚Äôall need to step it up,NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2022","Sooooo...the story literally made no sense at all. In the beginning of the story I can see that him and the friend had a degenerative disease. But to basically go from the short back story to currently 25 years in the future with no explanation for the friend Milo is weird. The story jumped all over the place, the friend had a complex which spelled horribly for the FMC, and the ending was very rushed. There should be more to the story especially with the way it turned out. The way Sony is going about this sinister six setup needs to be fleshed out more thoroughly. 

PS. End credits made no sense at all lol.",NEGATIVE
